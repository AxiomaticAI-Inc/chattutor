QFL can be deployed over both classical and quantum\ncommunication networks in order to benefit from information-\ntheoretic security levels surpassing traditional FL frameworks. In\nthis paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the\nchallenges and opportunities of QFL. We particularly examine\nthe key components of QFL and identify the unique challenges\nthat arise when deploying it over both classical and quantum net-\nworks. We then develop novel solutions and articulate promising\nresearch directions that can help address the identified challenges.\nWe also provide actionable recommendations to advance the\npractical realization of QFL.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nFEDERATED learning (FL) transformed the field of ma-\nchine learning (ML) by promoting the shift from cen-\ntralized, cloud-based learning to distributed, on-device edge\nlearning. With FL, devices can collaborate in training local\nML models by sending only their local model parameters to\na central server. The server then aggregates the \nls by sending only their local model parameters to\na central server. The server then aggregates the parameters,\nupdates them, and sends the updated global parameters to all\nclients to repeat their local training. Using FL, edge devices\nmaintain their local data, leading to increased privacy, com-\nmunication efficiency, and scalability compared to centralized\nML [1].\nState-of-the-art communication technologies and services\nincorporate large volumes of sensitive data about users’ health,\nmotion, activities, and social behavior that are used in training\nlocal ML models in FL frameworks. However, recent FL\nadvances face various challenges that limit unleashing their\nfull potential, which mainly include: 1) the increasing demand\nfor stronger computational capabilities at edge devices due to\ngrowing data volumes and dimensionality, and 2) security and\nprivacy risks stemming from attacks on the communication\nof FL learning parameters and vulnerabilities associated with\nuntrusted servers [1].\nTo address computational bottlenecks at the edge in FL,\nquantum federated learning (QFL) was proposed [2], [3].\nThis work was supported in part through a Microgrant by Zaiku Group,\nthe NSF Grants 2114267, CNS-1955744, NSF-ERC Center for Quantum\nNetworks grant EEC-1941583, and MURI ARO Grant W911NF2110325.QFL can potentially leverage advancements in quantum com-\nputing for efficient, distributed quantum learning. In QFL,\nlocal clients utilize quantum machine learning (QML) mod-\nels, characterized by parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs)\nwith classically-optimized parameters. These QML models\ncan outperform their classical counterparts in complexity and\ncomputational efficiency, making QFL an effective solution for\naccelerating FL tasks.\nThe classically-optimized nature of QML parameters facil-\nitates the initial deployment of QFL frameworks over exist-\ning classical communication infrastructures. Additionally, as\nquantum communication networks (QCNs) mature, QFL is\nstrategically position\nctures. Additionally, as\nquantum communication networks (QCNs) mature, QFL is\nstrategically positioned to leverage secure quantum commu-\nnication protocols, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and\nblind quantum computing (BQC) to enhance the robustness\nof FL against parameter-centric attacks and mitigate server-\nbased security vulnerabilities [4]. Implementing QFL over a\nclassical network inherently presents numerous challenges.\nFurthermore, a seamless deployment of QFL over a QCN\nnecessitates the incorporation of classical communication sys-\ntems. This integration of both communication paradigms in\nQFL deployments intensifies existing challenges, which in-\nclude QML scalability, hardware interface attenuation, and\nquantum noise considerations.\nPrior works [2]–[6] studied the performance of QFL over\nclassical networks, while utilizing both quantum [2] and clas-\nsical data [3]. Furthermore, the works in [2] and [5] studied the\nimpact of data non-uniformity on overall QFL performance.\nHowever, each of these prior works [2], [3], [5] focused\nsolely on individual challenges confronting QFL, and none\nhas provided a comprehensive analysis of QFL’s challenges\nover classical networks. The authors in [6] provided a short\nanalysis of QFL basics and challenges over classical networks.\nHowever, they did not provide an in-depth technical discussion\nof those challenges, nor did they shed light on potential\nsolutions. Conversely, the examination of QFL over QCNs has\nbeen largely overlooked, even though existing literature has\nexplored distributed learning and quantum computing in the\ncontext of QCNs [4], [7], [8]. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere are no prior works that investigate the fundamentals of\nQFL, as well as the associated challenges and opportunities\nbrought forward by deploying QFL over classical and quantum\nnetworks.arXiv:2310.14516v1  [cs.NI]  23 Oct 20232\n2\n3\n41Quantum \nComputing\nQML\nQCNs\nQuantum \nEntanglementQuantum \nTechnologies\nComputing \nPowersSecurity \n& Priv\ntum \nComputing\nQML\nQCNs\nQuantum \nEntanglementQuantum \nTechnologies\nComputing \nPowersSecurity \n& Privacy\nFL\nChallenges\n QFL Framework\nFig. 1. Proposed QFL framework at the intersection of FL and quantum technologies.\nThe main contribution of this work is the first thorough\ninvestigation of the integration of FL and different quantum\ntechnologies (see Fig. 1). In particular, we discuss the potential\nrole of quantum computing, QML, and quantum communi-\ncations in overcoming pressing FL challenges through the\ndevelopment of QFL.

QFL OVER CLASSICAL NETWORKS\nA. Opportunities and Prospects\nDeploying QFL over classical networks offers a myriad of\nopportunities. In such a deployment, QFL can exploit quantum\ncomputers at the edge to run QML models, thus, providing\nenhanced capabilities for handling large-dimensional data.\nThis is due to the\nodels, thus, providing\nenhanced capabilities for handling large-dimensional data.\nThis is due to the intrinsic parallelism and proven efficiency\nof quantum computers [9]. Moreover, leveraging collabora-\ntive QML training across multiple quantum devices in QFL\ncould offer faster and more efficient performance compared\nto centralized QML approaches. This is achieved through the\naggregation of the classical QML learning parameters at a\ncentral server, which facilitates joint learning while preserving\ndata privacy [2].B. Challenges\nReal-world practical deployments of QFL over classical\nnetworks faces many key challenges, as discussed next.\n1) Quantum Gate Noise: Local QML model training by\nQFL clients involves applying quantum gates and circuits,\nwhich, given the current state of noisy intermediate-scale\nquantum (NISQ) devices, are highly susceptible to significant\nnoise generation. This intrinsic local noise, produced during\nthe training phase, will be inextricably integrated into the\nlearning parameters, i.e., the quantum circuit parameters. Con-\nsequently, the information encapsulated within these learn-\ning parameters will contain a combination of useful local\ninformation and undesirable noise. This inherent embedding\nof noise within the learning parameters poses a substantial\nchallenge in discerning the beneficial information from the\nnoise [7]. Furthermore, at the QFL server, the aggregation\nof the intrinsically-noisy learning parameters from different\nclients may result in the obfuscation of useful information,\nleading to an extended training period and a consequent\ndegradation in the overall QFL performance. One additional\nchallenge here is the fact that the gate noise varies among\ndifferent physical realizations of NISQ devices, which results\nin heterogeneous noise in the learning parameters at the server.\n2) Data Non-uniformity: In QFL, various clients often\npossess non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)\ndata, which follow distinct underlying di\nsess non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)\ndata, which follow distinct underlying distributions. As the\nnumber of clients with non-uniform and non-IID data par-\nticipating in QFL increases, the necessary number of global\ncommunication rounds to accomplish training escalates ac-\ncordingly [5]. While non-IID data is a well-known challenge\nfor classical FL, this problem becomes more pronounced\nwithin the context of QFL when non-IID quantum data is\nleveraged (like quantum sensor data) due to the inherently-\nhigh dimensionality of such data and its unique properties,\nlike superposition and entanglement [2]. Accordingly, non-\nuniformity in the clients’ data will pose significant communi-\ncation overhead during QFL training. Moreover, for efficient\nQFL performance, each client’s data should be embedded into\nquantum states in a way that differences in the data are easily\ndistinguished in the resulting Hilbert space. This allows for\nmore accurate training and prediction. However, conventional\nquantum embedding techniques that rely on predefined quan-\ntum embedding circuits result in lossy training and degraded\nQFL performance.3\nTABLE I\nSUMMARY OF CHALLENGES AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DEPLOYING QFL OVER A CLASSICAL COMMUNICATION NETWORK .\nChallenges Proposed Solutions\nQuantum gate noise in QFL learning parameters [7]•New averaging algorithms with noise isolation at server [10].\n•Probabilistic noise cancellation by QFL clients [2].\n•Advanced QEC techniques [7].\n•Novel noise-capturing QFL performance metrics.\nData non-uniformity and communication overhead [5]•Customized variational quantum data embedding circuits [3], [5], [11].\n•Real-world and synthetic non-uniform and non-IID federated quantum\ndatasets [2], [5].\nHeterogeneous quantum capabilities [4]•QAS equipped with quantum search algorithms and QRL [3].\n•Hardware-specific performance metrics to guide the transpilation operation\n[7].\nSmall-scale quantum devices [3] •Advanced quantum hardware to have more qub\nspilation operation\n[7].\nSmall-scale quantum devices [3] •Advanced quantum hardware to have more qubits with longer coherence time\n[8].\n•Data re-uploading techniques in local training of QML models [3].\n•Quantum-inspired tensor networks for data compression [11].\nQuantum-specific classical FL attacks [1] •Secure multi-party quantum computation protocols [6].\n•Quantum differential privacy.\n•Blind quantum computing [12].\n3) Heterogeneous Quantum Capabilities: Participating\nQFL clients often exhibit heterogeneous quantum capabilities\n(numbers of available qubits, their fidelities, lifetimes, and\nmemory decoherence characteristics) and utilize various qubit\ntopologies (like superconducting qubits, and trapped ions),\nwhich introduce a unique set of challenges to QFL [4]. In\ngeneral, QFL clients obtain similar high-level global learning\nparameters from a centralized server. While these global\nparameters correspond to a common QML circuit and quan-\ntum gate sequences, those gates and circuits are realized as\ndistinct, hardware-specific instructions across diverse quantum\ncomputing platforms available to different QFL clients. In\nthis regard, each QFL client must optimally transpile the\nhigh-level global model onto its hardware topology. However,\ntranspiling a quantum circuit from one topology to another\noften does not yield equivalent performance. In fact, it can\ncommonly lead to degraded performance due to increased\ncircuit depth or complexity. Moreover, every QFL client must\noptimize and map the global learning parameters to ones suited\nfor its specific quantum hardware topology. After training,\nthe parameters must be generalized again so that they can\nbe shared with the server. This back-and-forth process can\nintroduce additional noise and errors, which can degrade QFL\nperformance.\n4) Small-scale Quantum Devices: In the era of NISQ\ndevices, the number of qubits available for manipulation within\na quantum circuit is predominantly confined to the scale of\nhundreds of qubi\nfor manipulation within\na quantum circuit is predominantly confined to the scale of\nhundreds of qubits [3]. This constraint limits the amount\nof quantum gates and operations that can be executed and\nrestricts the feasible depth of QML models. The number of\ncurrently feasible quantum gates and operations varies across\ndifferent hardware realizations and is limited due to the inher-ent restrictions of current quantum technologies. Specifically,\nquantum circuit noise rapidly accumulates, and maintaining\nqubit coherence over extended periods is nontrivial [4]. The\nconsequences of these limitations are particularly significant\nin QFL, since each client is constrained to train a small-scale\nlocal QML model. This inherently restricts the capacity to\nanalyze high-dimensional data and substantially diminishes\nthe potential benefits that would otherwise be gained from\nexploiting high-dimensional QML in QFL. As such, the small-\nscale nature of current NISQ devices poses a significant\nbottleneck to the expansion and maturation of QFL.\n5) Quantum-specific Classical FL Attacks: QML models in\nQFL frameworks introduce unique vulnerabilities, especially\nwhen deployed over classical networks. The direct transmis-\nsion of QML classical learning parameters creates exposure to\nconventional FL attacks such as eavesdropping and parameter\ntampering. These vulnerabilities become more intricate due to\nquantum-specific features like quantum superposition which\nmay be inherently encoded in the classical learning parameters.\nKey risks include membership inference attacks , which, when\nintegrated with quantum generative models, risk exposing\nsensitive data, and quantum shadow model attacks that allow\nan adversary to approximate quantum circuit features [1]. Both\nelevate privacy and security concerns in QFL deployments\nover classical networks.\nC. Proposed Solutions and Future Directions\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we next explore\nvarious research avenues and propose potential soluti\nthe aforementioned challenges, we next explore\nvarious research avenues and propose potential solutions, as\nsummarized in Table I.\n1) Mitigating Noise and Errors: In QFL, mitigating the\nnoise present in the learning parameters entails the isolation4\nof noise from the intrinsic useful information. This decou-\npling can be performed either by the server or client. At\nthe server, new QFL averaging algorithms are needed to\nsegregate noise from the beneficial client data distributions\nduring the aggregation of client learning parameters, which is\na nontrivial operation. Alternatively, at the client side, quantum\nerror mitigation (QEM) techniques such as probabilistic noise\ncancellation can be utilized. This approach involves numerous\nstochastic sampling operations, which can incur substantial\ncomputational overhead. While QEM techniques minimize\nnoise and errors, quantum error correction (QEC) methods\ntarget completely removing errors, which makes them complex\nand computationally demanding as they require additional\nqubits for error detection and correction. Different quantum\ncomputing platforms vary in their QEC capabilities, impacting\nqubit fidelity during QML training which can affect the\nconvergence of QFL. Advances in QEC are crucial for improv-\ning their efficiency and computational demands [7]. Finally,\ndeveloping new performance metrics that quantify the intrinsic\nnoise in QFL learning parameters and integrates the QML’s\nquantum noise with conventional FL performance metrics is\nnecessary to efficiently capture the QFL performance.\n2) Developing Variational Quantum Embedding Circuits:\nIn order to overcome the practical challenge of having non-\nuniform and non-IID client data in QFL, it is necessary to\nincorporate variational PQC architectures into the training\nprocess of local QML models. By doing so, each client can\ncustomize its embedding circuit to its unique data distribution.\nThis will enhance the accuracy of QFL training while also\nminimizing the number of r\na distribution.\nThis will enhance the accuracy of QFL training while also\nminimizing the number of required training epochs. Moreover,\nto practically deploy QFL with non-uniform quantum data,\nthere is a need to develop physics-based non-IID quantum\nfederated datasets [2].\n3) Customizing QML Models and Transpilation: To address\nthe challenges due to the heterogeneity of the QFL client quan-\ntum resources, client QML model ansatzes must be optimally\ncustomized to their adopted technology, available resources,\nand input data distribution. To do so, a promising direction\ninvolves the application of quantum architecture search (QAS)\ntechniques, where the QML architecture that optimizes the\noverall QFL performance is selected. However, the search\nspace for optimal QML architectures is vast, presenting a con-\nsiderable challenge for conventional search algorithms. Here,\nquantum reinforcement learning (QRL) and quantum search\nalgorithms, e.g., Grover’s search algorithm, offer promising\nsolutions that can significantly accelerate the search process\n[9]. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop new performance\nmetrics that capture the heterogeneity of quantum resources\nand guide the transpilation process for each quantum client. By\nincorporating such metrics in QFL and optimizing QAS and\ntranspilation based on them, we can ensure that QML models\nare tailored to the specific capabilities and constraints of each\nclient. Future research should further explore the practical\nsteps needed to apply QAS techniques effectively.\n4) Optimizing Resource Utilization for Scalable QFL:\nTo address the limitations of NISQ devices and QML mod-\nels, future work should prioritize the development of scal-\nable QFL algorithms and protocols, as well as methods forefficient quantum computation distribution across multiple\nquantum processors [6]. Addressing this scalability challenge\ninvolves considerable hardware and software advances. From\nthe hardware perspective, increasing the number of qubits\nan\nle hardware and software advances. From\nthe hardware perspective, increasing the number of qubits\nand extending their coherence times in quantum computers is\nessential. Concurrently, on the software end, the development\nof advanced QEC techniques and new algorithms for effective\nutilization of available quantum resources is crucial. For ex-\nample, methods that enable achieving more with fewer qubits,\nsuch as data re-uploading models can be leveraged to train\nsmall-scale QML models over extremely high-dimensional\ndatasets. In addition, quantum-inspired classical approaches,\nlike tensor networks, may be a promising approach to enhance\nQFL scalability as they reduce the amount of processed data\nin QML models.\n5) Enhancing Client Data Privacy: The intersection of\nquantum cryptography, recognized for its capacity to facilitate\nunconditionally secure communication, and QFL, which is\nfounded on the principle of privacy preservation amidst collab-\norative learning, presents a significant avenue for enhancing\nprivacy in QFL. To thwart conventional FL attacks customized\nto QML models, quantum-based secure protocols over classi-\ncal networks can be incorporated within the QFL framework to\nbolster client security and privacy. For instance, protocols such\nas secure multi-party quantum computation, which can help\nin calculating federated gradients safely, could be adopted to\nsecure sharing and aggregating QFL learning parameters [10].\nAdditionally, quantum differential privacy can be leveraged\nto enhance the privacy of the learning parameters in QFL\nframeworks [12]. Such techniques will be integral to ensuring\nclient privacy and security within QFL deployments over\nclassical networks, thereby contributing to QFL’s practical\nviability and effectiveness. Furthermore, techniques like BQC\nand QKD can be leveraged to secure QFL deployments over\nQCNs, as is discussed next.\nIII. QFL OVER QUANTUM COMMUNICATION NETWORKS\nA. Opportunities and Prospects\nWhile existing distributed learning fr\nQUANTUM COMMUNICATION NETWORKS\nA. Opportunities and Prospects\nWhile existing distributed learning frameworks like classical\nFL and QFL over classical networks improve user privacy\nby not sharing client data over the network, their classi-\ncal communication processes remain susceptible to security\nbreaches that can leak learning parameters. In contrast, a QFL\ndeployment over a QCN offers an extra layer of information-\ntheoretic security as it allows the application of services such\nas QKD and BQC that are unique to a QCN. When QFL is\ndeployed over a QCN, the transmission of learning parameters\ncan be secured using entangled quantum states combined\nwith QKD techniques. Such measures prevent the parameter\nleakage to adversaries, minimizing the risks associated with\ndata reconstruction attacks. Moreover, by utilizing protocols\nlike BQC, the joint learning in QFL can be secured even if the\ncentralized server is not trustworthy. Lastly, unique quantum\nphenomena like quantum entanglement inherent in a QCN\nhas the potential to accelerate parameter sharing and enhance\noverall QFL performance [4], [8].5\nClassical \nNetworksQCNsQFL\nOpportunities\nQML QKD\nEntanglementFast\nComputing\nFig. 2. Opportunities for QFL over classical networks and QCNs.\nB. Challenges\nWe now turn our attention to challenges specific to de-\nploying QFL frameworks over QCNs, where QML learning\nparameters are embedded and shared in quantum states and\nthe QFL server has quantum capabilities.\n1) Managing and Controlling Limited QCN Resources:\nThe performance of QFL over a QCN is constrained by the\nclients’ available quantum resources and their characteristics,\nsuch as the quantity of successfully generated qubits, available\nquantum memory capacity, and coherent lifetime of qubits.\nMoreover, since storing quantum states in quantum memories\nentails decoherence, which degrades their quality or fidelity ,\ncontrolling and scheduling quantum memories is a challenging\ntask that affects the quality of QFL learning para\n and scheduling quantum memories is a challenging\ntask that affects the quality of QFL learning parameters. For\ninstance, quantum memories have limited capacities, and thus,\nsome quantum states in memories must be discarded when\nstored for long durations, while newly generated quantum\nstates must be stored at suitable memory locations to minimize\ntheir associated delays and gate errors, and maximize their\nfidelities [4]. In QFL, these characteristics will not only vary\nbetween different physical realizations, but will also vary\nbetween different clients with different capabilities, which\nfurther complicates the joint learning process. It is further\nchallenging to create algorithms that provide accurate QFL\nperformance and joint learning while controlling available\nQCN resources.\n2) Impact of Imperfect QCN Operations on QFL Accuracy:\nWhen learning parameters are transferred as quantum informa-\ntion over a QCN, QCN nodes must perform multiple quantum\noperations, such as entanglement swapping and Bell-state\nmeasurements. However, due to practical imperfections, those\noperations often degrade the fidelity of the quantum informa-\ntion [4]. As such, a noisy version of the learning parameters\nwill be received by the server, which can negatively affect the\naccuracy of QFL training, resulting in an increased number\nof communication rounds, thus imposing a communication\noverhead. The conventional approach in a QCN to enhance\nqubit fidelity relies on QEC or entanglement distillation ,\nwhere multiple low-fidelity qubits are consumed to generate\nfewer high-fidelity qubits [8]. However, QFL expects various\nclients and QCN nodes to have different quantum capabilities,\nthus designing distillation protocols is challenging, because\ndistillation itself can be lossy, and its performance varies withdifferent quantum technologies and available resources.\n3) QFL De-synchronization and Training Latency: Owing\nto the probabilistic characteristics inherent in various QCN\noperations, such as \ning Latency: Owing\nto the probabilistic characteristics inherent in various QCN\noperations, such as single-photon emissions and quantum\nmeasurements, success rates in such operations can differ\namong heterogeneous QFL clients. Consequently, the time\nrequired to prepare and transmit learning parameters via a\nQCN will vary across different clients after local training.\nThis can result in de-synchronization in the learning parameter\naggregation process by the server, and hence, lead to increased\nQFL training latency . For each QFL client, qubits generated\nat distinct time intervals are stored in quantum memories for\nvarying durations, thereby experiencing different amounts of\ndecoherence. When a qubit is transferred over a QCN from\na client quantum memory towards the server, the coupling\ncharacteristics of the selected qubit and the technology in-use\nwill result in different requisite times to execute quantum gates\nand operations on that specific qubit before being transferred.\nAdditionally, QEC techniques, essential for QFL, involve en-\ncoding a smaller set of qubits using a larger qubit pool for error\ncorrection. However, the use of QEC requires the generation,\ndistribution, and utilization of multiple qubits between remote\nnodes. Consequently, the iterative transfer of learning param-\neters over quantum channels may incur substantial delays due\nto QEC, decreasing the rate of QFL convergence. Furthermore,\nthe classical communications required for QCN operations\nintroduce latencies and de-synchronization in QFL training.\nThese delays can adversely affect time-sensitive quantum\noperations, like Bell state measurements and entanglement\nswapping, thus acting as a bottleneck in QFL performance\n[7].\n4) Heterogeneity in QCN and QFL Components: Navigat-\ning the inherent technological discrepancies among various\nqubit types for a QFL framework deployed over a QCN\npresents a significant challenge. Specifically, qubits used in\nquantum computers for QML model execution and in qu\nnificant challenge. Specifically, qubits used in\nquantum computers for QML model execution and in quantum\nmemories as “matter qubits” may differ from “flying qubits”\nused for parameter transmission and those used on the server-\nside. Each hardware technology excels in specific tasks but\nmay be less suited for others, giving rise to a tradeoff between\noptimizing individual hardware components and maintaining\ntechnological consistency across the QFL framework for seam-\nless operation [4]. A critical challenge here is the development\nof robust and precise interfaces that facilitate the transition\nof qubits between disparate quantum technologies, all while\nmaintaining the integrity of the information they carry [7].\n5) Impact of QCN Losses on QFL Generalizability: When\nQFL learning parameters are shared in qubits over quantum\nchannels in QCNs, they are susceptible to several sources of\nloss, due to their fragile nature. In particular, when qubits, e.g.,\nsingle photons of light, interact with their surrounding envi-\nronment, they suffer from path-loss that scales exponentially\nwith the travelled distance, and, accordingly, some qubits may\nbe absorbed during this transmission [13]. As a result, some\nlearning parameters shared over QCNs may be lost during\ntransmission, which can yield sparse learning parameters of\nsome QFL clients during the aggregation step at the server.\nIn such cases, QFL generalizability (achieved when global6\nTABLE II\nSUMMARY OF CHALLENGES AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DEPLOYING QFL FRAMEWORKS OVER QCN S.\nChallenges Proposed Solutions\nLimited QCN resources [4] •Novel quantum memory scheduling policies [13].\n•QFL-specific resource allocation and association techniques for quantum\nstates (online optimization and classical/quantum game theory) [14].\n•QFL aggregation algorithms incorporating quantum state fidelity [12].\nImperfect QCN Operations and distillation design [4], [8] •Entanglement swap-distillation scheduling protocols [15].\n•Joint QFL optimization\nn design [4], [8] •Entanglement swap-distillation scheduling protocols [15].\n•Joint QFL optimization framework for learning parameter aggregation and\ndistillation design.\n•Jointly considering number of distillation rounds and consumed states,\nstates’ fidelity, memory resources, QML size, and QFL accuracy [15].\nDe-synchronization and QFL training latency [7]•Incorporating quantum entanglement to transfer learning parameters [8].\n•Redefine convergence bounds to incorporate probabilistic effects of quan-\ntum operations and quantum-specific training delays [10].\n•QFI to develop lower bounds on QML performance in QFL, and speed-up\nQFL convergence while capturing entanglement impacts [9].\n•New performance metrics that consider fidelity and entanglement in QFL\nconvergence analysis [4].\nHeterogeneity in QCN and QFL components [4], [7] •Advanced transducer technology [7].\n•Novel physics-based algorithms to capture quantum state characteristics\nand fidelity over various technologies [4].\n•Adaptive QML training and QFL aggregating algorithms, incorporating\nvarious measurements of fidelity [10].\nQCN losses and QFL generalizability [13] •Quantum-compatible data compression techniques for resource efficient\nQCNs [11].\n•Quantum network coding for reliable quantum communications [8].\n•Semantic representations and quantum clustering for resilient learning\nparameters and generalizable QFL [11].\nparameter updates capture various non-uniform data distribu-\ntions) will be degraded. This is because QFL training fails to\ncapture the effect of clients’ underlying data distributions with\nsparse transferred parameters, as these sparse parameters play\na marginal role in the global parameter update step.\nC. Proposed Solutions and Future Directions\nNext, we propose solutions to the aforementioned chal-\nlenges and identify research directions to enable QFL deploy-\nment over QCNs, as summarized in Table II.\n1) Efficient Control and Scheduling of QCN Resources: To\novercome the QFL challenges assoc\nTable II.\n1) Efficient Control and Scheduling of QCN Resources: To\novercome the QFL challenges associated with limited QCN\nresources, novel scheduling and resource allocation algorithms\nare needed. For instance, developing efficient quantum mem-\nory scheduling policies, which require careful analysis of\ncutoff times (times after which a stored qubit is discarded),\nis necessary to ensure a high quality of quantum states\nused to transfer QFL learning parameters [14]. Similarly, the\noptimal allocation of the generated quantum states to the\navailable quantum memory is crucial for maximizing fidelity\nand, in turn, improving the quality of the transferred learning\nparameters and QFL accuracy. For this goal, tools from online\noptimization and classical and quantum game theory , e.g.,\nmatching games , can be utilized to achieve optimal associ-\nations between QCN resources. Finally, new QFL averagingalgorithms are needed to incorporate the fidelities of quantum\nstates that carry the learning parameters in the global QFL\nparameter update at the server side.\n2) Joint Optimization of QCN and QFL: To enhance the\nfidelity of quantum states carrying QFL learning parameters\nover a QCN, novel entanglement swap-distillation scheduling\nalgorithms are essential. These algorithms aim to maximize the\nfidelity of quantum states and thereby improve QFL accuracy.\nConcurrently, they must also ensure sufficient availability\nof QCN resources for the parameter transfer process. In\naddition, there is a need to develop a framework for the\njoint optimization of QFL learning parameter aggregation\nand QCN distillation operations in terms of the number of\ndistillation rounds and the amount of quantum states consumed\nduring distillation [15]. This optimization framework must\nalso account for available quantum memory resources, their\nfidelities, QML models’ scale, and overall QFL accuracy [13].\n3) QFL Convergence Analysis with Entanglement: Quan-\ntum entanglement can mitigate the QFL training de-\nsynch\nnvergence Analysis with Entanglement: Quan-\ntum entanglement can mitigate the QFL training de-\nsynchronization challenge (see Section III-B3). For instance,\nwhen QFL clients and server share entangled states, the direct\ntransfer of learning parameters over quantum channels can be\ncircumvented. Instead, protocols like entanglement teleporta-\ntion and superdense coding can be employed, requiring only\nstraightforward manipulation of the shared entangled states7\n[8]. Consequently, entanglement distribution can potentially\nminimize de-synchronization between learning parameters at\nthe server, which helps to increase QFL convergence rates.\nAdditionally, analysis of convergence rates for QFL over\na QCN must be redone so as to capture quantum-specific\ntraining delays. For instance, concepts such as quantum Fisher\ninformation (QFI) should be incorporated to identify lower\nbounds on the training of local QML models. Moreover, QFI\ncan be used to develop new algorithms to speed-up QFL\nconvergence. Finally, new performance metrics that capture\nthe fidelity of shared entangled states and their lifetimes must\nbe integrated in the QFL convergence analysis [9].\n4) Efficient Transducers and Adaptive QFL Algorithms:\nTo overcome the heterogeneity of QCN and QFL components\nas well as the different technologies used for each element\nof QFL over a QCN, novel transducer hardware must be\ndeveloped to efficiently map and transfer quantum states\nfrom one technology interface to another. Furthermore, novel\nalgorithms with hardware-based controls and performance\nmetrics must be developed to capture qubits characteristics and\nfidelities over the various quantum interfaces. Additionally,\nthere is a need for adaptive QML training and QFL aggregation\ntechniques that incorporate metrics and measures of qubit\nfidelity over all QFL elements [7].\n5) Resource-efficient QCNs for Generalizable QFL: To en-\nhance QFL generalizability (see Section III-B5), non-uniform\nclient data distributions must be captur\nance QFL generalizability (see Section III-B5), non-uniform\nclient data distributions must be captured in the global learn-\ning parameters. Henceforth, we must ensure reliable qubit\ntransfer over QCNs to avoid losing information and pro-\nducing sparse learning parameters. Accordingly, developing\nresource-efficient QCNs is necessary to minimize the amount\nof resources utilized during the transfer of QFL learning\nparameters. This is because resource-efficient QCNs allow\nthe use of higher quality QEC, which ensures reliability in\nsharing learning parameters. Henceforth, quantum-compatible\ndata compression must be investigated, since they can mini-\nmize the quantum data transmitted over QCNs, and enhance\nQFL efficiency. Additionally, quantum network coding can\nenhance QCN efficiency and QFL generalizability. Finally,\nimplementing dimensional reduction techniques, such as quan-\ntum clustering and semantic representations, is crucial before\nquantum data embedding in QFL to analyze hidden data\nstructures. This process allows QML models to train using\noriginal data structure, enhancing resilience against parameter\nsparsity and improving QFL performance [11].\nIV. C ONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nQFL is an emerging field with significant practical potential,\nnotably in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and military\napplications. In this paper, we have presented a comprehen-\nsive analysis of QFL deployments over both classical and\nquantum networks, while thoroughly examining the associated\nchallenges and proposing solutions and future directions.\nBuilding on the proposed vision for QFL, we conclude with\nseveral recommendations, sequentially arranged from short-\nterm to long-term priorities:1) Measuring Quantum Advantage: Identifying when QFL\noutperforms classical FL requires advanced algorithms and\nbenchmarks for accurate comparisons. Further, a detailed\nanalysis of QML and QCN metrics is vital to establish QFL’s\nadvantages over such networks, aiding in pinpointing suitable\n\nN metrics is vital to establish QFL’s\nadvantages over such networks, aiding in pinpointing suitable\npractical use-cases.\n2) Classical-Quantum QFL Interoperability: To enable\nseamless QFL operation in hybrid quantum-classical network\narchitectures, interfaces between quantum and classical optics\nmust be developed. Optical fibers should also be optimized\nto handle both signal types, supported by efficient frequency\nconversion schemes in the semi-optical terahertz range. This\nwill notably boost QFL’s speed and efficiency.\n3) Ultimate QFL Security: While QCNs promise enhanced\nsecurity for QFL, they are not immune to specific attacks\nand risks. Addressing these vulnerabilities calls for focused\nresearch in advanced quantum and post-quantum cryptography,\nalong with novel hardware-based designs of QFL’s integration\nwith BQC to fortify QFL’s security infrastructure.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P.

      "contents": "On noise in swap ASAP repeater chains:\nexact analytics, distributions and tight approximations\nK. Goodenough,1T. Coopmans,2and D. Towsley1\n1College of Information and Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Amherst,\n140 Governors Dr, Amherst, Massachusetts 01002, USA\n2Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands\nLosses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement in quantum networks,\nwhich can be overcome by the implementation of quantum repeaters. The most basic form of a\nquantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary\nlinks are probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two adjacent links\nhave been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be swapped, decoherence is experienced,\nturning the fidelity of the entangled state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable.\nFully characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an open problem.\nHere, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced repeaters, where we find exact analytic\nformulae for all moments of the fidelity up to 25segments. We obtain these formulae by providing\na general solution in terms of a generating function ; a function whose n’th term in its Maclaurin\nseries yields the moments of the fidelity for nsegments. We generalize this approaches as well\nto aglobal cut-off policy — a method for increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement\ndelivery times — allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need for\nMonte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the average fidelity that are\nexponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We\nuse this to analytically calculate the secret-key rate when the distributed entanglement is used for\nquantum-key distribution, both with and without binning methods. I\ntributed entanglement is used for\nquantum-key distribution, both with and without binning methods. In follow-up work we exploit\na connection to a model in statistical physics to numerically calculate quantities of interest for the\ninhomogeneous multipartite case.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum communication allows for benefits inacces-\nsible with classical communication alone, key examples\nincluding secure key distribution [1, 2], secret sharing [3,\n4] and distributed quantum computation [5, 6]. These\nprotocols all rely on end-users sharing entanglement. A\nquantum internet [7] would allow for the distribution\nof such entanglement over large distances. One way\nto achieve this distribution is to transmit states over\noptical fibers; this has the benefit of being able to use\npre-existing classical infrastructure [8].\nOne bottleneck of quantum communication is losses,\nwhere the success probability of a single photon ar-\nriving end-to-end over a distance Lis given by\np= exp\u0010\n−L\nLatt\u0011\n,Latt≈22kilometers. A naive\namplification of the signal to overcome this (as one\ndoes in the classical case) is prohibited by the no-\ncloning theorem. Fortunately, quantum repeaters [9]\nprovide a solution. That is, by splitting the total length\nintonsegments and generating entanglement over the\nsegments, end-to-end entanglement can be created by\nperforming so-called entanglement swaps [10]. Assuming\nthat entanglement is swapped as soon as possible ( swap\nASAP) one can show that the state delivery rate now\nscalesas O\u0000n√p\u0001\n(whereweassumehereandintherestof\nthe paper that the swaps are deterministic). Thus, while\nthe rate still decays exponentially with the distance, the\ndelivery rate increases significantly compared to the case\nwithout repeaters.Although repeaters have the ability to increase the\ndelivery rate, they also introduce additional noise, low-\nering the quality of the delivered entanglement. There\nare two contributions to this additional noise [11, 12].\nFirst, noise arising from imperfections\nere\nare two contributions to this additional noise [11, 12].\nFirst, noise arising from imperfections in the devices\n(such as state preparation); second, noise arising from\nmemory decoherence. Note that the first type of noise\nis deterministic. In contrast, the second type of noise is\nrandom. This is due to the fact that a node needs to\nwait for a random amount of time until both its incident\nlinks are present before a swap can be performed. This\nrandom noise causes the fidelity of the end-to-end state\nto be a random variable.\nThe trade-off between increasing the rate and the aver-\nage fidelity complicates understanding what can be done\nwith near-term devices, especially in combination with\nso-called cut-off policies . A cut-off policy is one that sets\nathresholdforwhentodiscardthepresententanglement.\nAfter this discard, the entanglement generation is started\nanew. Discarding generated entanglement reduces the\nrate at which entanglement is delivered, but, by a clever\nchoice of a cut-off policy, will mitigate the time spent\non distributing end-to-end entanglement with too low\na fidelity. A cut-off policy thus allows for a trade-off\nbetween the rate and quality of the delivered end-to-end\nentanglement. Cut-off policies and their trade-offs have\nbeen studied, for example, in [11–24].\nHowever, analytic expressions for the expected fidelity\nin the presence or absence of cut-off policies have been\nderived only up to 8segments [21]. Here, we analytically\ncalculate the average fidelity of the delivered state forarXiv:2404.07146v1  [quant-ph]  10 Apr 20242\nhomogeneous swap ASAP repeater chains up to length\n25. Furthermore, we find closed-form expressions for\nthe probability distribution of the fidelity for up to\n10segments. While the analytical expressions grow\nunwieldy very fast, we find a closed-form expression\nof a so-called generating function — a function whose\nMaclaurin series coefficients correspond to the average\nnoise parameters. This, in a sense, fully characterizes\neries coefficients correspond to the average\nnoise parameters. This, in a sense, fully characterizes the\naverage noise for swap ASAP repeater chains of arbitrary\nlengths. Using tools from analytic combinatorics, we use\nthis generating function to find simple approximations\nthat are provably asymptotically tight, and which in\npractice are indistinguishable from exact results already\nfor three and more segments. As a caveat, we assume\nfor the exact analytics that the end nodes experience no\ndecoherence, which holds when performing quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) [1] (when the states at the end nodes\ncan be measured directly) or can be justified in the case\nwhere the end nodes have significantly more resources\nthan the repeater chain, see also [21] for a similar setup.\nWe note that a specific type of generating function,\nthe probability generating function, has been used before\nin the noise analysis for more general quantum repeater\nprotocols, rangingupto n= 8segmentsforafullanalysis\nof all moments of the fidelity [21]. Our generating\nfunction is strictly more powerful, since it captures all\nprobability generating functions at once; its n’th term is\nexactly the probability generating function associated to\nnsegments. This thus provides an explanation for the\nexpressions from [21], where the expressions were found\nthrough brute-force calculation. By taking appropriate\nderivatives/expansions of our generating function, we\ncompute an analytical expression of the average fidelity\nup to 25 segments within seconds, and find an analytical\nexpression for the distribution of the fidelity up to 10\nrepeater segments.\nWe also show how most of our tools can be applied\nto aglobalcut-off policy. This cut-off policy does not\nrequire any communication between the nodes, making\nit especially relevant for near-term quantum networks.\nWe show how our tools can be used to 1) understand\nthe effect of adding or removing repeaters for a given\ndistance, 2) derive the distribution of the noise an\nect of adding or removing repeaters for a given\ndistance, 2) derive the distribution of the noise and\nhow it relates to the cut-off threshold, 3) calculate the\nsecret-key rate exactly for up to 10 segments, with and\nwithout so-called binning strategies , 4) understand the\ninteraction between decoherence and losses in a manner\nthat is independent of the number of repeaters.\nAll of our analytical results can be found in the\nprovided Mathematica files [25].\nWe leave most of the technical details to the Appendix,\nand focus on the general concepts in the main text. We\nstart by making explicit our model in Section II, where\nwe also discuss the global cut-off policy. In Section III we\ngiveageneraloverviewofhowtocalculateexactanalytics\n(with and without a global cut-off). Section IV presents\nan overview of the derivation of the approximation for\nthe average fidelity, which is based on techniques fromanalytic combinatorics. For our final result we focus\nin Section V, not on the average fidelity, but on the\nassociated distribution. We close each of the previous\nthree sections by applying our tools to numerical explo-\nration of repeater chains. We conclude with a discussion\nin Section VI, where we discuss possible extensions\nand touch upon follow-up work that extends some of\nour results numerically to both the inhomogeneous and\nmultipartite setting.\nII. SWAP ASAP REPEATER MODEL\nInthisSectionwefirstpresentthebasicsetupofaswap\nASAP repeater chain in the case of qubit depolarizing\nnoise. We then discuss how our results extend to a large\nset of other noise models. Afterwards, we discuss the cut-\noff policy relevant for this work. We note that a similar\nsetup was also investigated in [21].\nA. Model details\nThe aim of this section is to lay out our model\nof a swap ASAP repeater chain. A repeater chain\nconsists of nsegments, separated by n−1repeater\nnodes. We order the nsegments from left to right by\ni= 1, . . . , n. Swap ASAP means that elementary link\ngeneration is attempted in par\neft to right by\ni= 1, . . . , n. Swap ASAP means that elementary link\ngeneration is attempted in parallel over each segment\nin a given round. We will assume that rounds are\ndiscretized (with duration equal to a single timestep),\nand label the round in which segment isucceeds by ti,\nwhere ti≥1. Link generation succeeds with a uniform\nprobability pacross all segments. We assume that link\ngeneration is attempted again only aftersuccessful end-\nto-endentanglementgenerationorafterreachinga cut-off\ncondition (seethenextsubsection). Thisisnotonlydone\nto aid in the analysis, but it also prevents congestion and\nis closer to the capabilities of near-term devices.\nAs soon as a repeater holds two adjacent links a swap\nis performed, which we assume to be deterministic. We\nshow an example evolution of a swap ASAP repeater\nchain in Fig. 1, where t1= 3,t2= 2,t3= 4,t4= 1\nandt5= 2.\nThe decoherence experienced in a given run will be de-\ntermined by the number of rounds each node has to wait\nuntil it can swap, along with the quality of the memory.\nWe describe noise in the system with depolarizing noise.\nThat is, our states are of the form Λ|ψ⟩⟨ψ|+ (1−Λ)I\n4,\nwhere√\n2|ψ⟩=|00⟩+|11⟩andΛ∈[0,1]. From Λ, we\ncalculate the fidelity to be Λ +1−Λ\n4=3\n4Λ +1\n4. The\nusage of the parameter Λis convenient — swapping two\nstates with parameters Λ′andΛ′′gives a new state with\nparameter Λ′·Λ′′. Furthermore, decoherenceoverasingle\ntime step corresponds to the map Λ7→λΛfor some\nλ∈[0,1]. Here and in what follows, we focus on Λ, since\nit completely characterizes the quantum state, such that3\notherqualityindicators(suchasfidelity)canbeextracted\nfrom it.\nLet us consider a concrete example. In Fig. 1 the\ndecoherence experienced by the memory in the repeater\nholding links 2and3is equal to λ|2−4|=λ2, where λ\nis the noise parameter associated with a single round of\ndecoherence. This is the case since after generating link\n2at time t= 2, the memory needed to be stored until\ntime t= 4before it could be swapped with l\n link\n2at time t= 2, the memory needed to be stored until\ntime t= 4before it could be swapped with link 3.\nImportantly, we will ignore the noise that the end\nnodes would have to incur if they had to keep their states\nstored until all other links have succeeded. This can be\njustified exactly when QKD is performed (in which case\nthe states at the end nodes can be measured directly), or\nwhen the end nodes are assumed to have significantly\nbetter equipment or error correction. See [21] for a\ntreatment that includes this noise.\nWith knowledge of which swaps were performed and\nhow long certain memories were decohering, it is possible\nto calculate the noise parameter Λdescribing the final\nstate. We show in the next section how to calculate the\nexpectation value of the final noise parameter. Finally,\nfrom linearity of expectation, we can calculate the av-\nerage fidelity E[F] =3\n4E[Λ] +1\n4from the average Λ\nparameter.\nWe note that this model also includes noisy state gen-\neration. Namely, if Λis the end-to-end noise parameter\nfor the case of perfect state generation, then the average\nnoise parameter with noisy state generation is given by\nΛ·Qn\ni=1λgen,i. Here λgen,iare the noise parameters\ncorrespondingtothe nnoisylinks, resultinginaconstant\nmultiplicative factor to the Λparameter. In what follows\nhowever, we will assume that link generation is perfect\nunless explicitly mentioned.\nB. Extension to general noise models\nAbove, we chose the single-qubit depolarizing channel\nas the noise model. The properties that make this noise\nmodel amenable to analysis is the fact that decoherence\ncorresponds to multiplication of the λparameter, and\nthat swapping two states corresponds to multiplication\nof the λparameters. We derive in Appendix B that\nif the state is a two-qubit maximally-entangled state,\nthenanyqubit Pauli channel Nhas these properties.\nConsequently, the analysis in this work straightforwardly\nextends to any qubit Pauli noise model. The parameter\nupdateisachievedbyachangeofv\nstraightforwardly\nextends to any qubit Pauli noise model. The parameter\nupdateisachievedbyachangeofvariablesof N: westart\nout with the usual parameterization of a Pauli channel,\nN(ρ) =pI·ρ+pX·XρX†+pY·Y ρY†+pZ·ZρZ†,\nwhere {pI, pX, pY, pZ}is a probability distribution over\nthe Pauli matrices I, X, Y, Z andρa single-qubit density\nmatrix. We now re-parameterize N=N⃗λusing four new\nTimeb)a)t= 1 t= 2 t= 3 t= 4\nt1= 3\nt2= 2t3= 4\nt4= 1t5= 2\nFIG. 1: The used model for a swap ASAP repeater\nchain. In the top figure a) we show the evolution of the\npresent entanglement in the network. At time t= 1the\nfourth link gets created, at time t= 2both link 2 and 5\nare generated. Since we are considering the swap ASAP\nmodel, link 4 and 5 are swapped at this time. At time\nt= 3link 1 is created and swapped with link 2. Finally,\nat time t= 4the third link is created, which is\nimmediately swapped on both sides, leading to\nend-to-end entanglement. In b) we summarize the total\nevolution of a single run. The decoherence experienced\ncorresponds to the waiting time between the different\nlinks, indicated by dashed lines. The dotted lines\ncorrespond to having to wait until all links have been\ncreated, which are not relevant when performing tasks\nsuch as QKD.\nvariables ⃗λ= (λ1, λ2, λ3, λ4)which we define as\nλ1=pI+pX+pY+pZ= 1,\nλ2=pI+pX−pY−pZ,\nλ3=pI−pX+pY−pZ,\nλ4=pI−pX−pY+pZ.\nTo verify that this change of variables satisfies the\nabove criteria, it is straightforward to calculate that first\napplying N⃗λ, followed by applying N⃗λ′, is the same as\napplying N(λ1·λ′\n1,λ2·λ′\n2,λ3·λ′\n3,λ4·λ′\n4). As a simple example,\nconsider dephasing noise (which was also considered\nin [21]), where4\nN(·) =p(·) + (1 −p)Z(·)Z†(2.1)\n=\u00121 +λ2\n2\u0013\n(·) +\u00121−λ2\n2\u0013\nZ(·)Z†(2.2)\n=N(1,1−2p,1−2p,1)(·). (2.3)\nMultiplicativity under swapping is also satisfied for\nthe general qubit Pauli channel. We denote by ρ(⃗λ)the\nresultant state after N⃗λhas acted on one of the qubits\nof a maximally entangled state. An entanglement swap\non the states ρ(⃗λ)\n acted on one of the qubits\nof a maximally entangled state. An entanglement swap\non the states ρ(⃗λ)andρ(⃗λ′)then yields the state ρ(λ1·\nλ′\n1, λ2·λ′\n2, λ3·λ′\n3, λ4·λ′\n4)after correction, independently\nof the correction that needed to be applied. Since\nall the λiterms are multiplied pointwisely, all of the\nanalysis that we do in this paper for the λparameter for\ndepolarizing can be directly translated to the individual\nλiparameters. In Appendix B, we also examine the case\nwhere the link between nodes is given by a maximally-\nentangled states on two qudits, i.e. the more general\ncase where the local Hilbert space has dimension ≥2.\nSpecifically, we show that the multiplicativity properties\nabove hold for X-symmetric channels. These are the\nchannels corresponding to a probabilistic application of\nd-dimensional qudit Pauli operators XaZb(with a, b∈\n{0,1, . . . , d −1}), where the probability for XaZbis equal\nto the probability for X−aZb. The qubit case follows\nsince any qubit Pauli channel is X-symmetric. Our\nanalysis is thus applicable to dephasing (also considered\nin [21]), but also to (biased) depolarizing noise and\nrelevant noise models for GKP qudits, see [26–29]. Our\nderivation is based on interpreting the composition of\nqudit Pauli channels as a type of convolution, which\nallows us to use tools from Fourier theory on finite\nAbelian groups.\nC. The global cut-off policy\nWewillnowdescribethecut-offpolicythatweconsider\nin this paper, which we refer to as the globalcut-off\npolicy. This policy does not require any of the nodes\nto communicate information to far away nodes, making\nthis policy particularly appealing for near-term quantum\nnetworks. We depict the global cut-off policy visually\nin Fig. 2. For completeness, we discuss in Appendix A a\nnumber of other policies, but which are outside the scope\nof this paper.\nThe global cut-off imposes a constraint on how long\nit may take to establish end-to-end entanglement. That\nis, starting from a chain with no entanglement pre\ny take to establish end-to-end entanglement. That\nis, starting from a chain with no entanglement present,\na timer is initialized to 0and increases by one after\nevery elementary link generation attempt. Then, the\nordinary swap ASAP protocol is followed. There are two\nthings that can happen. If end-to-end entanglement is\nestablished before the timer reaches Tc, the timer is reset\nand the swap ASAP protocol is performed once again. If,\nhowever, the timer reaches Tcrounds (i.e. the cut-off isGlobalTimet1= 3\nt2= 2t3= 4\nt4= 1t5= 2\nFIG. 2: Graphical description of the global cut-off\npolicy. Each of the nodes has agreed on a parameter Tc.\nFor the global cut-off, a reset is performed when after\nTcrounds end-to-end entanglement has not been\nestablished.\nreached), the present entanglement is thrown away and\nthe swap ASAP protocol starts anew.\nFig. 2 shows an example of the global cut-off policy. In\nthis case, the third link did not succeed before the timer\nTc= 3, and the entanglement will be discarded.\nIII. RECURSION RELATION FOR THE SWAP\nASAP REPEATER MODEL\nWith the considered model of a swap ASAP repeater\nchain in hand, we can start to analyze the average end-\nto-end fidelity.\nIn subsection IIIA we deal first with the case of no\ncut-off policy. In subsection IIIA1 we sketch how to\ngeneralize the approach of the previous section to a\nglobal cut-off. We furthermore also discuss why a similar\napproach fails for the local cut-off policy, and how to\ncalculate the higher-order moments of Λ(which was also\ndone before in [21]). We conclude in subsection IIIB\nby applying our results to parameter exploration for\nrepeaters.\nA. Analytics without a cut-off policy\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability of observing\na specific instance. An instance is characterized by\na sequence t= (t1, t2, . . . , t n), where the ti≥1are\nintegers indicating the round in which link isucceeded,\nsee Section II. A single link isucceeds in round tiwith\nprobability p(1−p)ti−1= (1−q)qti−1, where q≡1−p.\nA to\non II. A single link isucceeds in round tiwith\nprobability p(1−p)ti−1= (1−q)qti−1, where q≡1−p.\nA total of nlinks with associated t= (t1, t2, . . . , t n)then\noccurs with probability5\nnY\ni=1(1−q)qti−1(3.1)\n=\u00121−q\nq\u0013n\nqPn\ni=1ti. (3.2)\nLet us now consider the decoherence for a given\ninstance t. Each node that is not an end node has two\nneighboring links, which succeed at times tiandti+1.\nSwapping as soon as possible means that the swap occurs\nwhen the latest of the two links got created, i.e. at time\nmax( ti, ti+1). The link that got created first was created\nat time min(ti, ti+1). Thus, the corresponding node has\nto wait max( ti, ti+1)−min(ti, ti+1) =|ti−ti+1|time\nsteps, over which the associated memory experiences\ndecoherence.\nSince a memory experiences a decay of λfor each\ntime step, every node that is not an end node adds\na multiplicative factor of λ|ti−ti+1|, leading to a total\ndecay parameter of Λ = λPn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|=λK(t), where\nK(t)≡Pn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|is the aggregate waiting time.\nWe will also refer to Kas theroughness parameter of t.\nHow about the end nodes? The end nodes have to keep\ntheir state stored until end-to-end entanglement has been\nestablished. By definition, end-to-end entanglement gets\nestablished at max( t), so that the first and last node have\nto store entanglement for max( t)−t1andmax( t)−tn\nrounds, respectively. This leads to an additional total\ndecoherence parameter of λ2 max( t)−t1−tn. The average\nnoise parameter E[λend]can then be written as\n\u00121−q\nq\u0013nX\nt\u0010\nqPn\niti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλ(2 max( t)−t1−tn)+Pn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, we will now drop\ntheλ2 max( t)−t1−tnfactor.\nWe are interested in calculating the average noise\nparameter for nsegments, i.e.\nE[Λn] =\u00121−q\nq\u0013nX\nt\u0010\nqPn\niti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n=∞X\nk=0P(Kn=k)λk\n=HKn(λ)\n≡Hn, (3.3)\nwhere HX(z)is shorthand for the probability generating\nfunction of the random variable Xand we introduced a\nsubscript to indicate the associated number of segments\nn. It follows that E[Λn]is equal to t\nuced a\nsubscript to indicate the associated number of segments\nn. It follows that E[Λn]is equal to the probability\ngenerating function of the roughness parameter Kn=Pn−1\ni=1|ti−ti+1|, first observed in [21]. This interpreta-\ntion is useful for two reasons. First, any method to calcu-\nlateE[Λn](orE[Λn(Tc)]), allows for the determinationof any of the higher-order moments E[(Λn)m]. This can\nbe done by repeating the method but with λreplaced by\nλm, since\nE[(Λn)m] =∞X\nk=0P(Kn=k)\u0000\nλk\u0001m\n=∞X\nk=0P(Kn=k) (λm)k,\nnoted first in [21]. Second, it is well known that\na probability mass function can be reconstructed from\nthe derivatives of its associated probability generating\nfunction; we exploit this idea in Section V. Note that the\ninterpretation of the average noise as the probability gen-\nerating function of the aggregate waiting time is not spe-\ncific to swap ASAP repeater chains. This was first noted\nin [21], where they investigated several different methods\nof entanglement distributions for repeater chains. It\nwould be of interest to see similar tools exploited for\nfurther variants of entanglement distribution.\nTo derive an analytical expression of E[Λn] =Hn, it\nwill be convenient to define\nHt\nn=\u00121−q\nq\u0013nX\nts.t.\ntn=t\u0010\nqPn\ni=1ti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni=1|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n.\n(3.4)\nThis is convenient since\nHt\nn=1−q\nq∞X\nt′=1qtλ|t−t′|Ht′\nn−1.(3.5)\nThat is, we can write Ht\nnin terms of Ht\nn−1, which in\nturn can be written in terms of Ht\nn−2, etc. The approach\nis as follows: start with Ht\n1=\u0010\n1−q\nq\u0011\nqt(since there is\nonlyonelink, thereisonlythe qterm), andthencalculate\nHt\nnrecursively using Eq.

Finally, we use that\nHn=∞X\nt=1Ht\nn (3.6)\nto calculate the expectation value of the noise parameter\nΛnfornsegments.\nThe recursion takes a particular simple form; we show\nin Appendix C that for n≥1,Ht\nnis always a linear\ncombination of terms of the form qatλbt, where a, b∈Z.\nWecanthusthinkof Ht\nnasbeinganelementofthevector\nspace Vconsistingofallformal(real)linearcombinations\nof elements of the form qatλbt. \nentofthevector\nspace Vconsistingofallformal(real)linearcombinations\nof elements of the form qatλbt.

Instead of reporting them here, we provide\nall of our analytical expressions in Mathematica files [25].\n1. Analytics for the global cut-off policy\nLet denote the average of Λnwith a global cut-off\nparameter of TcbyE[Λn(Tc)]. To calculate E[Λn(Tc)],\nwe sum over all instances that satisfy the global cut-off\nconstraint, divided by the probability that the constraint\nis satisfied. That is, we calculate\nE[Λn(Tc)]\n=\u00121−q\nq(1−qTc)\u0013nX\nts.t.\nmax( t)≤Tc\u0010\nqPn\niti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n≡¯Hn.\nAsbefore, wedefine ¯Ht\nnsimilarlytothenocut-offcase,\ni.e.\n¯Ht\nn=\u00121−q\nq(1−qTc)\u0013nX\nts.t.\ntn=t\nti≤Tc\u0010\nqPn\niti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n.\nNow, Eqs.

That is, the\nmaps ¯Ht\nn7→¯Ht\nn+1and ¯Ht\nn7→¯Hnare best thought of\nas a linear map and as a linear form, allowing for the\nanalytical determination of E[Λn(Tc)].\nFor the derivations in the Appendices we drop the\u0010\n1−q\nq\u0011n\nterm, i.e. we define the quantity\nZn=X\nt\u0010\nqPn\niti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n.(3.9)\nNot only does this simplify some of the calculations,\nbut the Zncan also be interpreted as the partition\nfunction of the so-called solid-on-solid model [30–33].\nOut[ ]=\nSecret-key ratep=0.01p=0.02p=0.03p=0.04p=0.05\n50 100 150 \nled solid-on-solid model [30–33].\nOut[ ]=\nSecret-key ratep=0.01p=0.02p=0.03p=0.04p=0.05\n50 100 150 2000.0000.0020.0040.0060.008\nCut-offFIG. 3: Secret-key rate with a global cut-off policy as a\nfunction of the cut-off parameter.

(3.7) starts at max(1 , t−Tc), greatly complicating\nits calculation.\nB. Parameter exploration\nThe secret-key rate is the rate at which one can gener-\nate secret bits between two parties. It is a convenient\nmetric with a clear operational interpretation, which\nrelies on both the (average) quality of the state and\nthe (average) delivery time. In this section, we explore\nthe effect that the cut-off has on the secret-key rate\nfor several different experimental settings. Appendix D\ncontains the details for the calculations of the secret-key\nrate. We note that for up to 8 repeater segments, the\nworkfrom[21]includesanextensivenumericalanalysisof\nthe secret-key rate for a wide range of parameter regimes,\nwhere they also go beyond the paradigm of a swap ASAP\nrepeater chain.\nWe start by fixing n= 5segments and a decoherence\nparameter of λ= 0.998. In Fig. 3 we vary the success\nprobability pand the cut-off. We find that for high\nsuccess probabilities (i.e. p= 0.04andp= 0.05), the\ncut-off brings a modest increase (where the case of no\ncut-off corresponds to the cut-off going to infinity). For\nsuccess probabilities smaller than p= 0.03we find that\na cut-off is already necessary to be able to generate any\namount of secret key [11, 12]. We see that optimizing\nthe cut-off is vital for maximizing the secret-key rate —\nsomething that our calculation methods now allow for.\n is vital for maximizing the secret-key rate —\nsomething that our calculation methods now allow for.\nInFig.4weshowhowsuchanoptimizationcanbeused\nfor parameter exploration.

GENERATING FUNCTION APPROACH\nThemethodsfromtheprevioussectionprovidearecipe\ntocalculate,atleastinprinciple,ananalyticalformofthe\naverage noise. However, the expressions grow unwieldy\nvery fast, seemingly without any structure to them [21].\nThus, while the recursive calculation allows for an exact,\nquantitative understanding of the noise in swap ASAP\nrepeater chains, it does not directly yield a qualitative\nunderstanding.\nIn this section we show one method of overcoming\nthis—the so-called generating function approach (not to\nbe confused with the probability generating function).\nWhat is more, this approach also yields a computation-\nally faster method to calculate the analytical formulae\nfoundwithpreviousmethods. Wewillfirstoutlinewhata\ngenerating function is, and how it aids the understanding\nof noise in repeater chains. Afterwards, we investigate\nthe found approximations, and use it for parameter\nexplorations in repeater chains.\nA. Outline of the approach\nGenerating functions are the main object of study in\nanalytic combinatorics [34, 35]. For our setting, the\nassociated generating function has the form\nG=G(x, λ, q ) =∞X\nn=1E[Λn]xn,(4.1)whe\nr our setting, the\nassociated generating function has the form\nG=G(x, λ, q ) =∞X\nn=1E[Λn]xn,(4.1)where xcan take complex values. The goal is to first\nfind a closed-form expression G. Given such a closed-\nform expression, it is possible to extract complex analytic\nbehavior about G. In turn, this analytic behavior of\nGplaces strong constraints on the growth of E[Λn].\nIn particular, for fixed λandq,Gis a meromorphic\nfunctionin x, anditisthesingularityclosesttotheorigin\n(specifically its location and residue) that dictates the\ngrowth of E[Λn].\nAt this point, a remark is in order. It is not clear\nwhether a nice closed-form expression for Gshould\nexist, especially since we have argued that the individual\ncoefficients E[Λn]become unwieldy. This is, however,\na powerful feature of generating functions — generating\nfunctionsoftenbehavemuchbetterthantheircoefficients\nconsidered individually [34, 35]. This well-behavedness is\nnot only what allows us to extract information about the\nindividual coefficients, but also allows us to find Gin the\nfirst place.\nUsing the recursive formulation from the previous\nsection, we show in Appendix E that\nG=x·Φ1+x2 \n(1−q)2λ\n(λ−q) (1−λq)!\nΦ2·Φ4\n1−x·Φ3,(4.2)\nwhere the Φi= Φ i(x) = Φ i(x, λ, q )are particular\ninstances of so-called q-hypergeometric series [36], and\nare functions of x,λandq(see Eqs. (E49) to (E54) for a\nfull description). Since the Φiare all entire functions in\nxfor fixed λ, q(with λ̸=q), the only singularity arises\nwhen 1−x·Φ3= 0. Although understanding analytical\nsolutionstoequationsinvolving( q-)hypergeometricseries\nis generally a difficult endeavor [37, 38], it is straight-\nforward to find solutions numerically. Let ρbe the\nsmallest real solution to 1−x·Φ3= 0. Using standard\nresults from analytic combinatorics (see, for example, the\ntwo principles of coefficient asymptotics in Chapter IV\nfrom [34]) we find that\nE[Λn]∼[−Resρ(G)]·\u00121\nρ\u0013n+1\n=\" \n(1−q)2λρ\n(λ−q) (1−λq)!\n·\u0012Φ2(ρ)·Φ4(ρ)\nΦ3(ρ) +ρ·Φ′\n3(ρ)\u0013#\n·\u00121\nρ\u0013n\n≡[A(λ, q)]·B(λ, q)n, (4.3\n\nρ\u0013n+1\n=\" \n(1−q)2λρ\n(λ−q) (1−λq)!\n·\u0012Φ2(ρ)·Φ4(ρ)\nΦ3(ρ) +ρ·Φ′\n3(ρ)\u0013#\n·\u00121\nρ\u0013n\n≡[A(λ, q)]·B(λ, q)n, (4.3)\nwhere Res ρ(f)is the residue of a function fatρand the\n∼means that the ratio between the two sides converges\nto1asn→ ∞. The first equality follows from the fact\nthat Res ρ(f/g) =f(ρ)\ng′(ρ)when f, gare holomorphic on a\ndisk containing ρ, and ρis a simple zero of g.\nThe approximation in Eq. (4.3) has a clear conceptual\ninterpretation — the quality of the state decays expo-\nnentially in the number of segments n, where the decay\nfactor is given by B(λ, q)for each added segment. The\nA(λ, q)term, on the other hand, can be thought of as a\ncorrectionterm. Notethatbothtermsareindependentof8\nq=0.3,λ=0.98q=0.8,λ=0.98q=0.3,λ=0.9q=0.8,λ=0.9\n0 2 4 6 8 10n10-1310-1110-910-710-50.001Difference\nFIG. 5: Difference between the approximation of\nEq. (4.3) and the exact average noise parameter E[Λn]\nas a function of n, for four different sets of parameters.\nn. In the following subsection we numerically show that\nthis approximation is not only tight in the asymptotic\nlimit; it is already good enough for practical purposes for\nsmall n.\nIt is possible to approximate E[Λn]by including more\nthan just the singularity closest to the origin, leading to\na sum of exponential terms [34]. In practice, we find that\ntaking the first singularity suffices.\nAll of the above generalizes straightforwardly to the\ncase of a global cut-off, where there exist analogous\nfunctions A(λ, q, T c)andB(λ, q, T c)as well — see Ap-\npendices E and E3 for the derivation of the associated\ngenerating function.\nWe conclude this subsection with two remarks. First,\nwith the generating function Gin hand, it is easier\nto find analytical expressions of E[Λn]than with the\nrecursive relation from Section III. This allows us to\nanalytically calculate E[Λ25]in a matter of seconds with\nMathematica —something that was impossible with the\nrecursive approach [25]. Second, we note that the func-\ntionGis amultivariate generating function \ne\nrecursive approach [25]. Second, we note that the func-\ntionGis amultivariate generating function [35], where\nthe associated combinatorial object can be interpreted\nas a type of lattice path L. The associated parameters\nq,λandx\u0010\n1−q\nq\u0011\ncount the area A(L)under the path,\nthe roughness K(L)and the width n(L)of the path,\nrespectively. This result may be of independent interest\nto combinatorialists.\nB. Parameter exploration\nIn this subsection we will first explore the approxima-\ntion found in Eq. (4.3), before using it to understand how\nλandqaffect E[Λn]qualitatively.\nFig. 5 shows the difference between the exact average\nnoise and Eq. (4.3) for four sets of values of λandq. We\nfind that Eq. (4.3) gives an approximation that converges\nexponentially fast, independent of the parameters used.\nFrom Eq. (4.3) and Fig. 5 we find that E[Λn]decays\nOut[ ]=\n0.7800.8600.9400.995FIG. 6: Several slices of the B(λ, q, T c)function for\nTc= 2,6,10. The B(λ, q, T c)is a proxy for the decay\nrate of the quality of the state as additional segments\nget added.\nexponentially in the number of segments. In particular,\nB(λ, q)can be thought of as a decay parameter —\nevery additional segment added reduces the average Λ\nparameter by a factor of B(λ, q). The decay parameter\nthus allows us to assign a metric to a given repeater\nchain for a fixed λandq,independent of the number of\nsegments .\nAs we show in Appendix E3, a similar approximation\nworks for the global cut-off as well. That is, we find a\nsimilardecayparameter B(λ, q, T c), andanalyzeinFig.6\nhowB(λ, q, T c)varies as a function of λandq, for three\nvalues of the cut-off, Tc= 2,6and10. We find that the\nfound tight approximation allows for a fast qualitative\nunderstanding of noise in swap ASAP repeater chains,\nwhichwouldhavebeenimpossiblethroughaMonteCarlo\nsimulation.\nV. DISTRIBUTION OF THE NOISE\nIn this section we will show that knowing E[Λn]\nis, in principle, enough to reconstruct the underlying\nprobability distribution of the Λnparameter. W\ns, in principle, enough to reconstruct the underlying\nprobability distribution of the Λnparameter. We then\napply our results to a so-called ‘binning’ approach to\nquantum key distribution.\nA. Derivation\nWe will use here the found analytical forms of E[Λn]to\nfind the actual distribution of the noise. As noted before\nin the paper and in [21], the key insight is that E[Λn]is\nthe probability generating function (not to be confused\nwith the generating function from the previous section)9\nof the random variable corresponding to the roughness\nK. That is,\nE[Λn] =\u00121−q\nq\u0013nX\nt\u0010\nqPn\niti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n=∞X\nk=0P(K=k)λk\n=X\nk=0P\u0000\nΛn=λk\u0001\nλk.\nFrom this it follows that\nk!·P\u0000\nΛn=λk\u0001\n=\u0010\nE[λn](k)\u0011\f\f\f\nλ=0.(5.1)\nHereE[Λn](k)is the k’th derivative of E[Λn], which is\nunderstood to be with respect to λ. Using Mathematica,\nP\u0000\nΛn=λk\u0001\ncan be calculated analytically for all kfor\nup to n= 10segments [25].\nIn Fig. 7, we validate our analytical results by using\na Monte Carlo simulation. That is, we compare the\nexact distribution P(K=k)of the roughness for 6\nsegments and q= 0.6, and compare it with an estimate\nof the distribution from a Monte Carlo simulation over\n105timesteps. We already see excellent agreement, and\nwe find convergence to the analytical distribution as we\nincrease the number of runs. One interesting feature is\nthe ‘non-smooth’ behavior of P(K=k)(e.g. P(K=\n6)≥P(K= 7), but P(K= 7)≤P(K= 8)) which\nbecomes more pronounced for larger p.\nOut[ ]=\nProbability\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 240.000.020.040.060.080.10\nRoughness\nFIG. 7: Verification of the analytical distribution of the\nroughness K=Pn−1\ni=1|ti−ti+1|forq= 0.6andn= 6\nsegments (blue markers), along with an estimation\nfound through a Monte Carlo simulation over 105runs\n(green bars). The Monte Carlo simulation converges to\nthe exact distribution as the number of runs increases.\nUsing that P(K=k) = P(Λn=λk), we show in\nFig. 8 the distribution of Λnforp= 0.1andλ= 0.995fornranging from 2to10.

Parameter exploration\nAs an application of the analytical expressions of the\ndistribution on Λn, we consider secret key generation\nwith a so-called binning method; see, for example, [39,\n40]. That is, the collected classical data are separated\ninto ‘bins’ according to the available information about\nthe associated generated state. Here, this available in-\nformation would contain the roughness parameter K(t),\nwhich describes the quality of the state Note that the\ndata need not be received at the time of measurement,\nwhich would have come at the cost of increased decoher-\nence.\nHow does this binning help? Let SKF (Λ)be the\nsecret-key fraction, i.e. the fraction of bits that can\nbe extracted from an asymptotic number of copies of\na state with parameter Λ(see Appendix D for more\ninformation). Without binning, the secret-key fraction\nis given by SKF (E[Λ]). With binning, the secret-key\nfraction becomes the weighted average. That is,\n∞X\nk=0P(Λ = λk)·SKF\u0000\nλk\u0001\n(5.2)\n=kmaxX\nk=0P(Λ = λk)·SKF\u0000\nλk\u0001\n≥SKF (E[Λ]),10\nwhereinthefirststepweusedthatthesecret-keyfraction\nis zero for Λ≤Λmin≈0.778, such that kmax =l\nlog(Λ min)\nlog(λ)m\n. In the second step, we used that the secret-\nkey fraction is convex as a function of Λ.\nOut[ ]=\nSecret-key rate2 links4 links6 links8 links10 links\n100 200 300 40010-40.0010.0100.100\nDistance(km)\nFIG. 9: Secret-key rate with (solid) and without\n(dashed) a binning strategy (see main text) as a\nfunction of the distance, for several number of segments\nnandλ= 0.99.\nFig. 9 shows the secret-key rate both with and without\nthe binning method as a function of the \n.99.\nFig. 9 shows the secret-key rate both with and without\nthe binning method as a function of the distance.

DISCUSSION\nIn this work we have characterized the noise in homo-\ngeneousswapASAPrepeaterchains. Wehavedonesoby\nproviding analytical formulae and tight approximations\nof the average fidelity (even when considering a global\ncut-off) along with the complete distribution of the noise,\nfor a general class of noise models. The numerical\nevaluation of the formulae goes beyond existing work\nand reaches 25 repeater segments if one is interested in\nthe average fidelity of the end-to-end link only, and to\n10 repeater segments for a full characterization of the\nnoise distribution. Since near-term quantum repeaterexperiments will most likely be based on swapping as\nsoon as possible together with a cut-off policy, these\nresults yield an understanding of what to expect for near-\nterm networks. In particular, the optimization of the\nglobal cut-off (which would once be a costly Monte Carlo\nsimulation) can now be done efficiently.\nDue to the flexibility of the generating function ap-\nproach, we anticipate that similar techniques as used\nhere can be applied to other entanglement distribution\nproblems, such as in [41].\nIn follow-up work, we investigate both the inhomoge-\nneous bipartite setting and the inhomogeneous multipar-\ntite setting. This follow-up work hinges on interpreting\nEq. (3.9) as the (classical) partition function of a partic-\nular physical system — the solid-on-solid model [30–33].\nBy then exploiting techniques from statistical physics,\nwe find numerically tight approximations on the average\nnoise.\nThere are still two open questions. First, is there\na way to extend the generating \ne average\nnoise.\nThere are still two open questions. First, is there\na way to extend the generating function approach to\nincorporate the additional noise on Alice’s and Bob’s\nmemories? Using Jensen’s inequality, one can provide a\nlower bound, but an analytical solution seems currently\nout of reach. Secondly, there are also other swapping\nschemes and cut-off policies besides the global cut-off\nthat are amenable to an analytical approach, as have\nbeen treated for QKD in [21]. It would be of both\nquantum and combinatorial interest to find associated\ngenerating functions that capture Alice’s and Bob’s noise\nand/or the other cut-off policies.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Guus Avis, Patrick Emonts, Filip Rozpędek,\nMatthew Skrzypczyk, and Gayane Vardoyan for discus-\nsions.

A cut-off policy is a condition\nfor discarding the present entanglement. Discarding the generated entanglement will reduce the rate at which\nentanglement is delivered, but will mitigate the time spent on distributing end-to-end entanglement which is of\ntoo low quality. A cut-off policy thus allows for a trade-off between the rate and the quality of the delivered end-to-\nend entanglement. Cut-off policies and their trade-offs have been studied in for example [11–15, 21–23], where they\nwere shown to be indispensable for near-term devices.\nThelocal cut-off policy limits the time a single memory is allowed to store entanglement for. As soon as a memory\nnot belonging to Alice or Bob holds entanglement, a timer is started. As before, this timer increases by 1every round,\nand is reset to 0after discarding. A reset occurs when any timer exceeds Tc, where we use the same notation for the\nglobal and local cut-off. In Fig. 10 we show an example of the local cut-off. Here, the left memory of the fourth link\nhad to store entanglement for more than Tc= 2rounds.\nLocalTime\nTct1= 3\nt2=\nmemory of the fourth link\nhad to store entanglement for more than Tc= 2rounds.\nLocalTime\nTct1= 3\nt2= 2t3= 4\nt4= 1t5= 2\nFIG. 10: Graphical description of the local cut-off policy. Each node has agreed on a parameter Tc. For the local\ncut-off, a reset is performed when any node has to store entanglement for more than Tcrounds. We consider the\nlocal cut-off in follow-up work.\nThe policy considered in [20] is similar to the global cut-off policy in this paper. However, instead of starting a\ntimer at the beginning of all attempts, a timer is started at the time the first link succeeds. Another policy would be\nbased on predicting the delivery time (see [42]) and quality of the delivered state, conditioned on the current state of\nthe repeater chain [42]. Note that allentanglement is reset after a cut-off condition has been reached in the policy13\nof [20] and both the global and local cut-off.\nWe have numerically observed through Monte Carlo simulations that the local cut-off performs slightly better than\nthe global cut-off, but not by a significant amount.\nAppendix B: Generalization to X-symmetric qudit Pauli noise\nOur analysis in the main text is based on the depolarizing channel as noise model for memory decoherence (see\nSection II). There were two key features of this noise model that made it amenable for analysis:\n1.The key parameter multiplies when composing two noise channels. The depolarizing noise model from Section II\nis parameterized by two values: the probability of preserving the state perfectly (i.e. λ) and the probability of\ntransforming the state into the maximally mixed state. Due to normalization, this last probability is just 1−λ.\nApplyinganoisemapwithagiven λnoisecorrespondstothetransformations λ→λ·λnoiseand1−λ→1−λ·λnoise.\nThe fact that the first map corresponds to multiplication was a key part of our analysis.\n2.The key parameter multiplies when performing the entanglement swap. Next, we used the fact that performing\na swap between two states described \ng the entanglement swap. Next, we used the fact that performing\na swap between two states described by noise parameters λandλ′, respectively, leads to a new state with noise\nparameter λ·λ′.\nIn this Appendix, we will consider the more general scenario where the nodes hold two- quditentangled states. We\nwill show for a large class of qudit channels that we call X-symmetric channels, how to find a parameterization into\nparameters ⃗λsuchthatthetwoabovepropertiesstillhold. Tobeprecise,an X-symmetricchannel Nisad-dimensional\nqudit Pauli channel (definition below in Section B1) for which pXaZb=pX−aZbfor all a, b∈ {0,1, . . . , d −1}. We will\ngive a procedure how to find a parameterization N=N⃗λinto at most d2parameters ⃗λ= (λ1, λ2, . . . , λ dn), such that\nboth composition (item 1 below) and entanglement swapping (item 2) are represented by pointwise multiplication of\nthe entries of ⃗λ:\n1. for any two ⃗λ,⃗λ′, we have N⃗λ◦ N⃗λ′=N⃗λ·⃗λ′.\n2. let ψd=|ψd⟩⟨ψd|be a maximally-entangled states on two d-dimensional qudits. Then for any two ⃗λ,⃗λ′, an\nentanglement swap on states (I⊗ N ⃗λ) [ψ]and(I⊗ N ⃗λ′) [ψd]yields the state (I⊗ N ⃗λ·⃗λ′) [ψd].\nwhere ⃗λ·⃗λ′= (λ1λ′\n1, . . . , λ d2λ′\nd2)represents entrywise multiplication and Iis the d-dimensional qudit identity channel.\nConsequently, the analysis in the main text is straightforwardly extendible to qudit links as long as the noise model\nis an X-symmetric channel. The X-symmetric channels form a subset of qudit Pauli channels, and include (biased)\ndepolarizing noise as well as anyqubit Pauli channel (i.e. Pauli channels for d= 2).\nIn what follows we first recall the definition of qudit Pauli channels. We then study composition of qudit Pauli\nchannels, and show that qudit Pauli channels admit a parameterization so that channel composition is represented by\nmultiplication of the parameters. Finally, we investigate how maximally entangled states that have undergone qudit\nPauli channels are transformed under swap operations. From the latte\ntates that have undergone qudit\nPauli channels are transformed under swap operations. From the latter, we infer that in general, the entanglement\nswap is not represented by parameter multiplication, but for X-symmetric channels, it is.\n1. Qudit Pauli channels\nA qudit Pauli channel is any channel Ncorresponding to a probabilistic mixture of operators from the set U=\n{XaZb}d−1\na,b=0[43], i.e.\nN(·) =X\nU∈UpUU(·). (B1)\nHere 0≤a≤d−1,0≤b≤d−1[43], and XandZare generalized Pauli operators defined by their action on the\nstandard basis of Cd,\nX|j⟩=|j+ 1 mod d⟩, (B2)\nZ|j⟩=ωj|j⟩, (B3)14\nwhere ω=e2πi\nd[44].\nNote that XaZbandXkZlcommute up to a phase. Since ABA†=\u0000\neiθA\u0001\nB\u0000\neiθA\u0001†for any angle θ∈[0,2π),\nwe have that\u0000\nXaZb\u0001\u0000\nXkZl\u0001\nρ\u0000\u0000\nXaZb\u0001\u0000\nXkZl\u0001\u0001†=\u0000\nXkZl\u0001\u0000\nXaZb\u0001\nρ\u0000\u0000\nXkZl\u0001\u0000\nXaZb\u0001\u0001†; qudit Pauli channels\ncommute. Now equip the set Uwith a group structure, where the group operation is given by matrix multiplication\nbut where phases are ignored. Formally, this is the group ⟨X, Z⟩.\n⟨ωI⟩, of which {XaZb}d−1\na,b=0forms a transversal of\nthe underlying equivalence relation. This group is isomorphic to Cd×Cd, the direct product of the cyclic group of\norder dwith itself.\n2. Mapping composition of qudit Pauli channels to multiplication\nWe first investigate the composition of two qudit Pauli channels, where in particular we are interested in reducing\nthe composition to multiplication of real numbers, i.e. the analogues of the λparameter for qubit depolarizing noise.\nThe composition of two channels N1,N2with distributions pU≡f(U)andpU≡g(U), respectively, can be written as\n(N2◦ N1) [·] =X\nU∈Ug(U)U\"X\nV∈Uf(V)V[·]#\n(B4)\n=X\nW∈U X\nUV=Wg(U)f(V)!\nW[·]. (B5)\nWe recognize eq. (B5) as a convolution over finite Abelian groups1. The Fourier transform of a function h:G →C,\nwhere Gis a finite Abelian group, is defined as the function ˆh:ˆG →Csuch that\nˆh(χ) =X\nU∈Gh(U)χ(U)∗.\nThe inverse Fourier transform is given by\nh(U) =1\n|G|X\nχ∈ˆGˆh(χ)χ(U). (B6)\nHere, the χare also called the (unitary) characters of G, i.e.\nn by\nh(U) =1\n|G|X\nχ∈ˆGˆh(χ)χ(U). (B6)\nHere, the χare also called the (unitary) characters of G, i.e. the distinct homomorphisms from Gto the group of unit\ncomplex numbers T={z∈C| |z|= 1}. That is, the set of all functions χ:G → Tsuch that χ(U)χ(V) =χ(UV).\nWe denoted by ˆGthe set of all characters of G.\nThe procedure to find the desired parameterization now is as follows. First, we recall that the coefficients of the\nchannel are specified through the noise coefficient map f, defined as f(U) =pU, where Uis an element of the\nphaseless qudit Pauli group U. The first step is to compute the Fourier transform of f. The second step to determine\nthe characters χofU. These are the same as the characters of Cd×Cd, to which the phaseless Pauli group Uis\nisomorphic; in turn, we can derive the characters of Cd×Cdfrom the characters of Cd[46]. Finally, we evaluate\nthe Fourier transform ˆfat the characters χ. We will choose the resulting ˆf(χ)as our new parameters λ1, λ2, . . ., as\nconvolution of two functions becomes pointwise multiplication of their Fourier transforms [47, 48].\nAs special case, we consider d= 2, i.e. we consider an arbitrary qubit Pauli channel. In that case, Uis isomorphic\ntoC2×C2(also known as the Klein four-group), which has characters\nχ1(I) = 1 , χ1(X) = 1 , χ1(Y) = 1 , χ1(Z) = 1 ,\nχ2(I) = 1 , χ2(X) = 1 , χ2(Y) =−1, χ2(Z) =−1,\nχ3(I) = 1 , χ3(X) =−1, χ3(Y) = 1 , χ3(Z) =−1,\nχ4(I) = 1 , χ4(X) =−1, χ4(Y) =−1, χ4(Z) = 1 .\n1Fourier transforms over groups have been applied to quantuminformation before, e.g. in randomized benchmarking [45].15\nFrom normalization of the probability, we see that λ1is always equal to 1. The remaining parameters are\nλ2=pI+pX−pY−pZ, (B7)\nλ3=pI−pX+pY−pZ, (B8)\nλ4=pI−pX−pY+pZ (B9)\nwhich is indeed the parameterization given in the main text in Section II.\nLet us specialize to the case of depolarizing noise, where pX=pY=pZ=1−pI\n3. We then see that λ2=λ3=λ4=\npI−1−pI\n3=4pI−1\n3=4F−1\n3, which we see is the original λtreated in the main text.\n3. Swa\nt λ2=λ3=λ4=\npI−1−pI\n3=4pI−1\n3=4F−1\n3, which we see is the original λtreated in the main text.\n3. Swapping of states\nLet|ψd⟩ ≡1√\ndPd−1\ni=0|ii⟩be a qudit maximally entangled state and set |ψd⟩⟨ψd| ≡ψd. Let Nbe a qudit Pauli\nchannel acting on one-half of a qudit maximally entangled state. We will first show that the side the channel acts on\nis immaterial (i.e. I⊗N[ψd] =N ⊗I[ψd]) ifNisX-symmetric (which we define shortly). Thus even if X-symmetric\nnoise has acted on both sides of |ψd⟩, we are free to pretend there is one qudit Pauli channel Nacting on an arbitrary\nside, yielding a state I⊗ N[ψd] =N ⊗I[ψd]≡ρN. Secondly, we will show that swapping two states ρN1, ρN2yields\na state ρ(N1◦N2).\na. Transpose trick for Xsymmetric channels\nThe well-known transpose trick [49] states that if Ais any square matrix (of the appropriate size), the following\nholds\nI⊗A|ψd⟩=AT⊗I|ψd⟩. (B10)\nHere ATis the transpose of Awith respect to the basis {|i⟩}d−1\ni=1. Applying the transpose trick to I⊗ N[ψd]yields\nI⊗ N[ψd] =d−1X\na,b=0pXaZb\u0000\nI⊗XaZb\u0001\n[ψ] (B11)\n=d−1X\na,b=0pXaZb\u0010\u0000\nXaZb\u0001T⊗I\u0011\n[ψ] (B12)\n=d−1X\na,b=0pXaZb\u0000\nX−aZb⊗I\u0001\n[ψ], (B13)\nwhere we used that\u0000\nXaZb\u0001T=ZbX−a, which is equal to X−aZbup to a phase.\nThe above implies that the side a qudit Pauli channel is applied to is immaterial if and only if pXaZb=pX−aZb.\nThis means that the condition holds when the probability of applying XaZbis equal to the probability of applying\nX−aZb. This property holds for several relevant classes of channels, such as arbitrary qubit Pauli channels, arbitrary\nqudit dephasing noise (since the probability of applying XaZbis zero when a̸= 0) and qudit depolarizing noise.\nb. Swapping of X-symmetric noisy states\nIn the previous section we have shown that we have the freedom to move X-symmetric channels from one side of\nthe maximally entangled state to the other. With this tool in hand, let us perform a swap on two such noisy states,\nsee Fig. 11. In a) we show the complete procedure of swapping, including the measurement an\n states,\nsee Fig. 11. In a) we show the complete procedure of swapping, including the measurement and classical correction.\nWe have assumed without loss of generality that the channels N1andN2act on the qudits on which the Bell state\nmeasurement (green triangle) is performed. After the Bell state measurement, a classical outcome kis recorded, and16\na)\n|ψd⟩\n|ψd⟩N1\nN2\nU†\nkkb)\n|ψd⟩\n|ψd⟩N1\nN2 U†\nkkc)\n|ψd⟩\n|ψd⟩N1\nN2U†\nkk\nd)\n|ψd⟩N1\nN2 Uk U†\nke)\n|ψd⟩N1\nN2f)\n|ψd⟩\nN1N2\nFIG. 11: Graphical description of the proof of the desired properties of X-symmetric channels. From a) to b) we use\nthe transpose trick to show that the side on which the noise is applied is immaterial. From b) to c) we use that the\napplication of the noise and the Bell state measurement commute. From c) to d) we performed the projection into\none of the (generalized) Bell states. From d) to e) we use the commutativity of qudit Pauli operators (up to a\nphase). From e) to f) we use the transpose trick again to move the noise all to one side.\nis used to specify which correction U†\nkneeds to be performed on one of the sides after measuring. Note that the\ncorrections U†\nkare generalized Pauli operators.\nIn step b) we use the result from the previous section that we are free to move X-symmetric channels to the other\nside. In step c), we commute the Bell state measurement and the channels, which is allowed since the operations act\non different qubits. In step d) we use that measuring outcome kprojects the state unto I⊗Uk|ψd⟩. From d) to e)\nwe use that the qudit Pauli operators commute (up to an immaterial phase), and finally we use that X-symmetric\nchannels can be moved freely between the two sides.\nWe close with one final remark. The average values for the λiparameters can be interpreted as the λiparameters of\nthe average channel acting on the entangled state shared between Alice and Bob. This is because convex combinations\nof qudit Pauli channels map exactly to convex combinations of the ⃗λ, since the Fourier trans\nations\nof qudit Pauli channels map exactly to convex combinations of the ⃗λ, since the Fourier transform is linear.\nAppendix C: Recursion calculations\nHere we provide the details for the recursive calculation for the analytics of the average noise parameter.\n1. Recursion calculation without a cut-off policy\nAs discussed in Section III, calculating the average Λnparameter requires us first to express Ht\nnrecursively, from\nwhich Hn≡E[Λn]can be found. The main idea is to express the map from Ht\nntoHt\nn+1in terms of a linear\ntransformation on the real vector space spanned by qatλbt, a, b∈Z. That is, all finite linear combinations of the formP\nmca,bqatλbt, where ca,b∈R.\nAs a warm-up, let us consider the first recursion step. Here and in what follows, we will drop the1−q\nqprefactor,\ni.e. we set\nZn=X\nt\u0010\nqPn\ni=1ti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni=1|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n(C1)\nZt\nn=X\nts.t.\ntn=t\u0010\nqPn\ni=1ti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni=1|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n, (C2)17\nsuch that Hn=\u0010\n1−q\nq\u0011n\nZn.

(C8)\nNote that the limit as qgoes to λand the limit of qgoes1\nλexists. Observe that we end up with a linear combination\nof terms of the form qatλbt.

The map Mdefined for an\narbitrary |a, b⟩is, in fact, a linear map from VtoV, and so works for all expressions that are sums of terms of the\nform qatλbt.\nThis allows us to calculate Zt\nnfast. Setting qatλbt≡ |a, b⟩, the map Mtakes|a, b⟩toCa,b|a+ 1, b⟩+Da,b|1,1⟩. As\nsuch, we find that\nZt\n1=|1,0⟩ (C14)\nM− →Zt\n2=C1,0|2,0⟩+D1,0|1,1⟩ (C15)\nM− →Zt\n3=C1,0\u0000\nC2,0|3,0⟩+D2,0|1,1⟩\u0001\n+D1,0\u0000\nC1,1|2,1⟩+D1,1|1,1⟩\u0001\n(C16)\n=C1,0C2,0|3,0⟩+D1,0C1,1|2,1⟩+\u0000\nC1,0D2,0+D1,0D1,1\u0001\n|1,1⟩. (C17)\nThis already gives us a method to fairly straightforwardly compute Zt\nn, especially when done on a computer.18\nFinally, we need to extract Zt\nnfrom Zn.

In the\nfollowing we discuss how to calculate the secret-key fraction, how to determine the average delivery time when using\na global cut-off policy, and finally an upper and lower bound to the average delivery time.\n1. Secret-key fraction\nThe secret-key rate is defined as the ratio between the secret-key fraction and the average delivery time. The\nsecret-key fraction is the ratio between the number of secret bits that can be extracted and the number of measured19\nstates. The secret-key fraction depends on the used protocol. Here we consider fully asymmetric BB84 [1, 11, 12, 50].\nThe ‘BB84’ refers to the original quantum key distribution protocol [1], where both parties measure in two bases\n(XandZ). The ‘fully asymmetric’ refers to the fact that only in a vanishingly small subset of cases either of the\ntwo parties measures in X. Furthermore, we will also assume that we run the protocol for an asymptotic number of\nrounds, such that finite-size effects can be ignored.\nFor fully asymmetric BB84, the secret-key fraction can be expressed in terms of Λas follows [50],\nSKF (Λ) = max\u0012\n0,1−2·H\u00121−Λ\n2\u0013\u0013\n, (D1)\nwhere H(p) =−plog2(p)−(1−p) log2(1−p). (D2)\n2. Expected delivery time\nCalculating the secret-key rate above, in Section D1, includes the expected delivery time. Without a cut-off, this\nis given by\nE[max ( T1, T2, . . . , T n)] =nX\nk=1\u0012n\nk\u0013(−1)k+1\n1−(1−p)k, (D3)\nsee [22, 51].\nFor the cut-off case, we first define an ‘attempt’ as the consecutive collection of rounds in which entanglement\ngeneration was attempted before a success or a reset. In the presence of a global cut-off, the expected delivery time\nis the sum of two terms: the time that the protocol has spent in attempts that were eventually restarted because the\nc\nterms: the time that the protocol has spent in attempts that were eventually restarted because the\ncut-off was met, and the time until successful entanglement generation in the final attempt, which occurred before\nthe cut-off time.\nFor the first term, we note that the expected number of resets is1\nPsucc−1, where Psucc=\u0000\n1−(1−p)Tc\u0001nis the\nprobability that the cut-off is not reached in a single attempt and Tcthe cut-off time. Since every time a reset is\nenforced Tcrounds have been performed, the first term equals\u0010\n1\nPsucc−1\u0011\nTc,\nThe second term is the expectation value of the delivery time, conditioned on the fact that entanglement generation\nsucceeds before Tc:\nTcX\ntmax=1tmax·\u0012f(tmax)\n(1−(1−p)Tc)n\u0013\n(D4)\nwhere\nf(tmax) =\u0010\n1−(1−p)tmax\u0011n\n−\u0010\n1−(1−p)tmax−1\u0011n\nis the probability that an attempt succeeds exactly at timestep tmax, and the denominator\u0000\n1−(1−p)Tc\u0001nis the\nprobability that entanglement generation succeeds before Tc.\nCombining the two terms, we find that the expected delivery time in the presence of a cut-off Tcis given by\n\u00121\n(1−(1−p)Tc)n−1\u0013\nTc+TcX\ntmax=1tmax·\u0012f(tmax)\n(1−(1−p)Tc)n\u0013\n. (D5)\nAppendix E: Derivation of the generating function\nWe will show here the derivation of the function discussed in Section IV, i.e. a closed-form expression for\nG≡∞X\nn=1E[Λn]xn. (E1)20\nIt will turn out to be more convenient to consider the sum\nG=∞X\nn=1Znxn, (E2)\nwhere Zn=X\nt\u0010\nqPn\ni=1ti\u0011\n·\u0010\nλPn−1\ni=1|ti−ti+1|\u0011\n. (E3)\nHere, truns over all length- nsequences of strictly positive integers, i.e. all possible combinations of times at which\na link is generated over the nrepeater segments individually. Since E[Λn] =\u0010\n1−q\nq\u0011n\nZn, we have that\nG(x) =G\u0012\nx\u00121−q\nq\u0013\u0013\n. (E4)\nThat is, by replacing xwith x\u0010\n1−q\nq\u0011\ninGwe retrieve G, the function of interest.\nBefore continuing, let us make a few technical remarks. In analytic combinatorics, combinatorial classes are studied\nthrough the analytical properties of their associated generating function. A combinatorial class can be thought of as\na countable c\nes of their associated generating function. A combinatorial class can be thought of as\na countable collection of objects such that the number of objects with a given ‘size’ nis finite. However, the number\nof allowed tof a fixed length nis infinite when no cut-off is considered. Fortunately, the analytical and combinatorical\ntools that we employ remain valid. Furthermore, the function Gis technically a multivariate generating function [35],\nsince the sum has not only a variable x(corresponding to the number of entries nint), but also two auxiliary variables\nqandλ. Finally, a key idea of analytic combinatorics is to treat generating functions as formal power series, ignoring\nissues of convergence. This can be justified rigorously; see, for example, [34].\nIn what follows, we first find an expression of Gin terms of so-called q-hypergeometric series, after which we find a\nsimilar expression for the case of a global cut-off, corresponding to restricting the sum in Eq. (E3) to those tsatisfying\nmax( t)≤Tc.\n1. No cut-off\nWe now give a high-level overview of the proof. First, we will use the recursive relation found in Section C that\nrelates Zt\nntoZt\nn+1. This relation can be thought of as a linear map on the vector space spanned by basis vectors of\nthe form |a, b⟩ ≡qatλbtto itself. Using the well-known correspondence between linear maps and unnormalized Markov\nchains, the calculation of Zt\nncan be formulated in terms of walks of length n−1on an unnormalized Markov chain.\nThe possible walks on the Markov chain can be split into two disjoint types. The first type is easy to characterize;\nthe second type is more involved. In particular, the second type is the composition of three separate subwalks, the\nsecond of which can repeat an arbitrarily large number of times before moving to the third subwalk. The composition\nof subwalks is most naturally understood in terms of generating functions. That is, the product of the generating\nfunctions corresponding to the three aforementio\ng functions. That is, the product of the generating\nfunctions corresponding to the three aforementioned subwalks keeps track of the relevant data for the second type, as\nwe shall see.\nLet us start the proof by recalling the recursive relation from Section C. As before, setting qatλbt≡ |a, b⟩, we have\nZt\n1=|1,0⟩. Each subsequent Zt\nncan be found by repeatedly applying the linear map M, which is defined on the basis\nvectors by |a, b⟩M− →Ca,b|a+ 1, b⟩+Da,b|1,1⟩, with\nCa,b=−qaλb\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\n(1−λb−1qa) (1−λb+1qa), (E5)\nDa,b=qa\nλ1−b−qa. (E6)\nWith the above approach, we found in Sec. C, Eq. (C17) for example that\nZt\n1=|1,0⟩ (E7)\nM− →Zt\n2=C1,0|2,0⟩+D1,0|1,1⟩ (E8)\nM− →Zt\n3=C1,0\u0000\nC2,0|3,0⟩+D2,0|1,1⟩\u0001\n+D1,0\u0000\nC1,1|2,1⟩+D1,1|1,1⟩\u0001\n(E9)\n=C1,0C2,0|3,0⟩+D1,0C1,1|2,1⟩+\u0000\nC1,0D2,0+D1,0D1,1\u0001\n|1,1⟩. (E10)21\nAn approach to determine Zt\nnorZnwould correspond to understanding each of the allowed terms |a′, b′⟩and their\nassociated weights, e.g. the weight of |1,1⟩after two applications of Mis given by C1,0D2,0+D1,0D1,1. We can think\nof the repeated application of Mas summing each of the possible walks that one can take in the Markov chain below,\nsee Fig. 12. For each step, an additional multiplicative factor of Ca,borDa,bis incurred. After n−1steps (i.e. n−1\napplications of M), there will be a number of walks that end up at a given |a′, b′⟩. The sum of the total weight of\neach walk that ends up at a given |a′, b′⟩after n−1steps is exactly the coefficient (i.e. the weight) corresponding to\n|a′, b′⟩, when expanding Zt\nnin the basis {|a, b⟩}a,b.\n|1,0⟩|2,0⟩|3,0⟩···\n|1,1⟩|2,1⟩|3,1⟩···\nC1,0C2,0C3,0\nD1,0D2,0D3,0\nC1,1C2,1C3,1\nD1,1D2,1D3,1\nFIG. 12: An unnormalized Markov chain with transition ‘probabilities’ given by the Ca,bandDa,b. The starting\npoint is |1,0⟩. There are two types of finite walks, those that stay in the left branch (corresponding to b= 0), and\nthose that transition to the right branch at a certain point. The second type can be decomposed into three parts—a\nwalk staying in the left branc\na certain point. The second type can be decomposed into three parts—a\nwalk staying in the left branch, then any number of ascents followed by a transition back to |1,1⟩, and finally one\nmore ascent.\nThus, doing this for each possible |a′, b′⟩allows us to retrieve the full Zt\nn. At first sight, this seems like a hopeless\ntask—it would require not only understanding the possible walks from |1,0⟩to|a′, b′⟩(for each a′, b′) inn−1steps,\nbut also keeping track of the associated weights. Fortunately, such problems can be dealt with using a generating\nfunction approach, as we will show in the following. For an extensive overview on generating functions see [34].\nNote that the above Markov chain has two distinct ‘branches’ — one with b= 0and one with b= 1. First, we\ndeal with the case of b= 0. The only walk that ends in the b= 0branch is the one that stays in it for each of the\nn−1steps, corresponding to multiplying by Ca,bfor each of the n−1steps. This is because after taking a step\ncorresponding to the Da,bcoefficient, the bparameter will remain equal to 1.\nThe case for b= 1is a bit more complicated. Any possible such walk decomposes into three distinct subwalks.\nThe first subwalk stays in the b= 0branch for a number of steps before moving to the b= 1branch. The second\nsubwalk consists of an arbitrary number of ‘loops’ in the b= 1branch. A ‘loop’ here corresponds to starting from\n|1,1⟩, ‘ascending’ to some |a′,1⟩, and dropping down to |1,1⟩again. Finally, there will be a final ascent to some |a′,1⟩.\nThe final ascent is considered separately, since the weight associated to |a′,1⟩will acquire a multiplicative factor of\n1−qa′λ\nqa′λ, due to the linear form taking Zt\nntoZn, see Eqs. (C17) and (C19).\nThe above characterization of the walks allows us to reduce the calculation of Gto the calculation of the generating\nfunctions of the above walks. In other words, we have that\nG=G0→end+Gb=1 (E11)\n=G0→end+G0→1·Gseq\n1→1·G1→end. (E12)\nHere G0→1is the generating function corresponding t\nd+Gb=1 (E11)\n=G0→end+G0→1·Gseq\n1→1·G1→end. (E12)\nHere G0→1is the generating function corresponding to staying in the b= 0branch, while Gb=1is the generating\nfunction for walks ending up in the b= 1branch. Furthermore, G0→1is the generating function for walks starting in\ntheb= 0branch ending with a transition to the b= 1branch, Gseq\n1→1is the generating function of all possible walks22\nstarting and ending at |1,1⟩, and G1→endthe generating function of all ascents starting at |1,1⟩(including the term\ncorresponding to the linear form). In the first line we used that the generating function of two disjoint sets is the\nsum of the generating functions. In the second line we used the simple but powerful fact that the generating function\nof the Cartesian product of two classes equals the product of the generating functions of the two classes [34]. The\nlast statement can be seen as follows. Let there be two walks of two different types, where aiandbjare the weights\nassociated to walks of length iandjfor the two types, respectively. Summing the product of the weights over every\npossible path of total length nyieldsPn\nk=0akbn−k. The claim then follows since\n ∞X\nn=0anxn! ∞X\nn=0bnxn!\n=∞X\nn=0cnxn(E13)\nwhere cn=nX\nk=0akbn−k. (E14)\nNow, it remains to determine the generating functions G0→end,G0→1,Gseq\n1→1andG1→end. First, we consider the\nG1case. The transition from |1,0⟩to|2,0⟩corresponds to a weight of C1,0. Similarly, the transition from |2,0⟩to\n|3,0⟩corresponds to a weight of C2,0. This yields a total contribution of C1,0C2,0— exactly the term in front of the\n|3,0⟩term in Eq. (E10). Generalizing, a single ascent from |1,0⟩to|m+ 1,0⟩acquires a weight of\nxm+1mY\na=1Ca,0=xm+1mY\na=1 \n−qa\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\n\u0000\n1−1\nλqa\u0001\n(1−λqa)!\n(E15)\n=xn+1n−1Y\na=0 \n−qaq\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\n\u0000\n1−q\nλqa\u0001\n(1−(λq)qa)!\n(E16)\n=x(−1)nq(n\n2)\u0002\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\nqx\u0003n\n\u0000q\nλ;q\u0001\nn(λq;q)n. (E17)\nwhere (a;q)m≡Qm−1\ni=0(1−aqi)is the q-Pochhammer symbol [36]. The xterm keeps track of the corresponding\nnumber of segments in the repeater chain.\nFurthermore, du\nThe xterm keeps track of the corresponding\nnumber of segments in the repeater chain.\nFurthermore, due to the linear form taking Zt\nntoZn(see Eq. (C18)), each weight corresponding to |m+ 1,0⟩also\nacquires a multiplicative factor ofqm+1\n1−qm+1, leading to a total weight of\nx(−1)mq(m\n2)\u0002\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\nqx\u0003m\n\u0000q\nλ;q\u0001\nm(λq;q)m·qm+1\n1−qm+1(E18)\n=qx(−1)mq(m\n2)\u0002\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\nq2x\u0003m\n\u0000q\nλ;q\u0001\nm(λq;q)m·1\n1−qm+1(E19)\n=qx\n1−q(−1)mq(m\n2)(q;q)m·\u0002\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\nq2x\u0003m\n\u0000q\nλ;q\u0001\nm(λq;q)m(q2;q)m(E20)\n=qx\n1−q(−1)mq(m\n2)(q;q)m(q;q)m·\u0002\u00001\nλ−λ\u0001\nq2x\u0003m\n(q;q)m\u0000q\nλ;q\u0001\nm(λq;q)m(q2;q)m. (E21)\nIn the first step we took the expression from Eq. (E17) and multiplied by the term acquired from the linear map,\ni.e.qm+1\n1−qm+1. In the second step we pulled the numerator ofqm+1\n1−qm+1into the first part. In the third line we use that\n1\n1−aqm+1=(aq;q)m\n(1−aq) (aq2;q)m. (E22)\nIn the final step we multiply by(q;q)m\n(q;q)m, which will turn out to be convenient in the next step.\nThe expression in Eq. (E21) corresponds to the weight of |m+ 1,0⟩.

E25, motivating the introduction of the term(q;q)m\n(q;q)min Eq. (E21).\nWe now move on to the b= 1case. As mentioned above, any possible walk that ends in the b= 1branch consists\nof three possible subwalks, see Eq. (E12).

Cut-off case\nThe goal of this section is to find the generating function for the case of a global cut-off. The construction is the\nsame as the case without a cut-off. That is, the recurrence relation can be mapped unto a Markov chain, and the\ngenerating function can be recovered by splitting the possible walks into different subwalks (and finding the generating\nfunctions of those subwalks). In this section we will only discuss the splitting into subwalks—the determination of\nthe individual generating functions is similar to the previous section. As such, we do not report these calculations\nhere and instead refer to our Mathematica code [25].\nInthecaseofacut-off, theli\nt these calculations\nhere and instead refer to our Mathematica code [25].\nInthecaseofacut-off, thelinearmaptaking Zt\nntoZt\nnisdefinedby |a, b⟩M− →Ca,b|a+ 1, b⟩+Da,b|1,1⟩+Ea,b|1,−1⟩,\nwith Ca,b,Da,bas before, and\nEa,b=−qa(tc+1)λ1+tc+b(1+tc)\n1−qaλb+1, (E55)\nsee Section C2. This map can also be seen in terms of an unnormalized Markov chain, where there are now three\nbranches, b= 0,1,−1, see Fig. 13. This case is more complicated, since a walk might now alternate between the\nb=−1andb= 1branch. In what follows, we list all possible subwalks. We change notation slightly; for a generating\nfunction of the form Gy\nx,xrefers to the start of the subwalk, while yrefers to the end of the subwalk. Furthermore,\ninstead of referring to the branches by their bparameter, we will use the convention that the b= 0,1,−1branches\ncorrespond to c= 0,1,2, respectively. Finally, we will drop the overline notation, with the understanding that the\ndistinction between the generating functions with and without the replacement x7→x1−q\nq(1−qTc)of is clear.\nAs before, a walk might stay in the c= 0branch, corresponding to the Gend\n0generating function. On the other\nhand, a walk might stay in the c= 0branch for some time, before moving to the c= 1orc= 2branch, corresponding\ntoG1\n0andG2\n0, respectively. Let us focus on the walks that first go to the c= 1branch and also finish there. As before,\nthe walk can stay for an arbitrary number of attempts in the c= 1branch before falling back to |1,1⟩. A single such\n‘loop’ is described by a generating function G1\n1, such that an arbitrary sequence of such ‘loops’ is given by1\n1−G1\n1.\nSince the walk needs to end in the c= 1branch, it needs to transition back and forth between the c= 1andc= 2\nbranches several times (including potentially zero times). Let us consider the case where it transitions only once to\nthec= 2branch. The transition itself is captured by some generating function G2\n1. As with the c= 1branch, the\nwalk can stay in the c= 2branch for a number of\nenerating function G2\n1. As with the c= 1branch, the\nwalk can stay in the c= 2branch for a number of ‘loops’, corresponding to1\n1−G2\n2. Afterwards, the walk transitions\nback to the c= 1branch with associated generating function G1\n2. Up to this point, the generating function of a walk\nthat transitions once back and forth between the c= 1andc= 2branch is given by\nG1\n0·\u0012G2\n1\n1−G1\n1·G1\n2\n1−G2\n2\u0013\n.

The starting\npoint is |1,0⟩. There are now several different types of walks, explained in the main text.\nThe transition from c= 1toc= 2and back can now happen an arbitrary number of times, leading to the following,\nG1\n0·1\n1−\u0010\nG2\n1\n1−G1\n1·G1\n2\n1−G2\n2\u0011. (E57)\nFinally, the walk will have an arbitrary number of loops in the c= 1branch, before having one final ascent,\nG1\n0·1\n1−\u0010\nG2\n1\n1−G1\n1·G1\n2\n1−G2\n2\u0011·1\n1−G1\n1·Gend\n1. (E58)\nIn a similar fashion, the generating functions for the walk starting and finishing at c= 2is given by\nG2\n0·1\n1−\u0010\nG1\n2\n1−G2\n2·G2\n1\n1−G1\n1\u0011·1\n1−G2\n2·Gend\n2. (E59)\nLet us now consider the walk that starts at c= 1and ends at c= 2. Note that we can think of this as a path\nthat is very similar to a path that starts and ends at c= 1. That is, instead of finishing in the c= 1branch after\noscillating between the c= 1andc= 2branch, there is a transition between to the c= 2branch. Finally, there will\nbe a number of ‘loops’ and one last ascent in the c= 2branch. This yields\nG1\n0·1\n1−\u0010\nG2\n1\n1−G1\n1·G1\n2\n1−G2\n2\u0011·1\n1−G1\n1·G2\n1·1\n1−G2\n2·Gend\n2.

Our project is aimed at introducing MBQC to a wide\naudience ranging from high school students to quantum computing researchers through a Tangram\npuzzle with a modi\fed set of rules, played on an applet. The rules can be understood without any\nbackground in quantum computing. The player is provided a quantum circuit, shown using gates\nfrom a universal gate set, which the player must map correctly to a playing board using polyomi-\nnos. Polyominos, or `puzzle blocks' are the building blocks of our game. They consist of square tiles\njoined edge-to-edge to form di\u000Berent colored shapes. Each tile represents a single-qubit measurement\nbasis, di\u000Berentiated by its color. Polyominos rest on a square-grid playing board, which signi\fes\na cluster state. We show that mapping a quantum circuit to MBQC is equivalent to arranging\na set of polyominos|each corresponding to a gate in the circuit|on the playing board|subject\nto certain rules, which involve rotating and deforming polyominos. We state the rules in simple\nterms with no reference to quantum computing. The player has to place polyominos on the playing\nboard conforming to the rules. Any correct solution creates a valid realization of the quantum\ncircuit in MBQC. A higher-scoring correct solution \flls up less space on the board, resulting in a\nlower-overhead embedding of the circuit in MBQC, an open and a challenging research problem.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe circ\nbedding of the circuit in MBQC, an open and a challenging research problem.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe circuit model of quantum computing is the most\nwidely studied method to implement a quantum com-\nputer. In this model, a set of universal quantum gates\nis used to implement a quantum algorithm. A set of\nnqubits, prepared in a product state, undergo unitary\noperations (or quntum gates). At the end of the cir-\ncuit, each qubit is measured o\u000B, collapsing the entangled\nstate of nqubits, to one of the 2nstates in the super-\nposition, thereby revealing the answer to the computa-\ntion. The algorithm is encoded in the sequence of gates.\nGates are draws from a (small) set of universal gates.\nThis quantum circuit representation resembles a classi-\ncal (Boolean) circuit made up of universal gates (e.g., the\nNAND gate) evolving the classical state of a collection of\nnbits. As a result, the circuit model of quantum com-\nputing is very easy to understand. There are multiple\nonline courses that teach high-school and undergradu-\nate students, working professionals the basics of quantum\ncomputing using the circuit model. Measurement-Based\nQuantum Computing (MBQC) is another model of quan-\ntum computation that has recently started regaining at-\ntention, because of its promise in photonic quantum com-\nputing. However, it is not yet widely known even in the\nquantum computing community. Our project is aimed\nat introducing MBQC to a wide audience ranging from\nhigh-school students to quantum computing researchers.\nIt sets out to create a fun, open-source applet, similar to\nthe game of Tangram, through which the player learns\nto map quantum circuits to MBQC. This applet is being\n\u0003ashlesha@.arizona.edudeveloped as a Education and Workforce Development\n(EWD) initiative of the NSF ERC Center for Quantum\nNetworks (CQN) and we plan to use it for our outreach\nactivities. Moreover, high-score solutions to our game\nwill provide insights in resource e\u000Ecient compilations of\nquantum circuits into MBQC: an \no our game\nwill provide insights in resource e\u000Ecient compilations of\nquantum circuits into MBQC: an open research prob-\nlem relevant for photonic quantum computing, and dis-\ntributed quantum computing over a network.\nII. BACKGROUND\nUnlike the circuit model, where qubits are passed\nthrough gates, in the one way model of MBQC pro-\nposed in 2001, quantum computation is achieved solely\nby performing a series of adaptive single qubit measure-\nments on a highly connected entangled state called clus-\nter state [1, 2]. Cluster states form a class of entangled\nstate that can be represented graphically with nodes con-\nnected by edges (Fig. 1b) such that the nodes correspond\nto qubits prepared in j+istate and every edge represents\ncontrolled-Phase gates between the qubits at the ends\nof the edge. Cluster state used for MBQC is generated\nbefore the computation starts. Ideally, we want all mea-\nsurements on the qubits of the cluster state to result in\n+1 eigenvalues to implement the right computation. If\nthe measured eigenvalue is -1 due to the randomness of\nquantum measurements, the computation is corrected by\napplying Pauli corrections, i.e. rotating the measurement\nbasis of the following measurements. The subsequent\nmeasurements depend upon the measurement results of\nthe previous measurements. Fig. 1 shows a quantum\ncircuit on the left and on the right is the MBQC im-\nplementation of that circuit on a 3x7 2D cluster state.arXiv:2210.11465v1  [quant-ph]  20 Oct 20222\nHere, we have two types of qubits - the quantum cir-\ncuit qubits and cluster state qubits. In MBQC, each\nquantum gate on the quantum circuit qubits can be de-\ncomposed into a series of measurements on cluster state\nqubits. In Fig. 1(b), the highlighted qubits are mea-\nsured and di\u000Berent colors are for di\u000Berent measurement\nbasis. The measured cluster state qubits are highlighted\nin the same color as the quantum gate in Fig. 1(a) their\nmeasurement implements. The green highlight signi\fes\nPauli-Z basis measurement. P\nin Fig. 1(a) their\nmeasurement implements. The green highlight signi\fes\nPauli-Z basis measurement. Pauli-Z basis measurement\nremoves the measured qubit from the cluster state. It is\nessential to perform these measurements to isolate cluster\nqubits that undergo single qubit operations on di\u000Berent\nquantum circuit qubits from each other. At the end of\nthe measurements, the state of the two unmeasured clus-\nter qubits or output qubits in Fig. 1(b) should match the\nstate of qubit Q1; Q2in Fig. 1(a).\nAs seen from Fig. 1(b)-(c), translating a quantum cir-\ncuit to a series of measurements on a cluster state in\nMBQC can be seen as a tiling puzzle where a set of\nblocks are to be arranged on a lattice with the same ge-\nometry as the cluster state. For example, in the case\nof a square-grid cluster state, the measurement blocks\ntake the shape of polyominos, commonly known as puzzle\nblocks for games like Tetras. In this paper, we have de-\nsigned a tiling puzzle to map quantum circuits to MBQC\nmeasurement patterns that closely resemble the game of\nTangram. Our puzzle is slightly di\u000Berent in the sense\nthat it asks the player to replicate a quantum circuit us-\ning polyominos that signify MBQC measurement blocks\nand while arranging the polyominos the player needs to\nfollow speci\fc rules dictated by MBQC. Note that, the\nmeasurement pattern for a quantum gate is not unique,\nwhich makes our puzzle interesting and challenging. Ad-\nditionally, the player is scored based on the total area\ncovered by polyominos such that minimizing this area is\nencouraged.\nWe \frst describe the game in detail in Section III. We\nthen give the reasoning behind the game rules using the\nMBQC theory in Section IV.\nIII. QUANTUM TANGRAM\nThis section describes the game in terms of the inter-\nface and the MBQC principles translated into the rules\nthe players needs to follow while placing polyominos.\nA. The gameplay\nWhen the game starts, we give the player an interactive\ntutorial on how to create equivalent polyominos\nn the game starts, we give the player an interactive\ntutorial on how to create equivalent polyominos based on\nSection IV A. As part of the game, the player is given\na quantum circuit, an empty square-grid to add poly-\nomionos. In the current version of our game, the player\nis given only Cli\u000Bord quantum circuits. All Cli\u000Bord quan-\ntum circuit operations can be performed using only Paulibasis measurements on the cluster state. The Pauli-X, Y\nand Z basis measurements are represented as blue, orange\nand green monominos, respectively as shown in Fig. 2.\nThese monominos are used to generate every other poly-\nomino in our game. Having only three colors for the poly-\nominos keeps the game simple. Fig. 3 shows the minimal\npolyominos, i.e., the measurement blocks with least num-\nber of measurements for quantum gates for the Cli\u000Bord\ngates and the SWAP gate [1{3]. The player has in\fnite\nsupply of minimal polyominos for wires (identity gate)\n(see Fig. 4), the Cli\u000Bord gates, the SWAP gate along\nwith the monominos for the Pauli measurements. Fig. 5\nshows various stages of the game. Note that, the given\npolyominos implement the corresponding quantum gate\nmodulo some phase which comes from the probabilistic\nmeasurement outcomes. Here, we ignore that phase for\nthe sake of simplicity. The player can drag and drop, ro-\ntate the given polyominos, and append wires to deform\nthe polyominos using the rules discussed in Section III B.\nTo further simplify the game, we paint every square on\nthe grid green corresponding to Pauli-Z measurements\nto start with. When the player puts a polyomino on\nthe grid, the squares get re-colored with the colors from\nthe polyomino. This ensures that every polyomino is ap-\npropriately padded with Pauli-Z measurements and the\nplayer won't have to add the green tiles manually. We\nalso ask the player to mark the positions of the output\nqubits. This is required to evaluate their submission as\ndiscussed in Section IV B. While evaluating the submis-\nsion, we \frst che\naluate their submission as\ndiscussed in Section IV B. While evaluating the submis-\nsion, we \frst check for correctness and score the correct\nsolutions that consume lesser area higher. If the player\nreplicates the quantum circuit, they move on to the next\nmore di\u000Ecult level.\nB. Game rules\nIn this section, we describe the game rules as they\nwould appear in the actual game, designed such that\nno prior knowledge of quantum information is required\nto understand them. We refer to polyominos as puzzle\nblocks and the monominoes (squares) of a polyomino as\ntiles in this section. The goal is to implement the given\nquantum circuit while minimizing the area occupied by\nthe non-green tiles.\nRule 1: Start reading the given quantum circuit from\nleft to right. Each gate in the quantum circuit corre-\nsponds to a puzzle block given to you. You can drag and\ndrop the puzzle blocks for the gates onto the game-board\narea to implement the quantum circuit.\nRule 2: A puzzle block can be deformed or its shape can\nbe modi\fed without changing its function, if every tile in\nthe new modi\fed puzzle block has the same non-green\ntile neighborhood has the original block.\nRule 3: All puzzle blocks have `In' and `Out' tiles\nmarked on them. The numbers of In- and Out-tiles of\na block are each equal to the number of qubits the cor-\nreponding quantum gate operates on. You can place the3\nFIG. 1. Every quantum gate in the quantum circuit translates to a (non-unique) measurement pattern in MBQC. (a) Quantum\ngates and (b) the corresponding measurement patterns highlighted on a square-grid cluster state using same colors as the\nquantum gates. The cluster state qubits highlighted in green represent the Pauli-Z basis measurements used to isloate single\nqubit gates. (c) An example of the Tangram puzzle constructed using polyominos.\nFIG. 2.

Multiple Out tiles\nrepresent all possible tiles that could become the Out-tile, i.e.,\nwhere the In-tile of the next polyomino can be placed.\n\frst block anywhere on the grid, in any orientation. Ev-\nery other block must be placed such that its In-tile(s)\nfalls on top of the the out-tile(s) of the previous blocks.\nAny two puzzle blocks can touch each other only at the\nIn-Out tiles.\nRule 4: The position of the In-tile(s) is \fxed for a puzzle\nblock. But the player can choose the location of the\nOut-tile. The Out-tile(s) can be assigned to any empty\n(green) neighboring tile of the last colored tile of the block\nFIG. 4. Identity or \\wire\" operation which deforms a poly-\nomino without changing its operation. The two types of wires\n(a)-(b) blue, and (c)-(d) orange.

The In-\nand (all possible) Out tiles are marked.\nas long as the assigned Out-tile doesn't touch any other\ntile(s) of the block. This rule is a special case of Rule 2.\nRule 5: A puzzle block can be rotated by pressing the\nspace bar when it is selected. Rotations don't a\u000Bect the\npuzzle block's function as long as Rule 3 and 4 are obeyed\nwhile placing the block.\nRule 6: A wire is a special kind of puzzle block. It\ncan be added before the In-tile and after the Out-tile as\nper Rule 3. However, unlike other blocks, it can also\nbe inserted in a puzzle block. This changes the shape\nof the puzzle block while keeping its function the same.\nHowever, the wire can be inserted only after any tile of\nthe puzzle block that has at most two neighbors. The\nwire should sit between two previously neighboring tiles\nof the block. Wires can be added to each other to create\nlonger wires.\nRule 7: Once you have implemented the given quantum\ncircuit, mark the output qubits in the correct numbering,\ni.e.\nou have implemented the given quantum\ncircuit, mark the output qubits in the correct numbering,\ni.e., the numbering of the output qubits on the game-4\nboard should matching the numbering of the qubits in\nthe quantum circuit.\nIV. THEORY\nIn this section, we discuss the minimal polyomnimos,\nand manipulation of the shape and size of the minimal\npolyominos to create equivalent measurement patterns\nusing the rules of MBQC. We then explain how we eval-\nuate the player's solution using stabilizer formalism.\nA. Quantum circuit to MBQC\nTime \rows from left to right in a quantum circuit.\nThe computation moves in the same direction as time.\nHowever, in MBQC, time and hence, computation can\nprogress in any direction on the cluster state. It can also\nchange the direction between di\u000Berent operations. Hence,\none can start the computation by measuring any arbi-\ntrary qubit of the cluster state i.e., in the game, the \frst\ntile can be placed anywhere on the game-board. Chang-\ning the shape of a polyomino while keeping the neighbor-\nhood of all its tiles the same only changes the direction\nof computation, as the function of a polyomino depends\nupon the relative positions of its tiles. And every poly-\nomino for a quantum gate has In and Out tiles to de\fne\nthe direction of computation.\nThe quantum circuit qubits are assumed to be in the\nj+istate at the beginning of the computation. In MBQC,\nthis state is mimicked at a qubit of the cluster state by\nmeasuring all its neighbors in Pauli-Z basis. Pauli-Z mea-\nsurements on a cluster state delete the measured qubits\nfrom the state. As a result, it is easy to see that the clus-\nter state qubit is left in the j+istate if all of its neighbors\nare measured in Pauli-Z basis. Subsequently, a quantum\ngate on the qubit j+iin the quantum circuit is imple-\nmented by adding the polyomino for that gate. The state\nof the cluster state qubit at the Out tile is same as that\nof the quantum circuit qubit, given that the polyomino is\npadded by Pauli-Z measuremen\n same as that\nof the quantum circuit qubit, given that the polyomino is\npadded by Pauli-Z measurements. These measurements\nunentangle the Out-tile qubit from the rest of the cluster\nstate. They prevent a polymomino from interacting with\nothers in undesired directions. Now, the next quantum\ngate in the quantum circuit is implemented by placing\nthe In-tile of the next polyomino at the current Out-tile.\nAnd rotating a polyomino only changes the direction of\nthe computation as long as the In-tiles are overlapped\nwith the Out-tiles of the previous polyomino(s). Note\nthat, it is because of the In-Out tiles that the polyomi-\nnos for CNOT and the blue wire are di\u000Berent, while the\nremaining part is structurally identical. Whenever two\npolyominos touch each other at non-In/Out tiles, it cre-\nates a new measurement pattern or polyomino altogether,\nwhose function is completely di\u000Berent from the two con-\nstituting polyominos.There can be multiple possible options for Out tiles\nfor each polyomino based on the number of unoccupied\nneighboring tiles of the penultimate tile as shown in Fig. 3\nand 4. The Out tile cannot touch two or more tiles of\nthe polyomino it's part of, otherwise. It needs to have\nexactly one\nThe shape and the size of a polyomino can be changed\nwith the help of \\wires\" or the Identity gate. The Iden-\ntity operation can be performed by measuring either two\nconsecutive cluster qubits in the Pauli-X basis (a blue\ndomino), three consecutive cluster qubits Pauli-Y basis\n(orange tromino), or a combination of the two as shown\nin Fig. 4(a)-(b). We refer to this operation as \\wire\"\nas the quantum circuit qubit remains unchanged after\nit. Rotating (Fig. 4(c)) or deforming (Fig. 4(d)) a wire\nalso results in identity as discussed earlier. Fig. 6(a)) and\nFig. 7 show multiple equivalent polyominos created using\nwires for the Hadamard and CNOT operation.\nB. The back-end\nIn this section, we discuss how the evaluation of the\nplayer's solution is done. There are mainly two-types\no\nection, we discuss how the evaluation of the\nplayer's solution is done. There are mainly two-types\nof outputs we calculate - output of the quantum circuit\ngiven to the player and the MBQC pattern the player\nhas come up with. As Pauli basis measurements are suf-\n\fcient to implement all Cli\u000Bord quantum circuits, we use\nthe stabilizer formalism [4, 5] to evaluate the Cli\u000Bord uni-\ntaries and the Pauli measurements in the quantum circuit\nand the MBQC implementation, respectively. Once we\nhave the output stabilizers of both the quantum circuit\nand the MBQC pattern, we \frst remove redundant Pauli\noperators from the stabilizer generators using an algo-\nrithm similar to the row-reduced echelon form (RREF)\nalgorithm in [6]. We then compare the circuit stabiliz-\ners with the stabilizers of the qubits that the player has\nmarked as output qubits. The player has implemented\nthe given quantum circuit if the stabilizers match. All\nsteps for implementation of the backend including the al-\ngorithm to reduce the stabilizer generators are discussed\nin Appendix 1.\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\nIn conclusion, we have created a game to teach the user\nMBQC through a Tangram-like puzzle. Optimal compi-\nlation of MBQC measurement pattern is an open research\nproblem. We hope that in addition to being an e\u000Bective\noutreach tool, this game can give us some insights into\ntackling the MBQC compilation problem. As next steps,\nwe are working on incorporating non-Pauli basis mea-\nsurements that are required for non-Cli\u000Bord operations.\nWe also plan to use di\u000Berent lattice topologies such as\nhexagonal or triangular to increase the di\u000Eculty of the\ngame in higher levels.5\n(a)\n (b)\n(c)\n (d)\nFIG. 5.

Minimal CNOT and when appended with wires\nAppendix A: Implementation\nWe use the algorithms discussed in [4, 5] to simulate\nCli\u000Bord gates and Pauli measured on a classical com-\nputer. These algorithms are designed for tableau encod-\ning of stabilizers. As discussed in Section IV B, there\nare two parts to evaluating whether the user has im-\nplemented the given quantum circuit or not. First, we\nneed to calculate the output of the given quantum cir-\ncuit. This is achieved using the following steps if the\ngiven circuit is a Cli\u000Bord circuit -\n1. For a circuit with n-qubits, initialize qubits in j+i\nstate. The stabilizer generators for these qubits are\n-fX1; X2; : : : ; X ngand the corresponding tableau\nis -\nTQ=\u00120n\u0002nIn\u0002n0n\u00021\nIn\u0002n0n\u0002n0n\u00021\u0013\n2. Modify the tableau for every gate in the quantum\ncircuit going left to right. Let TQFbe the output\ntableau at the end of the quantum circuit.\nWe then evaluate the output \n right. Let TQFbe the output\ntableau at the end of the quantum circuit.\nWe then evaluate the output of the user-implemented\nmeasurement pattern on the square grid. This square-\ngrid represents a cluster state. Its stabilizer generators\nareXiQ\njN(i)Zj, for all qubits iin the cluster state and\nqubits in the neighborhood of i,N(i). Let TMbe the\ntableau of the stabilizer generators of the square grid\ncluster state. The user will have marked noutput qubits\ncorresponding to the qubits of the quantum circuit in\ntheir solution. These qubits remain unmeasured. We\ncalculate the tableau TMF, tableau after performing mea-\nsurements that correspond to the player's solution, and\nthe Pauli-Z measurements on the remaining grid on TM.\nWe then reduce TMFusing the algorithm discussed in\nAppendix B. We then calculate the 2 n\u00022nsub-matrix\nofTMFcorresponding to the nmarked output qubits\nand compare it with TQF. If they match, the user hasimplemented the measurement pattern that mimics the\ngiven quantum circuit. We then calculate the fraction of\nthe square grid area that is covered by the measurement\nblock and assign a score to the user such that the solution\nthat minimizes the \flled area is rewarded.\nAppendix B: Reduction of tableau\nAlgorithm 1 Reduction of the stabilizer tableau\nInput: Tableau Tof an n-qubit stabilizer state\nOutput: Modi\fed tableau Tsuch that its every generator\nhas the smallest support\n1:R # of rows in T\n2:n R=2\n3:r 1\n4:while r\u0014ndo\n5: forc 1 tondo\n6: Sx T[r+n::2n][1::n]\n7: xc allisuch that Sx[i][c] = 1\n8: ifxcis not null then\n9: swap r-th and ( xc[1] + r\u00001)-th rows of T\n10: swap ( r+n)-th and ( xc[1] +r\u00001 +n)-th rows\nofT\n11: form 1 tondo\n12: ifT[m+n][c] = 1 and ( m6=r)then\n13: T = rowsum(T,m+n,r+n) .De\fned\nbelow\n14: T = rowsum(T,r,m) .To ensure the\nstabilizer and destabilizer commutation relations hold\n15: end if\n16: end for\n17: end if\n18: r r+ 1\n19: end for\n20:end while\n21:forr 1 tondo\n22: Sx T[r+n][1::n]\n23: ifSxis a zero array then\n24: Sz T[r+n][n+ 1::2n]\n25: form 1\n\n21:forr 1 tondo\n22: Sx T[r+n][1::n]\n23: ifSxis a zero array then\n24: Sz T[r+n][n+ 1::2n]\n25: form 1 tondo\n26: a allisuch that Sz[i] = 1\n27: Tmn=T[m+n][n+ 1::2n]\n28: b allisuch that Tmn[i] = 1\n29: ifais a subset of bandm! =rthen\n30: T=rowsum (T; r; m )\n31: T=rowsum (T; m +n; r+n);\n32: end if\n33: end for\n34: end if\n35:end for\nrowsum(h, k) : There are two parts to this sub-\nroutine.

The cavities are fabricated using quasi -\nisotropic etching and feature experimentally measured quality factors as high as  ~11,000. \nWe investigate the dependence of a single SnV center’s emission by controlling the cavity \nwavelength using a laser -induced gas desorption technique. Under resonance conditions, we \nobserve an intensity enhancement of the SnV emission by a factor o f 12 and a 16 -fold \nreduction of the SnV lifetime. Based on the large enhancement of the SnV emission rate \ninside the cavity, we estimate the Purcell factor for the SnV zero -phonon line to be 37 and \nthe coupling efficiency of the SnV center to the cavity, t he β factor, to be 95%. Our work \npaves the way for the realization of quantum photonic devices and systems based on efficient \nphotonic interfaces using the SnV color center in diamond.    \n  \n 2 \n     Color centers in diamond are promising solid state quantum em itters, of interest for realization \nof single photon sources [1] and quantum memories leveraging their long -lived spins [2]. The \nnitrogen -vacancy (NV) center, the most intensi\nemories leveraging their long -lived spins [2]. The \nnitrogen -vacancy (NV) center, the most intensively investigated among diamond color centers, \nhas been used in quantum network demonstrations, including photon -mediated remote \nentanglement of distinct NV centers [3] and deterministic delivery of entanglement between nodes \nof a quantum network [4,5] . However, NV centers have a low zero -phonon line (ZPL) emission \n(only ~3% of total emission), and tend to be unstable (blinking, spectral diffusion, etc) inside \nnanostructures, due to a high susceptibility to external electric field fluctuations from surfaces [6]. \nRecently, group -Ⅳ color centers in diamond, such as the silicon -vacancy (S iV) [7–9], germanium -\nvacancy (GeV) [10–12], and tin -vacancy (SnV) [13–15], have attracted much attention because of \ntheir stable and large ZPL emission, even inside nanostructures. While the SiV and GeV centers \nrequire operation at mK temperature [16] or under static strain [17] to suppress spin decoherence \ncaused by phonon -induced transitions between ground state levels, the SnV centers have a much \nlarger splitting between these levels (~850 GHz), an d can thus support long spin coherence times \nat 1 K [15].       \n    To take advantage of the full potential of SnV  centers, it is important to realize an efficient spin -\nphoton interface for SnV that can improve the ZPL collection efficiency and enhance the coherent \nZPL emission by resonant coupling to color centers [18–21]. This can be accomplished using \noptical micro/nanocavities with high quality ( Q) factors. Photonic crystal (PhC) nanocavities are \nparticularly promising platforms for enhancing the light -matter i nteraction, owing to their high Q \nfactors and small mode volumes ( V). In particular, 1 -dimensional (1D) nanobeam cavities have \nbeen intensively studied in diamond because they can be readily fabricated using a variety of \ntechniques, including angle etchi ng [22], diamond film thinning [23,24] , \nated using a variety of \ntechniques, including angle etchi ng [22], diamond film thinning [23,24] , and quasi -isotropic \netching [25].  Importantly, high -Q 1D nanobeam cavities coupled with SiV centers have recently \nenabled the experimental demonstration of a single photon transistor [9] and spin memory -\nenhanced quantum communication [26].  Finally, nanobeam cavities can also support high -\nfrequency (~ 10 GHz) and high -Q mechanical modes [27], which are of interest for the realization \nof spin -phonon interfaces.  \n    In this le tter, we report on optical coupling of a single SnV center to a PhC nanobeam cavity in \ndiamond. We use a quasi -isotropic undercut method to fabricate free -standing PhC nanobeam \ncavities in bulk diamond crystal, featuring Q factors as high as 11,000. Next, we select a cavity ( Q \n~ 3,000) with a good coupling to a single SnV center, introduced via ion -implantation, and tune \nthe cavity into resonance with the SnV center using a laser -induced gas desorption technique. At \nresonance, we observe a strong enhancemen t of the SnV emission intensity by a factor of 12 and \na 16-fold reduction in the SnV lifetime (compared to centers in bulk). Due to the significant \nenhancement of the spontaneous emission rate, we estimate a Purcell factor for the SnV ZPL of \n37 and a near -unity cavity coupling efficiency β (probability of emitted photons being channeled \ninto the cavity mode) of 95%. These results provide a step towards the development of quantum 3 \n information processing devices including efficient quantum light sources [23,28] , and the creation \nof spin -photon interfaces [26] using single SnV centers coupled to high -Q PhC cavities.  \n \n \nFig. 1.

(d) Selected PL spectrum of a cavity with a =188 nm, exhibiting the highest Q \nfactor among the 153 measured cavities. The r ed solid line is a fitting curve.  \n \n    We used a diamond based PhC nanobeam cavity, as schematically shown in Fig 1(a). The cavity \nstructure consists of a free -standing nanobeam waveguide with a width ( w) of 330 nm and \nthickness ( d) of 170 nm. The lattice cons tant ( a) ranges from 188 to 196 nm, and the airhole radius \n(r) is 65 nm. In order to form the cavity, the air holes are shifted near the waveguide center \nquadratically [29](a1 = 0.84 a, a2 = 0.844 a, a3 = 0.858 a, a4 = 0.88 a, a5 = 0.911 a, and a6 = 0.951 a). \nFor a = 196 nm, we obtained a high theoretical Q factor of ~6×105 and a very small mode volume \nV of ~0.42( λ/n)3 for the fundamental cavity mode by a 3D finite -difference time domain method \n(refractive index of the diamond slab is 2.4). Figure 1 (b) shows the cavity design, overlaid with \nthe calculated electric field ( Ey) distribution of the fundamental cavity mode.  \n4 \n     For the fabrication of the designed cavity in diamond, a commercially available electronic grade \nsingle -crystal diamond sample (Element Six) was etched using argon/chlorine followed by oxygen \nplasma in order to remove the surface damaged layer caused by polishing. It was then clea ned by \nimmersion into a 1:1:1 boiling tri-acid mixture of perchloric, nitric, and sulfuric acid for one \nhour[30]. Tin (117Sn) atoms were implanted with an energy of 350keV resulting into a mean ion \nrange of about 86 nm from the surface with a straggling of 17 nm, as simulated by the software \npackage “ Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter” (SRIM) [31]. The sample was divided into two \nareas and implanted with two different ion fluences of 2×1010 and\n. The sample was divided into two \nareas and implanted with two different ion fluences of 2×1010 and 1×1012 ions/cm². We employed \nthe lower implantation dose area for optical experiments using a single SnV center later. During \nthe implantation, the sample was tilted by 7° in order to avoid channeling effects. The sample was \nsubsequently tri -acid cleaned again, and then annealed at 1200℃ for approximately 5 hours to \nallow vacancies to become mobile and form SnV complexes with the implanted Sn atoms.  \n    Following another tri -acid cleaning, free -standing PhC nanobeam cavities were fabricated us ing \na combination of electron beam (EB) lithography and dry etching processes. We then deposited a \n100nm -thick SiN layer on the bulk diamond by plasma -enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The \nSiN layer is used as a hard mask for the diamond etch later. We c onducted EB lithography to write \nthe cavity structure on a 400nm -thick EB resist (ZEP -520A). After the resist development, we \netched the SiN mask layer by induced coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP -RIE) with sulfur \nhexafluoride (SF 6) and octafluorocy clobutane (C 4F8) gases. After removing the EB resist, the \ncavity pattern was transferred onto the diamond substrate by oxygen -plasma RIE. A 20nm -thick \nAl2O3 layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition for conformal coverage of the sample and \nthen etched  out by RIE, while keeping the sidewall s of the nanobeam to be covered with Al 2O3. In \norder to realize free -standing cavity structures, we employed a quasi -isotropic undercut technique \n[25] using oxygen -based RIE. We finally removed the SiN and Al 2O3 layers by immersion in \nhydrofluoric acid (HF). Figure 1 (c) shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of one \nof the fabricated nanobeam cavity.  \n    We characterized the fabricated devices using photoluminescence (PL) measurements at 4K, in \na closed -cycle cryostat (Montana Instruments). We excited the sample with a 5 20nm conti\nat 4K, in \na closed -cycle cryostat (Montana Instruments). We excited the sample with a 5 20nm continuous \nwave diode laser, and the PL signal from the sample was collected t hrough an objective lens \n(Olympus MPLFLN, 100× magnification and 0.9 NA) and analyzed by a spectrometer (Princeton \nInstruments) equipped with a Si CCD camera. Figure 1(d) shows a PL spectrum for the \nfundamental cavity mode with the highest Q factor among 1 53 measured cavities. By fitting the \nspectrum with a Lorentzian function (red line), the measured  Q was deduced to be ~11,000, which \nis comparable to that of visible -wavelength nanobeam cavities realized by quasi -isotropic etching \n[25]. \n      5 \n     Next, we investigated the optical coupling between a single SnV center and a nanobeam cavity \nwith a =196 nm. The measured Q factor of the cavity was ~ 3000. The cavity was tuned in and out \nof resonance with a single SnV ZPL transition at 624nm using the gas tuning method, discussed \nbelow. Figure 2 (a) shows the PL spectra taken under various cavity -SnV detunings. The longer \nwavelength of this SnV compared to the usual 620nm reported in other works [13,14] , is due to \nresidual strain [32], induced by the ion implantation and/or the fabrication. Unstrained SnV centers \nwere also present in cavities, but most single ones could  not be spectrally isolated. The linewidth \nof the SnV emission is below the spectral resolution limit of our spectrometer (~10GHz). Note that \nthe SnV emission in the nanobeam cavity did not exhibit any large spectral shifts over our \nspectrometer resolution  through the whole experiments, suggesting the suitability of SnV centers \nfor integration into nanophotonic structures.  For the control of the detuning between the SnV and \nthe cavity wavelength s (Δ=λSnV - λcavity), we employed a gas tuning technique based on local heating \nusing focused laser excitation [33]. After injecting the N 2 gas in the cryostat chamber, the gas \ncondenses on the cavity resultin\n[33]. After injecting the N 2 gas in the cryostat chamber, the gas \ncondenses on the cavity resulting into a red -shift of the cavity wavelength over the target SnV \nemission. Subsequently, we used high excitation powers (\u003E 1 mW) of the CW laser at 520 nm  to \nlocally heat the cavity close  to its center, which results in the desorption of the N 2 gas from the \nsample and enables a controlled blue -shift of the cavity wavelength. The magnitude of the shift \ncan be controlled by varying the laser power and excitation time. It is noteworthy that w e did not \nsee significant changes in the Q factors during the gas tuning. Figure 2 (b) and (c) show PL spectra \nunder off -resonance (Δ= -1.0 nm) and on -resonance (Δ~0 nm) conditions. When the cavity is \nresonant with the SnV emission, we observed a 12 -fold e nhancement of the SnV emission, \nsuggesting an increased spontaneous emission rate by the Purcell effect. For the estimation of the \nenhancement factor, we compared the peak area under the Lorentzian fit curves of  the SnV \nemission in the on - and off -resonanc e cases. We note that out of 32 cavities we measured, all \nfeaturing the same a and typical Q factor \u003E103, only one could be tuned on - and off -resonance with \na spectrally isolated single SnV center. This low yield  is mainly because many cavities contain \nmultiple SnV emitters with close or overlapping ZPL emissions, or the cavity -SnV wavelength \ndetuning is l arge. In order to increase the yield of devices with good SnV -cavity coupling, it may \nbe needed to employ ion implantation with lower doses and lower energies, to reduce the number \nof centers per cavity and residual strain,  as well as employ techniques wit h precise spectral and \nspatial alignment of cavities with respect to the single color centers [34].  6 \n  \nFig. 2.  (a) Color map of low -temperature (4 K) PL spectra taken when the cavity resonance is \ntuned through the SnV emission by a gas desorption process using a focused laser beam. PL \nnance is \ntuned through the SnV emission by a gas desorption process using a focused laser beam. PL \nspectrum measured under the detuning (b) Δ = -1.0 nm and (c) Δ ~ 0 nm. Red solid lines are fitting \ncurves with multiple Lorentzian peak functions.      \n  \n    We also carried out time -resolved PL measurements on the same SnV for different values of the \nSnV-cavity detuning. We excited the sample using a supercontinuum laser (SuperK EXTREME) \nwith a central wavelength of 535nm, pulse width of 100nm and a repetition rate of 9.74MHz. The \naverage d pump power was fixed to 300 μW. Spectral filtering of the SnV emission was performed \nusing a home -made monochromator.  The filtered signal was sent to an avalanche photodiode (APD, \nExcelitas SPCM) and analyzed by a single photon counting module (PicoHarp 300). The time \nresolution of our system was measured to be 600ps. Figure 3(a) shows the measured PL decay \ncurves with 5 different detuning s of Δ = 0.88nm, 0.38 nm, 0.27 nm, 0.17 nm, and ~0 nm. As \nexpected, the emission lifetime of the SnV is reduced as the  detuning becomes smaller. We fitted \nthe PL curves with one or two exponential functions convolved  with the gaussian response \nfunction with our system ’s time resolution. The extracted emission rates of the PL curves are \nplotted in Fig. 3(b), showing a clea r enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of the SnV \nnear resonance. In particular, the fastest lifetime , near zero detuning (on resonance, γon), is 0.38 ns, \nwhich is approximately 16 times faster than that measured for SnV in bulk (plotted using black \ndots in Figure 3(a)). We noticed that the PL curve at resonance also exhibits a slow decay with a \nlifetime of 4.6 ns. This slow decay component main ly originates from the bare cavity emission, \nwhich was confirmed by measuring the cavity lifetime under a far -detuned condition to be 4.4 ns.  \n    From the extracted lifetimes, we estimate the Purcell factor of the investigated ZPL ( FpZPL) \nusing th\nm the extracted lifetimes, we estimate the Purcell factor of the investigated ZPL ( FpZPL) \nusing the followi ng equation [23]; FpZPL =(γbulk / γon－γbulk / γoff) / ξZPL. Here γbulk, and γoff are the \n7 \n lifetime of SnV in bulk, and off resonance, respectively. ξZPL is defined by the fraction of the total \nemission into the stronger of the two ZPL transitions visible at 4K for SnV in bulk diamond (~ \n0.4), which i s roughly estimated by a product of the Debye –Waller factor of 57% [35] and the \nbranching ratio of approximately 70% into that transition at 4K [15]. Using γbulk = 6.0 ns, γon= 0.38 \nns, γoff = γ0.88nm = 7.4 ns, we deduced the Purcell factor to be 37. This value is still smaller than the \ntheoretical Purcell factor [36] of 362 estimated using the measured Q ~ 3,000, and V ~ 0.42 ( λ/n)3 \nand considering  the polarization mismatch between the dipole moment of the SnV transition  \n\u003C111\u003E  and the cavity local electric field  \u003C110\u003E . The reason for the reduced Purcell factor  could be \na sub -optimal position of the SnV center with respect to the antinode of the cavity electric field, \ndue to the stochastic nature of the implantation process. For further improvement of the Purcell \nfactor, the use of precise positioning techniques of color centers , [9,34,37]  as well as high Q/V \ncavit y designs [38,39]  could be necessary.  Using  the lifetimes on and off resonances, we also \nobtain a high coupling efficiency of the SnV transition to cavity mode, β = 1/γon /(1/γon +1/ γoff) = \n95%, indicating a near unity probability for emitted photons from the SnV transition to be \nchanneled into the investigated cavity mode.   \n    Finally, in order to confirm the single photon nature of the investigated SnV emission, we \nperformed second -order correlation measu rements for the SnV transition using a Hanbury Brown -\nTwiss setup equipped with two APDs. We used a laser repetition rate of 77.9MHz with an average \npump power of 2.7 mW. Figure 3 ( c) shows the intensity cor\netition rate of 77.9MHz with an average \npump power of 2.7 mW. Figure 3 ( c) shows the intensity correlation histogram measured when \nthe SnV is slightly detuned from the cavity resonance by 0.23nm (see inset). The second -order \ncorrelation function at zero delay time, g2(0), exhibits a clear antibunching with a value of 0.27, \nconfirming that the investigated SnV is a single photon emitter. We consider th at the non -zero \nvalue of g2(0) could be primarily due to the contribution of the background cavity emission [40] \nsupplied by other off -resonant SnV centers inside the cavity. In order to reduce the value of  g2(0), \nit would be necessary to use lower ion implantation doses or deterministic implantation techniques \n[9,37]  to largely reduce the SnV center density inside a single cavity. The g2(τ) histogram also \nexhibits a bunching behavior visible on the first few peaks, which suggests the existence of a \nshelving state other than the excited and ground states in the SnV [13,41] . 8 \n  \n \nFig. 3.   (a) Time resolved PL spectra measured for the SnV  under 5 different detuning conditions \nand for a SnV in bulk. The solid lines correspond to exponential fits convolved with  the system ’s \ntime resolution. (b) Extracted SnV emission rate as a function of detuning. (c) Second -order \ncorrelation g2(τ) measured  with a  SnV-cavity detuning of Δ = 0.23 nm. The i nset shows the \ncorresponding PL spectrum. All experimental data are recorded at 4 K.  \n     \n   \n9 \n     In summary, we have demonstrated optical coupling between a single SnV center and a PhC \nnanobeam cavity. Using  a cavity with a Q factor of ~3,000, we observed clear intensity \nenhancement of the SnV emission resonantly coupled to the cavity by a factor of 12 and a 16 -fold \nreduction in the SnV lifetime. Such a large enhancement of the SnV emission rate gives a Purce ll \nfactor for the ZPL of 37 and a high cavity coupling efficiency β of 95%. These results prove the \nhigh potential of SnV centers for o\ngh cavity coupling efficiency β of 95%. These results prove the \nhigh potential of SnV centers for optical coupling to photonic nanocavities, which opens the door \nfor a variety of diamond -based quantum photonic applicatio ns that require efficient and fast single \nphoton emitters coupled to nanocavities  [28]. We note that there is still room for further increase \nof the Purcell factor using cavity designs with extremely small Vs and high Qs [38,39] , as well as \nusing precise position alignment tec hniques of single emitters [9,34,37] . We also note th at the \ncollection efficiency of the enhanced single photon emission can be largely improved using tapered \nwaveguide for fiber coupling [42] and grating couplers [43]. In addition, our nanobeam design is \ncompatible with strain -mediated tuning approaches of color center transitions. The incorporation \nof these functionalities into the demonstrated SnV -nanocavity coupled system is important for the \ndevelopment of s pin-photon interfaces for future large -scale integration of color centers into  \nintegrated photonic circuits and quantum networks [44]. \nNote: During the process of finalizing this Letter, we  became aware of a related work [45]. \n  \nAcknowledgments  \nWe would like to thank Bartholomeus Machielse, Prof. Amir Yacoby, Arjun Mirani, Smarak Maity \nand Linbo  Shao for their helpful discussion.

They\ncan provide high quality entanglement distribution service to\nend-users by performing quantum operations such as entangle-\nment swapping and entanglement puriﬁcation. In this work, we\ncharacterize the capacity region of such a quantum switch under\nnoisy channel transmissions and imperfect quantum operations.\nWe express the capacity region as a function of the channel\nand network parameters (link and entanglement swap success\nprobability), entanglement puriﬁcation yield and application level\nparameters (target ﬁdelity threshold). In particular, we provide\nnecessary conditions to verify if a set of request rates belong to the\ncapacity region of the switch. We use these conditions to ﬁnd the\nmaximum achievable end-to-end user entanglement generation\nthroughput by solving a set of linear optimization problems.\nWe develop a max-weight scheduling policy and prove that the\npolicy stabilizes the switch for all feasible request arrival rates. As\nwe develop scheduling policies, we also generate new results for\ncomputing the conditional yield distribution of different classes of\npuriﬁcation protocols. From numerical experiments, we discover\nthat performing link-level entanglement puriﬁcation followed\nby entanglement swaps provides a larger capacity region than\ndoing entanglement swaps followed by end-to-end entanglement\npuriﬁcation. The conclusions obtained in this work can yield\nuseful guidelines for subsequent quantum switch designs.\nIndex Terms —Quantum Switch; Capacity Region; Entangle-\nment Puriﬁc\nbsequent quantum switch designs.\nIndex Terms —Quantum Switch; Capacity Region; Entangle-\nment Puriﬁcation; Max-weight Scheduling\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nEntanglement distribution is critical for many promising\nquantum applications such as quantum key distribution (QKD)\n[20], teleportation [16], quantum sensing [10], clock synchro-\nnisation [14], and distributed quantum computing [2]. Recent\nworks [3], [4], [18], [25] and proposals [5], [15], have given\nmuch attention to distribute entanglements in a large scale\nquantum network that supports these applications. In an entan-\nglement distribution network, a network of quantum switches\nare connected through optical ﬁber links. The switches are\nresponsible for creating entanglements with their neighbors\nand perform a quantum operation known as entanglement\nswapping on individual entanglements to create end-to-end\nuser entanglements .\nIn this work, we focus on a star shaped quantum network\nrepresented by a quantum switch and a set of Kend user\nnodes as shown in Figure 1. End users are connected to the\nswitch via a quantum communication channel. An entangle-\nment generation source located in the middle of the channel\ncreates maximally entangled bipartite Bell states ( EPR pairs )\nEnt. Purificationuser 𝒋link 𝒊user 𝟏user 𝑲user 𝒊(a)\nFigure 1: A quantum switch serving end-to-end entanglement to K\nend users.\nand sends one half of the pair to the switch and the other to\nthe end user.\nThis shared entangled state between the switch and an\nend user is known as link-level entanglement . The switch\nand each end user can generate multiple such link-level\nentanglements. Requests to create end-to-end entanglement\nbetween users arrive at the switch. The role of the switch\nis to select speciﬁc link level entanglements to consume and\nperform entanglement swapping thereby generating end-to-\nend user entanglements to satisfy the requests. The quantum\napplications at the end users can then consume these end-to-\nend entanglements or keep them at thei\n\napplications at the end users can then consume these end-to-\nend entanglements or keep them at their respective quantum\nmemories for future usage.\nRecently, there has been signiﬁcant interest in analyzing the\nperformance of a single quantum switch that serves multiple\nend users [6], [17], [22]–[24]. For example, Vardoyan et\nal. [22], [23] derived expressions for the maximum possible\nend-to-end bipartite entanglement generation rate of a quan-\ntum switch using discrete-time and continuous-time Markov\nchains. Nain et al. [17] derived closed form expressions for the\ncapacity of a switch serving multi-partite entanglements to end\nusers. They also derived the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions\nfor stability of the switch. However, these works [17], [22],\n[23] assume the creation of end-to-end entanglements in a\ncontinuous manner, i.e., once the link-level entanglements\n1arXiv:2212.01463v1  [quant-ph]  2 Dec 2022are available, they are immediately consumed to create end-\nto-end entanglements. The notion of serving entanglement\nrequests from quantum applications in an on-demand manner\nand scheduling those requests was not considered in these\nworks.\nThe request scheduling problem in a quantum switch pri-\nmarily involves determining which link-level entanglements\nshould be consumed during entanglement swapping and at\nwhat times so that respective end user entanglement requests\ncan be satisﬁed. The scheduling problem can further have\nmultiple scheduling objectives such as maximizing the ag-\ngregate entanglement generation rate or maintaining ﬁnite\nrequest backlogs there by providing ﬁnite end-user latencies.\nThe latter objective is also known as achieving stability\nfor the switch and has been investigated in [6], [24] under\ndifferent assumptions on lifetimes of link-level and end-to-\nend entanglements. In particular, Vasantam et al. [24] assumed\nentanglements to last for a single time slot and characterized\nthecapacity region of the switch. Here, the capacity region\ndescribe\ngle time slot and characterized\nthecapacity region of the switch. Here, the capacity region\ndescribe the set of end-to-end request rates that the switch can\nstably support with ﬁnite request backlogs. Similarly, Dai et\nal. [6] considered inﬁnite entanglement lifetime and proposed\nscheduling protocols that stabilize the switch.\nWhile the aforementioned works on both continuous and\nrequest based models consider channel loss and entanglement\nswap failures, they assume the channel and quantum oper-\nations to be noise-free and do not explicitly model imper-\nfections in capacity region calculations. Quantum transmis-\nsions are inherently noisy due to their interactions with the\nenvironment and generally produce non-maximally entangled\nlink-level and end-to-end entanglements. Thus, the generated\nentanglements may not be good enough for consumption at\nthe application level. In this work, we remove the noise-free\nassumption and study the problem of quantum switch schedul-\ning with noisy channels and imperfect quantum operations.\nWe associate a target entanglement ﬁdelity threshold ( Fth) for\nquantum applications where ﬁdelity is a widely used metric\nto quantify the quality of an entanglement. We consider the\nrequest for entanglement generation to be satisﬁed only when\nthe generated end-to-end entanglement has a ﬁdelity greater\nthanFth:\nDue to noise in quantum channels and devices, ﬁdelity of\nan entangled state decreases with each quantum operation.\nLetFlink andFswap denote the ﬁdelity of the link-level\nentanglement and the entangled state created after a swap\nrespectively. Typically, we have Fswap\u003C Flink\u003C1, where\nthe ﬁdelity of a perfect entangled state is considered to be\n1. WhenFswap\u003CFth, the generated user entanglements are\nnot good enough for consumption at the application level. To\ncircumvent this issue, one can perform nested entanglement\npuriﬁcation [9] on these low quality entanglements to generate\nfewer number of high quality entanglements that achieve a\ntarget ﬁdel\nlity entanglements to generate\nfewer number of high quality entanglements that achieve a\ntarget ﬁdelity.\nThe order in which entanglement puriﬁcation and en-\ntanglement swap operations are performed can lead to the\nfollowing two architectures. (i) Purify &Swap (PS): Onewhere puriﬁcation is performed on link-level entanglements,\nfollowed by entanglement swaps. (ii) Swap &Purify (SP):\nOne that performs entanglement swapping ﬁrst on link-level\nentanglements and then performs puriﬁcation on end-to-end\nentanglements. It is important to understand the trade-offs and\ndesign constraints of these architectures, which can shed some\nlight on the future design of quantum switches. To this end, we\ncharacterize and compare the capacity regions of a quantum\nswitch under both of these architectures.\nA. Contributions\nWe characterize the capacity region of a quantum entangle-\nment distribution switch under channel noise and imperfect\nquantum operations. Our contributions are summarized below.\n\u000FWe determine the capacity region of a quantum switch as\na function of the network (link &swap entanglement suc-\ncess probability, Flink), entanglement puriﬁcation (condi-\ntional yield) and application level ( Fth) parameters under\nPS and SP architectures.\n\u000FWe develop max-weight scheduling policies for both PS\nand SP architectures that stabilize the switch for all\nfeasible request arrival rates.\n\u000FWe generate new results for computing the conditional\nyield distribution of different classes of puriﬁcation pro-\ntocols.\n\u000FWe evaluate and compare the capacity regions of PS and\nSP architectures under different classes of puriﬁcation\nprotocols, channel and network parameters.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\nwe brieﬂy introduce the quantum background and the system\nmodel relevant to this work. Section III discusses some of\nthe main results related to determining the capacity region of\na switch under PS and SP architecture. Section IV presents\nresults related to deriving the c\ngion of\na switch under PS and SP architecture. Section IV presents\nresults related to deriving the conditional yield distribution\nand expected conditional yield of different classes of entan-\nglement puriﬁcation protocols. We evaluate the performance\nof puriﬁcation protocols and PS, SP architectures in Section V.\nSection VI concludes the paper and discusses some possible\nfuture work.\nII. T ECHNICAL PRELIMINARIES\nWe consider a quantum switch that creates entanglements\nbetweenKend users as shown in Figure 1. User iis connected\nto the switch via a ﬁber optic link. For brevity, we will use\nthe term “node\" to refer to both end users and the quantum\nswitch with node 0referring to the switch.\nA. Quantum Background\nWe now brieﬂy revisit some of the quantum operations\nrelevant to this work.\nQuantum Entanglement: A two qubit state is said to be\nentangled if it can not be written as a product of its individual\nqubit states. The following four entangled two qubit states are\nof particular importance.\nj\u001E\u0006\niji=j0iij0ji\u0006j1iij1jip\n2;j \u0006\niji=j0iij1ji\u0006j1iij0jip\n2;\n2Yield Dist.𝑃(𝑌|𝑋)𝑾(𝒊𝒋(𝒏)𝑻𝒊(𝒏)𝑻𝒋(𝒏)𝑻-𝒊(𝒏)𝑻-𝒋(𝒏)𝑛=0𝑛=1user 𝒊user 𝒋𝑭𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒌Nested Ent.

EPR pairs obtained after entanglement may not be\nperfect due to noise in quantum communication channels and\nquantum operations. Suppose, nodes iandjshare an imperfect\nEPR pairj\u001Biji. The d\nication channels and\nquantum operations. Suppose, nodes iandjshare an imperfect\nEPR pairj\u001Biji. The density operator \u001Aijassociated withj\u001Biji\ncan be expressed in the Bell basis as follows.\n\u001Aij=F1j\u001E+\niji h\u001E+\nijj+F2j \u0000\niji h \u0000\nijj\n+F3j +\niji h +\nijj+F4j\u001E\u0000\niji h\u001E\u0000\nijj; (1)\nwithP4\ni=1Fi= 1:Since, we are interested in state j\u001E+\niji,\nF1is the ﬁdelity of state j\u001Biji. Ideally one would want to\nachieve a unit ﬁdelity, i.e. value of F1to be equal or very\nclose to 1:But, due to non-ideal conditions, F1\u003C1:\nEntanglement Swapping [13]: Suppose end users i;jshare\nEPR pairsj\u001E+\n0ii;j\u001E+\n0jiwith the switch. Then an entangled\nstatej\u001E+\nijican be created between users iandjby taking\na Bell state measurement (BSM) on one qubit of each pair\nstored at the switch. This operation is known as entanglement\nswapping. Let Flink denote the ﬁdelity of both link level\nentanglements on which entanglement swapping is being\nperformed. Denote Fswap as the ﬁdelity of the new EPR pair\ncreated by the swap. Then, Fswap can be expressed as an\nincreasing function \u0011(\u0001)ofFlink withFswap\u003C Flink:For\nexample, when link level entanglements are assumed to be\nWerner states, \u0011(Flink) = 1=4 + 3=4((4Flink\u00001)=3)2[1].\nEntanglement Puriﬁcation [9]: The EPR pairs obtained\nafter entanglement swapping may not be perfect and may\nhave low ﬁdelities. Assume that end user iandjshare a\nnumber\u0014(\u00152)of imperfect EPR pairs j\u001Biji. However,\nnodesiandjcan perform local gates, measurements on \u0014\nj\u001BijiEPR pairs along with classical information exchange\nto obtain a single higher quality EPR pair. This operation is\nknown as entanglement puriﬁcation. Note that, entanglementpuriﬁcation is probabilistic. We refer interested readers to [8]\nfor a more elaborate explanation of the puriﬁcation procedure.\nThis procedure can be repeated in a nested manner on the\nnewly puriﬁed set of EPR pairs until desired ﬁdelity is\nachieved.\nB. System Model\nIn this Section, we introduce the system model used in the\nrest of the paper. We summarize notations in Table I.\nion, we introduce the system model used in the\nrest of the paper. We summarize notations in Table I. We use\nthe notation PX(x)to represent the probability that the random\nvariableXtakes the value x, i.e.,PX(x) = Pr[X=x]. Also,\nletE[X]denote the expected value of random variable X:\nWe use a bold letter symbol, such as VVV, to represent a vector.\nEnd-to-end User Entanglement Requests: We assume\ntime is slotted with slot duration \u0001seconds. Let ndenote\na time slot with n2f0;1;\u0001\u0001\u0001g. At each time slot, requests\nto createj\u001E+\nijiarrive at the switch. Let Aij(n)denote the\nnumber of such requests arriving in time slot n. We assume\nfAij(n)gn\u00150to be mutually independent i.i.d processes with\nrate\u0015ij, i.e.E[Aij(n)] =\u0015ij,i;j2f1;Kg. We also assume\nthat these requests require an application level minimum\ntarget ﬁdelity1ofFth.\nLink Level Entanglement Generation: At the beginning of\neach time slot (say n), the network infrastructure attempts to\ncreate\u000Bmax number of link level entanglements between an\nend useriand the switch. We assume the switch and the user\nhas enough quantum memory to store all entanglements. We\ndenotepito be the success probability to create a single link\nlevel entanglement between user iand the switch in each of\nthese attempts. pi=e\u0000\u0012di, wherediis the length of link\niand\u0012is its attenuation coefﬁcient. Denote ppp= [pi;i=\n1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;K]:Clearly, the number of link level entanglements\ngenerated between user iand the switch ( Ti(n)) is a binomial\nrandom variable with parameters \u000Bmax andpi, i.e.,\nPTi(ai) =\u0012\u000Bmax\nai\u0013\npai\ni(1\u0000pi)\u000Bmax\u0000ai; ai= 0;:::;\u000Bmax\n1Throughout the paper, the ﬁdelity of a state is always with respect to the\nideal EPR pairj\u001E+i.\n3LetAdenote the set of all feasible vectors of\nT(n)T(n)T(n) = [T1(n);\u0001\u0001\u0001;TK(n)], i.e.,A=f0;1;2;\u0001\u0001\u0001;\u000BmaxgK.\nWe assume the link level entanglements to be valid only for a\nsingle time slot and they decohere at the end of the time slot.\nDenoteFlink to be the ﬁdelity of a successfully generated\nlink level entanglement. Due to noise induced \nteFlink to be the ﬁdelity of a successfully generated\nlink level entanglement. Due to noise induced in the link,\nFlink\u003C1.\nNested Entanglement Puriﬁcation: When the ﬁdelities of the\nend-to-end entanglements generated after swaps are less than\nFth, the entanglements become unusable for consumption at\nthe application level. To circumvent this issue, one can perform\nnested entanglement puriﬁcation on these low quality entangle-\nments to generate entanglements with a target ﬁdelity. Suppose\nYdenotes the random variable representing the total number\nof output EPR pairs with ﬁdelity greater than Fthproduced by\na nested puriﬁcation routine by consuming Xlow quality EPR\npairs. We refer to PYjXandE[YjX]as the conditional yield2\ndistribution and the conditional expected yield of the nested\nentanglement puriﬁcation routine. We derive expressions for\nPYjXandE[YjX]for different classes of nested entanglement\npuriﬁcation protocols in Section IV. Such a puriﬁcation can\nbe performed before or after entanglement swapping routine\nresulting in the following two architectures as shown in Figure\n2 (a) and (b).\n(a)Purify and swap (PS) architecture - In this architecture,\nnested entanglement puriﬁcation is ﬁrst performed on\nindividual link level entanglements after which entangle-\nment swapping is performed.\n(b)Swap and purify (SP) architecture - This architecture\nﬁrst performs entanglement swapping on link level en-\ntanglements followed by end-to-end puriﬁcation.\nLetDij(n)(~Dij(n)) denote the number of high quality\nend-to-end entanglements that are delivered to the requesting\napplication at time slot n;each with ﬁdelity Ffinal (~Ffinal )\nsuch thatFfinal\u0015Fth(~Ffinal\u0015Fth) in the SP (PS)\narchitecture.\nEntanglement Scheduling: At the beginning of each time\nslot, the switch stores the unserved requests in a queue. Let\nQij(n)(~Qij(n)) denote the queue size in time slot nin\nthe SP (PS) architecture. Also, let Q(n)Q(n)Q(n) = [Qij(n);i=\n1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Kandj=i+ 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;K]. Similarly, let ~Q(n)~Q(n)~Q(n) =\n[~Q\ne. Also, let Q(n)Q(n)Q(n) = [Qij(n);i=\n1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Kandj=i+ 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;K]. Similarly, let ~Q(n)~Q(n)~Q(n) =\n[~Qij(n);i= 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Kandj=i+ 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;K]. The switch\nmakes scheduling decisions in each time slot and selects\nWij(n)(~Wij(n)) number of link level entanglements to per-\nform entanglement swapping under SP (PS). Since entan-\nglement swapping procedures are probabilistic (with success\nprobabilityqij), only a fraction of Wij(n)(~Wij(n)) EPR pairs\nare created between user iandjat time slot nunder SP\n(PS) architecture. Denote qqq= [qij;i= 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Kandj=\ni+ 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;K],W(n)W(n)W(n) = [Wij(n);i= 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Kandj=\n2Note that, the deﬁnition of yield is slightly different from what has been\nused in literature.

C APACITY REGION COMPUTATION : M AINRESULTS\nIn this section, we present the main results related to the\ncapacity region computation of a switch under both PS and\nSP architecture. We also propose corresponding max weight\nscheduling policies that stabilize the switch for all feasible\nrequest arrival rates. We relegate the proofs in this section to\nthe Appendix VIII.\nDeﬁnition 1: A switch is deﬁned to be stable under a\nscheduling policy if the process fQ(n)Q(n)Q(n)g1\nn=0converges in\ndistribution to QQQindependent of the initial condition and\nE[QQQ]\u003C1[21].\nDeﬁnition 2: The capacity region \u0003of a switch is deﬁned\nto be the set of request rates \u0015\u0015\u0015for which the switch remains\nstable.\nA. PS Architecture\nIn this architecture, entanglement puriﬁcation is ﬁrst per-\nformed on link level entanglements, followed by entanglement\nswap. We denote ~Ti(n)and ~Flink to be the number of\nlink-level entanglements and their ﬁdelities after link-level\npuriﬁcation is performed. Since, the puriﬁcation is on the link\nlevel, we need to identify a target threshold for ﬁdelity on\nlink-level (Fth\nlink). We setFth\nlink=\u0011\u00001(Fth).

Symmetric Puriﬁcation Protocols\nIn symmetric puriﬁcation protocols, puriﬁcation is per-\nformed on identical EPR pairs, i.e., all input EPR pairs have\nequal ﬁdelities. The protocol is often performed in multiple\nrounds, hence also known as recurrence protocol [9]. At each\npuriﬁcation round, the total number of available EPR pairs\nare divided into groups of \u0014 \u003E 1number of EPR pairs as\nshown in Figure 3 (a). Puriﬁcation is then performed on each\ngroup. If the puriﬁcation is successful, then only one EPR pair\nout of\u0014EPR pairs are kept in each group. If the puriﬁcation\nis unsuccessful, all of the \u0014EPR pairs are discarded. The\nremaining EPR pairs are used for puriﬁcation at the next round.\nAt each round, ﬁdelities of EPR pairs increase by a certain\nfraction after puriﬁcation. Puriﬁcation is continued until either\nthere are no EPR pairs left or the application level ﬁdelity\nthreshold is reached for the output EPR pairs. We denote L\nas the maximum number of puriﬁcation rounds.\nLetY(l)andF(l)denote the total number of output EPR\npairs and their ﬁdelities after lrounds of puriﬁcation for l=\n1;2;\u0001\u0001\u0001;L. Thus we have F(L)\u0015FthbutF(L\u00001)\u003C Fth:\nWe also have Y(L)=YandY(0)=X:\nLetxdenote the total number of input EPR pairs, each\nwith ﬁdelity F, available at the beginning for puriﬁcation.

Here,\u001FS(\u0001)is the output ﬁdelity function.\nPuriﬁcation is probabilistic and its success probability de-\npends on the ﬁdelity of the input EPR pairs.

Note that, depending on the input state of an EPR\npair,!S(\u0001)and\u001FS(\u0001)may be different. Consider the density\noperator representation of an input EPR pair as shown in\nEquation (1). When F1=FandF2=F3=F4= (1\u0000F)=3;\nwe call the entangled state a Werner state (White noise). When\nF1=Fand only one of F2;F3orF3is non-zero, i.e., equals\nto(1\u0000F), the state is called a Binary state. For example: if\nthe channel has bit ﬂip errors, then a particular kind of binary\nstate (F1=F;F 2=F4= 0;F3= 1\u0000F) is generated.\n6Remark 1: The expressions for success probability and out-\nput ﬁdelity functions presented in Table II assume no quantum\ngate errors or measurement errors. However, these expressions\ncan be easily modiﬁed to account for such imperfections [1],\n[12].\nB. Entanglement Pumping\nEntanglement Pumping [9] is an asymmetric puriﬁcation\nprotocol where one EPR pair is puriﬁed using multiple auxil-\niary EPR pairs until a desired\niﬁcation\nprotocol where one EPR pair is puriﬁed using multiple auxil-\niary EPR pairs until a desired target ﬁdelity is achieved. Then\nthe process repeats itself to produce more high quality EPR\npairs until all auxiliary EPR pairs are exhausted. The protocol\nis shown in Figure 3 (b). We call the EPR pair that goes under\npuriﬁcation as primary and other auxiliary pairs as base EPR\npairs.\nWe start with a given number of base EPR pairs with\nFidelityF:We select the ﬁrst base EPR pair to be a primary\nEPR pair and purify it using the second base EPR pair.\nIf the puriﬁcation is successful, the ﬁdelity of the primary\nEPR pair increases by a fraction and the base EPR pair gets\nsacriﬁced. The primary EPR pair then repeatedly gets puriﬁed\nby sacriﬁcing other base EPR pairs until its ﬁdelity is above\nFth. If a puriﬁcation fails at any step, the next primary EPR\npair is chosen from the set of remaining base EPR pairs and\nthe puriﬁcation process repeats from the beginning.\nSimilar to the deﬁnitions in Section IV-A, let F(l)denote\nthe ﬁdelity of a primary EPR pair after lrounds of puriﬁcation.\nSupposeLrounds of puriﬁcation is needed for a primary EPR\npair to achieve the target ﬁdelity. Since entanglement pumping\nis asymmetric, the ﬁdelities of input EPR pairs for a single\npuriﬁcation operation are different. We denote \u001FA(F(k);F)\nand!A(F(k);F)to be the output ﬁdelity of a primary EPR\npair and puriﬁcation success probability functions respectively.\nThus we have, F(l)=\u001FA(F(l\u00001);F):We denoter(l)\nAto be\nthe puriﬁcation success probability for round l;i.e.r(l)\nA=\n!A(F(l\u00001);F):\nWe use the theory of discrete-time renewal processes [11]\nto derive the distribution PYjXfor entanglement pumping\nprotocol as follows. Henceforth, we will call the puriﬁed\nprimary EPR pair with ﬁdelity greater than Fthas a high\nquality EPR pair. We refer to the event of generating a high\nquality EPR pair as a renewal event. We sequentially select\na base pair to purify the primary EPR pair and the ids of\nbase EPR pa\n event. We sequentially select\na base pair to purify the primary EPR pair and the ids of\nbase EPR pairs can be mapped to (discrete) time in a renewal\nprocess. The number of EPR pairs sacriﬁced to generate one\nhigh quality EPR pair can be considered as the renewal inter-\noccurrence time. Let ~Xi;i= 1;2;\u0001\u0001\u0001;denote such renewal\ninter-occurrence times with distribution P~X. Thus, by the\ntheory of renewal processes [11], the conditional expected\nyield is given by the following recursion.\nE[YjX=x] =xX\ni=1[1 +E[YjX=x\u0000i]]P~X(i); (11)\nwithE[YjX=j] = 0;8j2f0;1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Lg.\nNow, let ~Sk;k= 1;2;\u0001\u0001\u0001;denote renewal event oc-\ncurrence times, i.e. ~Sk=Pk\ni=1~Xi: P ~Skcan be foundout byk\u0000fold convolution using the recursion, P~Sk(s) =Ps\ni=1P~X(i)P~Sk\u00001(s\u0000i):The conditional yield distribution\nPYjXcan be computed as\nPYjX(yjx) =xX\ni=1P~Sy(i)\u0000xX\ni=1P~Sy+1(i): (12)\nFinally, the distribution P~Xcan be computed by the following\nrecursion.\nP~X(i) =LY\nl=1r(l)\nA\u0014\n1\u0000i\u0000L\u00001X\nk=1P~X(k)\u0015\n\u0001 1i=2I; (13)\nHere,P~X(i) = 0;8i2 f0;1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Lg. The setIin the\nindicator function denotes the infeasibility set of a puriﬁcation\nscheme. For example, for a 2 : 1 puriﬁcation scheme with\nL= 1,I=fiji%26= 0g;i.e. the set of odd numbers.\nV. N UMERICAL RESULTS\nIn this section we perform a numerical study to compare the\nperformance of different architectures and puriﬁcation proto-\ncols. In order to obtain the boundary of the capacity region, we\nsolve optimization problem (7) using the IBM CPLEX solver.\nThe goals of this study are to (i) compare the performance of\nPS and SP architectures, (ii) to determine which puriﬁcation\nprotocol works best with respect to switch stability, and (iii)\nthe effect of different network and application-level parameters\non the capacity region of the switch. We ﬁrst present the\nexperimental setup and then discuss the results.\nParameter K \u000B maxpiqijFlinkFth\nValue 3 10 0 :9 0:9 0:90 0:85\nTable III: Parameters used for numerical studies.\nWe consider three end users connected to a quantum\nentanglement\nrameters used for numerical studies.\nWe consider three end users connected to a quantum\nentanglement distribution switch with request arrival vector\n\u0015= [\u001512;\u001513]and\u001523= 0:We assume the distance\nbetween the switch and an end user to be 2:3km with\nﬁber attenuation coefﬁcient 0.2 dB/km [6]. Unless speciﬁed,\nwe use the parameters presented in Table III for numerical\nsimulations.\nComparison of PS and SP architectures: We compare the\ncapacity region of PS and SP under the DEJMPS protocol\nas shown in Figure 4 (a). We observe that PS has a larger\ncapacity region compared to SP. This advocates that the\nswitch under PS is stable for a wider range of end-user\nentanglement generation demands and thus, more robust to\nunexpected demand ﬂuctuations. We obtain similar results for\nother puriﬁcation protocols listed in Table II and hence, we\nomit them. Hence forth, for all remaining experiments, we\nwill use the PS architecture to determine the capacity regions.\nWe also plot the Noise Less capacity region, which serves\nas an upper bound on the maximum capacity that can be\nachieved by any puriﬁcation scheme under any architecture.\nThe Noise Less capacity region is obtained for the setting\nwhere there is no notion of Fthand links as well as quantum\noperations are assumed to be perfect.

(c)-(f) are computed for PS\narchitecture and DEJMPS puriﬁcation protocol.\ncapacity is signiﬁcantly higher than those achieved by any of\nthe architectures. The gap between Noise Less capacity and\ncapacities of puriﬁcation architectures in Figure 4(a) suggests\nthat there could be room for improvement in puriﬁcation\nprotocol performance.\nComparison of Puriﬁcation Protocols: We now compare the\ncapacity regions achieved by three puriﬁcation protocols: two\nsymmetric (DEJMPS, BBPSSW) and one asymmetric (Pump-\ning). In entanglement pumping, the functions \u001FA(F(k);F)\nand!A(F(k);F)are computed using an asymmetric version\nof DEJMPS protocol [9]. We set Fth= 0:9. In Figure 4\n(b), we observe that DEJMPS protocol outperforms the other\nprotocols. DEJMPS requires fewer puriﬁcation rounds ( L) than\nBBPSSW to reach a target ﬁdelity. As the number of base EPR\npairs that are sacriﬁced grows exponentially with L, DEJMPS\nhas a larger capacity region. Note that, in [19], DEJMPS\nwas found to be the optimal two-qubit distillation protocol\nfor Bell-diagonal states. Our results presented in Figure 4 (b)\ncorroborates the optimality result.\nBit-ﬂip Noise versus White Noise: We compare the perfor-\nmance of DEJMPS protocol under two different noise models:\nBit-ﬂip noise and White noise as shown in Figure 4 (c).\nShort descriptions of both models is found in Section IV-A.\nWe consider two settings: Fth= 0:85andFth= 0:9.\nWhenFth= 0:85, both noise models require one ( L= 1)\npuriﬁcation round. In this setting, DEJMPS under White noise\nproduces lower quality EPR pairs with higher success proba-\nbility compared to Bit-ﬂip model. Since, we \nuces lower quality EPR pairs with higher success proba-\nbility compared to Bit-ﬂip model. Since, we are only interestedin the yield, the success probability component dominates\nin capacity region calculations. Thus DEJMPS under White\nNoise provides a slightly larger capacity region as compared\nto that of under Bit-ﬂip noise. However, for a more stringent\nrequirement on Fth(Fth= 0:9),L= 1and2for Bit-ﬂip and\nWhite noise models respectively. The number of EPR pairs\nthat are sacriﬁced grows exponentially with L, resulting in a\nsigniﬁcantly smaller capacity region under White noise model.\nWe conclude that White noise is difﬁcult to deal with under\nstringent application level quality requirements.\nEffect of\u000Bmax:In Figure 4(d), we study the effect of \u000Bmax\n(number of link-level entanglement attempts) on the capacity\nregion of the switch. We compute the Noise Less capacity for\n\u000Bmax= 2 and compare it to the noisy capacity for different\nvalues of\u000Bmax;starting with \u000Bmax = 2:We observe that\nthe Noise Less capacity is signiﬁcantly larger than the noisy\ncapacity for the same value of \u000Bmax. As expected, increasing\n\u000Bmax increases the noisy capacity. We also observe that one\nhas to make at least three times more link-level entanglement\nattempts (black curve) to achieve the noise-less capacity.\nEffect ofFlink andFth:We study the effect of Flink\nandFthon the capacity region of the switch in Figures 4\n(e) and (f) respectively. With an increase in the quality of\ninitial link-level entanglements, larger capacity regions are\nobtained as shown in Figure 4 (e). Note that, the improvement\nin performance is minute between Flink = 0:86and0:88\nbut signiﬁcant between Flink= 0:88and0:9. This can be\nexplained by the fact that L= 2 whenFlink= 0:86;0:88\n8andL= 1 whenFlink= 0:9;0:92:Thus the transition from\nFlink= 0:88toFlink= 0:9involves one less number of\npuriﬁcation round resulting in signiﬁcant gain in terms of\ncapacity. We also compare the capacity regions of the switch\nfor different values of Ft\n in terms of\ncapacity. We also compare the capacity regions of the switch\nfor different values of Fthin Figure 4 (f). We observe that the\ncapacity region reduces drastically with stringent application\nlevel quality requirements.\nVI. C ONCLUSION AND OPEN PROBLEMS\nIn this work, we analyzed the effect of channel noise and\nentanglement puriﬁcation on the capacity region of a quantum\nswitch. Going further, we would like to extend our analysis to\nan arbitrary network setting. Conceptually, this seems doable\nprovided that there is a predeﬁned path in place for each\nuser pair. However, the number of optimization variables in\n(7) can grow rapidly as a function of numbers of nodes\nand user pairs. Also, the focus of this work has been on\na swap-purify architecture and a purify-swap architecture. It\nwould be interesting to consider an alternate purify-swap-\npurify architecture where link-level entanglements are puriﬁed\nfollowed by swaps followed by end-to-end puriﬁcation. For\nthe network setting, one can of course perform multi-hop\npuriﬁcation, then do swapping followed by again multi-hop\npuriﬁcation.\nVII.

This\nhas led to their use as memory qubits in quantum information platforms, where they are controlled via\nelectromagnetic waves. Scaling up such platforms comes with challenges in terms of power efficiency, aswell as cross-talk between devices.

INTRODUCTION\nNuclear spins couple weakly to their environment and\nthus display the longest coherence times among all solid-\nins couple weakly to their environment and\nthus display the longest coherence times among all solid-state systems [1–3], making them desirable quantum\nmemories. They have been incorporated into variousquantum information protocols such as error correction[4], quantum teleportation [5], entanglement distillation\n[6], and multiqubit entanglement, between both local [2]\nand distant [7]qubits. Two main approaches have been\ndeveloped to control nuclear spins: direct radio frequencydriving [1,2,8 –10]and indirect microwave driving via the\nhyperfine coupling to a neighboring electronic spin[4,11,12] . An alternative approach using all-electrical\ncontrol has been demonstrated, by using ensembles of\nnuclear spins [13], by relying on the presence of a\nquadrupolar interaction [14], or by using a second-order\nhyperfine Stark effect in single molecules [15]. Mechanical\ninterfacing of nuclear spins would be highly desirable forhybrid quantum architectures, owing to the ability of\nmechanical vibrations to couple to diverse quantum systems[16–18]. So far, only signatures of coupling between\nmechanical vibrations and nuclear spin ensembles via the\nquadrupolar interaction have been shown [19,20] ,w i t ha\nrecent proposal to extend this technique to single nuclearspins [21]. However, mechanical control of single nuclear\nspins has not yet been demonstrated, and it is unclear whetherthe coherence of the nuclear spins would be negativelyimpacted. Here, we demonstrate the control of a single\nnuclear spin using mechanical vibrations, with a technique\nthat is compatible with any nuclear spin. We demonstrateeffective Rabi frequencies of about 10 kHz, which iscomparable to other techniques [1,2,9,10] , and we confirm\nthat the nuclear spin retains its excellent coherence proper-ties. This approach has several advantages for scalability:Mechanical waves are generated using surface acoustic\ndevices, which are relatively easy to fabricate.

Finally,\nthis approach requires about 2 –3 orders of magnitude less\npower compared to other approaches [1,2,9,13,14,27] ,\nthereby reducing heating, which is a concern for many\nlow-temperature experiments [2,12,28] .

RESULTS\nIn our experiments, the interaction between the nuclear\nspin and mechanical vibrations is mediated by a single,negatively charged, silicon-vacancy center (SiV). The\nmechanical vibrations are surface acoustic waves (SAWs),\nwhich have natural two-dimensional confinement, can beguided on chip and are easily generated by electricalexcitation of interdigital transducers (IDTs) [29]. We pattern\naluminium IDTs on top of a layer of piezoelectric aluminium\nnitride deposited on the surface of a single-crystal diamond.The diamond sample is ultrapure (nitrogen concentration less\nthan 5 ppb) and has a natural abundance of the\n13Ci s o t o p e\n(1.1%). The diamond is implanted with28Siþions and\nannealed to form SiV centers, which can be opticallyaddressed individually. The SiVs are located wit\nannealed to form SiV centers, which can be opticallyaddressed individually. The SiVs are located within the strain\nfield of the SAW, which extends about a wavelength (about\n3μm) below the surface of the diamond [Fig. 1(a)]. The\nsample is cooled to below 200 mK in a dilution refrigerator to\nincrease the lifetime of the SiVelectron spin ( S¼1=2)[30].\nAn external magnetic field of 0.13 T at an angle of 90° withrespect to the SiVaxis lifts the spin degeneracy and introducesa splitting of f\n↓↑¼3.42GHz between the j↓iandj↑ispin\nstates [Fig. 1(b)]. The field angle of 90° is chosen to maximize\nthe strain susceptibility of the SiV spin [31].T h eo p t i c a l\ntransition labeled ↓↓0can be excited resonantly by laser\npulses to initialize the SiV in j↑ivia optical pumping, while\nthe↓↑transition can be driven acoustically to coherently\ntransfer population between j↓iandj↑i[29].\nThe mechanical coupling to the13C nuclear spin\n(S¼1=2) relies on the simultaneous coupling of a SiV\nelectronic spin to acoustic waves and to the nuclear spin. An\nindividual13C nuclear spin couples to a SiV spin via the\nhyperfine interaction Hamiltonian\nH¼2πℏSSiVzðAkSnuczþA⊥SnucxÞ;\nwhere Si¼σi=2are the spin operators, with σibeing the\nPauli matrices for i∈fx; y; z g(“SiV”and “nuc”indicate\nSiV and nuclear spins, respectively), and AkandA⊥are the\nparallel and perpendicular components of the hyperfine\ncoupling. This coupling causes the nuclear spin to precess\nabout slightly different axes depending on the state of the SiV\nspin. This can be utilized to control the nuclear spin state[4,27,32] with the basic sequence depicted in Fig. 1(c). After\nthe SiV spin is initialized in j↑i, a series of periodically timed\nacoustic pulses (with interpulse delay τ) flip its state\nrepeatedly, causing the nuclear spin to alternate betweentwo different precession axes.

This is a conditional rotation gate, denoted by\nR\nϕ\nn↓;n↑, that entangles the SiVand nuclear spins, and it is the\nbuilding block of all the nuclear spin control sequences\nperformed in this work.\nWe identify a target13C spin by performing nuclear spin\nresonance spectroscopy using the SiV [4,32] . The SiV spin\nis initialized in j↑i, after which an acoustic pulse performs a\nπ=2rotation of the spin to bring it into the superposition\nstate ðj↑iþj↓iÞ=ﬃﬃﬃ\n2p\n. A series of acoustic πpulses then\nperform an XY8 sequence [33], whereby the SiV spin is\nflipped repeatedly around two different axes ( X,Y) on the\nBloch sphere, depending on the phase (0 or π=2) of each\npulse [Fig. 2(a)]. A final acoustic π=2pulse is then applied\nto the SiV spin before its state is read out by optical\nexcitation of the ↓↓0transition and collection of the\nresulting fluorescence. This pulse sequence increases the\ncoherence time of the SiV spin by decoupling it from\nmagnetic field noise [34] while allowing its selective\ncoupling to individual13C nuclear spins. Figure 2(b)shows\nthe measurement of the SiV population in j↓iafter an XY8\nsequence as the interpulse time τis varied. For values of τ\ncorresponding to resonance with a particular13C spin, the\nSiV spin state coherently evolves in conjunction with the\nnuclear spin. This appears as periodic sharp dips.

The most\nprominent dips in Fig. 2(b) can be ascribed to a single\nnuclear spin, and their positions and depths can be\nmodeled to extract the hyperfine coupling parameters\nfAk¼0.11MHz ;A⊥¼0.33MHz g[34].\nHaving identified the target nuclear spin, we proceed to\ninitialize it. The sequence for nuclear spin initialization isshown in Fig. 3(a). It consists of π=2rotations of the SiV\nspin and conditional rotations of the nuclear spin imple-\nmented as XY8 sequences on the SiV spin [4,27,32] .W e\nsimulate the state of the nuclear spin at the end of theinitialization sequence for values of the interpulse delay τin\nthe vicinity of the τ¼1.578μs resonance, as shown in\nFig. 3(b).F o r τ¼1.569μs, if the SiV is set to j↑i\nSiV\n(j↓iSiV) at the beginning of the sequence, the nuclear spin is\ninitialized in j↓inuc(j↑inuc) at the end of it. The nuclear spin\nreadout sequence corresponds to the same sequence inreverse, and it transfers the nuclear spin onto the SiV spin.The experimental results for the full sequence for variousvalues of τare shown as dots in Fig. 3(c), with simulations\nshown as solid curves. For τ¼1.569μs, the final state of\nthe SiV depends on the state in which the nuclear spin wasinitialized. The experimental data agree with the expectedresults from the simulation, thus confirming the successful\ninitialization and readout of the nuclear spin. The parasitic\npartial addressing of other\n13C nuclear spins with similar\nhyperfine couplings to the SiV limits the fidelity of theinitialization and readout sequences to 0.91 [34]. The\nexperimentally measured fidelities are 0.85/C60.03and\n0.91/C60.02for initialization into the j↓inucand j↑inuc\nstates, respectively, with readout fidelities equal to the\ninitialization fidelities. Although a similar initialization\nsequence could be constructed with τ¼1.586μs, its\nfidelity is inferior, as seen in Fig. 3(c), because of parasitic\npartial addressing of other nuclear spins. The fidelity can be\nimproved\n. 3(c), because of parasitic\npartial addressing of other nuclear spins. The fidelity can be\nimproved by operating at longer interpulse delay times to\nbetter resolve individual nuclear spin resonances.\nIf the interpulse delay is τ0¼1.578μs, the XY8\nsequence rotates the nuclear spin around the Xaxis of\nthe Bloch sphere by an angle dependent on the number ofpulses N\n0in the sequence. By inserting such an XY8\nsequence between the nuclear spin initialization and read-\nout sequences [Fig. 3(d)], and varying N0, we perform\ncoherent rotations of the nuclear spin, as demonstrated bythe observation of Rabi oscillations shown in Fig. 3(e).W e\nnote that N\n0¼8corresponds to a π=2rotation of the\nnuclear spin.

We\nperform two π=2rotations of the nuclear spin separated\nby a variable delay, whereby the nuclear spin is broughtinto a superposition state that precesses freely before beingread out [Fig. 4(a)]. Immediately after the first π=2rotation\nof the nuclear spin, the SiV is initialized in either j↑i(red\ndots) or j↓i(blue dots), which causes the nuclear spin to\nprecess at a rate that depends on the state of the SiV spin,as shown in Fig. 4(b), with precession frequencies\nf\nRamsey\n↑;↓¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ\nðfL/C6Ak=2Þ2þðA⊥=2Þ2q\n. This difference in\nprecession frequencies confirms that we address a singlenuclear spin. We repeat the measurement for longer free\nprecession times for a single orientation of the SiV spin, asdisplayed in Fig. 4(c). The amplitude of the Ramsey\noscillations does not decrease up to precession times of\n2 ms, indicating that the nuclear spin retains its coherenceabove this timescale, T\n/C3\n2≫2ms. Next, we perform a spin-\necho sequence by inserting a nuclear πrotation between the\ntwoπ=2rotations, as illustrated in Fig. 4(d). The πrotation\ncancels the impact of any dephasing mechanism that is\nslower than the free precession timescale. The nuclear spinstate at the end of the sequence is plotted as a function of\nthe total precession time in Fig. 4(e)and shows no sign of\ndecay, indicating T\necho\n2≫10ms. Because of the limited\nphoton collection efficiency of our system, measurements\nfor longer precession times are impractical, considering the\nexperimental times required.

CONCLUSION\nTo conclude, we coherently control a single nuclear s\nV . X 12,011056 (2022)\n011056-4III. CONCLUSION\nTo conclude, we coherently control a single nuclear spin\nwith surface acoustic waves, using a SiV center as aninterface, and show that the nuclear spin retains its excellentcoherence properties. The power required for this approach is\n2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that for other techniques\n[1,2,9,13,14,27,34] . This is particularly important when\noperating at cryogenic temperatures at which cooling poweris limited, and it is therefore crucial for scaling up to morecomplex control sequences, as well as multiple spins and\ncontrol channels. This technique can be applied to control\nother nuclear and electronic spins implanted into diamondand coupled to the SiV spin. This approach can also beextended to platforms other than diamond, if an electronic\nspin with strain susceptibility comparable to that of the SiV\ncan be found. Future developments for this work includeintegration with photonic structures such as tapered wave-guides, which will increase the photon collection efficiency\nand enable single-shot spin readout [30]. Integration with\nphononic waveguides [22–26]will enable the routing of\nmultiple acoustic control signals on chip and the control ofmultiple spins with low cross-talk. Therefore, these results\nopen a path towards the integration of multiple, optically\naddressable spins and long-lived quantum memories in ascalable way, using surface acoustic waves for control.Additionally, using a SiV with a resident\n29Si nuclear spin\nenables the resolution of hyperfine energy levels [35], which\ncould be used to achieve entanglement between the SiVand\nthe nuclear spin with a single πpulse. At the same time,\nstrong coupling between the SiV spin and a single phononcould be achieved using a high-quality-factor, low-mode-volume mechanical resonator [31,36,37] , thus enabling\nsingle-phonon spin gates. This would enable the use ofsingle nuclear spins as quantum memories for phononicstates, with potential applications in metrol\nofsingle nuclear spins as quantum memories for phononicstates, with potential applications in metrology, quantum\nsensing [38], quantum information processing [16,39 –42],\nand fundamental tests of quantum theory [43–45].\nThe data shown in the figures is available in Ref.

Silicon ions (\n28Siþ)\nare implanted on the top surface of the diamond at an\nenergy of 150 keV and a density of 1010cm−2, introducing\nSi atoms over the entire surface at a depth of 100/C618nm\nas determined by a SRIM simulation [47]. SiV centers are\ngenerated by a high-temperature ( 1200 °C), high-vacuum\nannealing procedure followed by a tri-acid cleaning ( 1∶1∶1\nsulphuric, perchloric, and nitric acids). A 1.4-μm alumin-\nium nitride (AlN) layer is deposited on top of the diamondby rf sputtering. IDTs are fabricated using electron beam\nlithography followed by evaporation of 75 nm of alumin-\nium (Al). The SAWs propagate along the ½110/C138direction,\nparallel to one of the edges of the sample. Further details onthe design and characterizat\nirection,\nparallel to one of the edges of the sample. Further details onthe design and characterization of IDTs may be found\nin Ref. [29].\nAPPENDIX B: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nLow-temperature measurements are performed in a\n3He=4He dilution refrigerator (Bluefors LD250) with a\nbase temperature of 10 mK. The diamond sample is\nmounted on a plate that is thermally anchored to themixing plate of the refrigerator. The diamond is affixedwith indium foil to a custom-made holder made of copper,\nwhich is located on top of an XY nanopositioner stack.\nIDTs on the sample are wire bonded to a printed circuitboard (PCB) mounted on the holder for electrical excitationof acoustic pulses. A thermometer located close to the\nsample indicates a typical temperature of 50 –200 mK\nduring our experiments. The sample is surrounded by athree-axis superconducting vector magnet system used toapply a static magnetic field. Above the sample, a cryo-\ngenic objective (attocube LT-APO/VISIR/0.82) with a\nnumerical aperture of 0.82 and a working distance of0.65 mm is mounted on a Z nanopositioner. A homemade\nconfocal microscope is used for optical excitation andfluorescence collection. A tunable laser stabilized to anaccuracy of 0.01 pm using feedback from a wavelength\nmeter is used to resonantly excite optical transitions of\nindividual SiVs. Photons emitted by individual SiVs in thephonon sideband (PSB) greater than 740 nm are selectedby an optical long-pass filter and sent to an avalanchephotodiode (APD).\nAPPENDIX C: GENERATION OF OPTICAL\nAND ACOUSTIC PULSES\nLaser pulses at 737 nm are generated using an acousto-\noptic modulator (AOM). The AOM is driven by a custom-built rf driver and is used in a double-pass configuration to\nachieve an extinction ratio greater than 70 dB, which is\nrequired to prevent unwanted optical spin pumping duringlong experimental sequences. A time-correlated single pho-ton counter (TCSPC) is used to record arrival times ofphotons emitted from the SiV. An arbitrary waveform\ngenerat\nTCSPC) is used to record arrival times ofphotons emitted from the SiV. An arbitrary waveform\ngenerator (AWG) controls the entire experimental sequence.\nThe 8-bit analog output of the AWG is used to drive the IDTs,while the two 1-bit marker outputs are used to control theAOM and trigger the TCSPC. There is a small amount of driftbetween the clocks of the AWG and TCSPC, with a factor\nof about 1.25×10\n−5, for which we correct in our data\nprocessing.\nAPPENDIX D: SiV SPIN INITIALIZATION\nThe SiV can be initialized in j↑iorj↓iby resonantly\npumping the optical transitions ↓↓0or↑↑0, respectively.\nFor our experiments, after the acoustic πpulse is calibrated,\nwe initialize the SiV in j↑iby optically pumping ↓↓0, and\ninj↓i, by optically pumping ↓↓0followed by an acoustic π\npulse. This allows us to keep the wavelength of the laserresonant with the ↓↓\n0transition. We insert an acoustic π\npulse between the final optical readout pulse of one\nexperimental sequence and the optical initialization pulse\nof the next sequence so that the SiV is in j↓ibefore the\ninitialization pulse. This allows the photon counts duringthe initialization pulse to be used as a measure of the\npopulation in j↓i.\nAPPENDIX E: SiV SPIN POPULATION\nMEASUREMENT\nThe arrival times of photons emitted by the SiV are\naccumulated in a histogram over multiple ( 10\n6−108)\nrepetitions of the experimental sequence. The fluorescence\nphoton counts are integrated for the first 100 ns of optical\npumping [34]. The spin population of the SiV is measured as\nthe ratio of the integrated fluorescence during the opticalreadout pulse to that during the optical initialization pulse.The spin projection of the SiVis calculated as hσ\nzi¼1–2P↓,\nin which P↓is the population in the j↓istate.SMARAK MAITY et al.

In this work, we propose a protocol to distill\nmulti-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states among\nthe nodes of a network using quantum error correcting codes.\nThe method builds upon a Bell state distillation protocol by\nWilde et al. (2007) that we recently generalized to 3-qubit GHZ\nstates. The key technical result that enables our protocol shows\nhow measuring a Pauli operator, or in general a set of code\nstabilizers, on one subsystem of a multipartite GHZ state affects\nthe other subsystems. The design and analysis of the protocol\nis driven by the stabilizer formalism for measurements, and\nwe provide discussions to elucidate the steps of the protocol.\nA similar approach can be applied to distill other multipartite\nentangled states as long as they are stabilizer states.\nIndex Terms —Quantum networks, stabilizer codes, GHZ\nstates, stabilizer formalism, entanglement distillation\nI.

Moreover, each of these nodes\ncould be built using different quantum technologies, such as\ntrapped-ions or superconducting qubits, but they must be able\nto interface with the network.

Typical entanglement distribution\nschemes are heralded and hence inefﬁcient. Since long-term\nrepeater architectures are designed to include quantum error\ncorrection (QEC) capabilities [3], it is pertinent to investigate\nentanglement distribution schemes that leverage QEC.\nThe idea of using quantum error correcting codes (QECCs)\nto distill entangled states was ﬁrst proposed by Bennett et\nal.in their seminal paper on mixed state entanglement and\nQEC [4]. In their approach, Alice locally produces kperfect\nBell pairs and then uses a QECC to protect the khalves from\nall pairs that are to be transmitted to Bob. The transmission\nhappens through multiple uses of quantum teleportation, where\nthe presh\nted to Bob. The transmission\nhappens through multiple uses of quantum teleportation, where\nthe preshared entangled resources between Alice and Bob\nare noisy. Hence, the khalves are explicitly encoded by\nAlice using an [ [n;k] ]QECC, then transmitted via quantum\nteleportation, and ﬁnally error corrected and decoded by Bob.\nIn 2007, Wilde et al. [5] used a different approach to distill\nBell pairs via QEC (see Fig. 1). Here, Alice generates nperfect\nBell pairs and sends one half of each pair to Bob through a\nnoisy channel. Then, she picks an [ [n;k] ]stabilizer code [6],\n[7] and measures the (n\u0000k)stabilizers on her nqubits (from\nall pairs). Due to a well-known “matrix transpose” property\nof Bell states (3), besides projecting her qubits onto the code\nsubspace (modulo some Pauli corrections), her measurements\nsimultaneously project Bob’s qubits to an equivalent code’s\nsubspace. Alice classically communicates her syndrome to\nBob, which he combines with his own syndrome to correct\nerrors on his qubits. If Bob’s error correction succeeds, then\nAlice’s and Bob’s qubits hold kperfect Bell pairs in the kpairs\nof logical qubits, which can be transformed into physical Bell\npairs by inversion of the encoding unitary on both parties.\nTherefore, this protocol does not have an explicit encoding\nstep as in the Bennett et al. protocol, and Alice’s measurement\ninduces the encoding. Note that there are no errors on her\nqubits that the syndrome measurement is supposed to correct.\nWhile the protocol is clear, it is not obvious why the k\nlogical qubits form logical Bell pairs just before the decodingFig. 1: The QEC based protocol by Wilde et al. [5] to distill\nBell pairs between Alice and Bob. Figure taken from [5].\n(unencoding) step. After introducing some background and\nnotation in Section II, we use the stabilizer formalism for mea-\nsurements [8] to brieﬂy clarify the reason for this phenomenon.\nWe refer the interested reader to [9] for a detailed discussion\nusing an explicit example. \nnomenon.\nWe refer the interested reader to [9] for a detailed discussion\nusing an explicit example. Then, we extend the protocol\nbeyond Bell states, where we distill `-qubit GHZ states using\nstabilizer codes. In order to develop this protocol, we establish\na technical result that shows how stabilizer measurements on\none subsystem of a GHZ state produces a joint code on all\nthe other subsystems. We had proven this result and developed\nthe protocol for `= 3in [9], and here we generalize to any `.\nOur work is well compatible with recent work on quantum\nrepeaters that exploit QEC. In [3], the authors considered a hy-\nbrid repeater scheme where the physical qubits actually belong\nto the subspace of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code,\nand there is an outer stabilizer code imposed on these GKP\nqubits. Using the [ [4;2;2] ]code and the [ [7;1;3] ]Steane code as\nexamples, they showed that the GKP analog information from\nthe inner round of error correction can help correct more errors\nthan these outer codes can normally correct. Thus, our QEC\nbased entanglement distillation protocol can be implemented\nin such repeater architectures. Recently, quantum low-density\nparity-check (QLDPC) codes with linearly scaling rate and\ndistance have been constructed [10]–[12], and the advantages\nof concatenating the GKP code with QLDPC codes has been\ndemonstrated [13]. Hence, employing concatenated QLDPC-\nGKP codes in our protocol could lead to high-rate high-output-\nﬁdelity entanglement distillation in quantum networks.\nII. B ACKGROUND AND NOTATION\nLetndenote the number of qubits in a quantum system.\nGiven binary (row) vectors a;b2Fn\n2, we will denote an n-\nqubit Hermitian Pauli matrix by E(a;b), whereai= 1 (resp.\nbi= 1) indicates Pauli X(resp.Z) on qubiti,ai=bi= 1\nindicates Pauli Yon qubiti, andai=bi= 0indicates identity\non qubiti. The weight of a Pauli is the number of qubits on\nwhich it acts non-trivially. For example, for n= 3 qubits,\nE([1;0;1];[0;1;1]) =X\nZ\nYand its weight is 3. S\nit acts non-trivially. For example, for n= 3 qubits,\nE([1;0;1];[0;1;1]) =X\nZ\nYand its weight is 3. SinceE(a;b)is Hermitian and unitary, it has eigenvalues \u00061and\nE(a;b)2=IN, whereN:= 2n. Then-qubit Pauli group is\nPn:=f{\u0014E(a;b); a;b2Fn\n2; \u00142Z4=f0;1;2;3gg;(1)\nwhere{:=p\u00001.

If\nthe generators ofSaref\"iE(ai;bi); i= 1;2;:::;rg, where\n\"i2f\u0006 1g, then the projector onto the subspace Q(S)is\n\u0005S=rY\ni=1(IN+\"iE(ai;bi))\n2: (2)\nWhenr=n,Sis said to be a maximal stabilizer group\nwhereQ(S)is a unique statej (S)iup to an unimportant\nglobal phase. Such a state is called a stabilizer state . Given a\nstabilizer state, the stabilizer formalism [8] provides a recipe\nto updateSwhen a Pauli measurement is performed on the\nstate. Let\u0017E(c;d)be measured on the state to obtain a result\n\u00162f\u0006 1g. Then, one of the following is applicable:\n1) Ifh[ai;bi];[c;d]is= 0 for alli2f1;:::;rg, thenS\nremains unchanged because \u0016\u0017E(c;d)2S already.\n2) Ifh[ai;bi];[c;d]is= 1 for exactly one i2f1;:::;rg,\nthen replace \"iE(ai;bi)with\u0016\u0017E(c;d).\n3) Ifh[ai;bi];[c;d]is= 1 fori2A\u0012f1;:::;rg, then\nreplace\"jE(aj;bj)with\u0016\u0017E(c;d)for onej2A,\nand for every other i2A, replace the stabilizer with\n\"iE(ai;bi)\u0001\"jE(aj;bj)(which commutes with E(c;d)).\nSee [9] for details on binary arithmetic for Paulis.\nLetj\b+\nniAB:=\u0010\nj00iAB+j11iABp\n2\u0011\nn\n=1p\n2nP\nx2Fn\n2jxiAjxiB.\nIt is well-known that this state is stabilized by S(j\b+\nniAB) =\nhXAXB;ZAZBi\nn. It is also known that j\b+\nniABsatisﬁes the\nfollowing matrix identity for any matrix M\nhXAXB;ZAZBi\nn. It is also known that j\b+\nniABsatisﬁes the\nfollowing matrix identity for any matrix M[4], [5]:\n(MA\nIB)\f\f\b+\nn\u000B\nAB= (IA\nMT\nB)\f\f\b+\u000B\nAB: (3)\nWhenMis a projector, one can replace MbyM2and\napply this property to only one Mto see that the operator\non the right hand side becomes MA\nMT\nB. Thus, projecting\nAlice’s qubits by Minduces a simultaneous projection of\nBob’s qubits by MT. In particular, when M= \u0005S, which is\ninduced by measuring the stabilizer generators of Son Alice’s\nqubits, Bob’s qubits are projected onto the subspace of the\n“transpose” code whose projector is \u0005T\nS. By transposing (2),\nit is clear that the stabilizer generators for this transpose code\naref\"iE(ai;bi)Tg, whereE(ai;bi)T= (\u00001)aibT\niE(ai;bi)\nbecauseYT=\u0000YbutXandZare symmetric.III. C ODE BASED ENTANGLEMENT DISTILLATION\nA. Bell Pair Distillation using Stabilizer Codes\nWe begin by using the stabilizer formalism to explain why,\nbefore the decoding step, the logical qubits of Alice and Bob\nformkBell pairs in the distillation protocol by Wilde et al. [5]\nthat we discussed in the Introduction.\nInitially, Alice generates the 2n-qubit stabilizer state\nj\b+\nniAB, which can be simulated by creating the stabilizer\ngroupS(j\b+\nniAB). This group has 2ncommuting generators,\ntwo for each Bell pair. Now, Alice chooses some [ [n;k;d ] ]\nstabilizer codeQ(S)and measures the r=n\u0000kstabilizer\ngenerators ofSon qubits marked ‘A’. We can use the stabilizer\nformalism in Section II to evolve the stabilizer group through\neach measurement. Crucially, the rules of the stabilizer formal-\nism guarantee that after each step the new set of generators\nstill mutually commute. Hence, after rsteps, we will have\nAlice’s code stabilizers belonging in the evolved group. Due\nto the Bell matrix identity in (3) (for projector \u0005S), we know\nthat Bob’s qubits would have been simultaneously projected\nonto the subspace of the “transpose” code. Thus, Bob’s code\nstabilizers must also belong to the evolved group, and we have\n2r= 2(n\u0000k)code sta\n. Thus, Bob’s code\nstabilizers must also belong to the evolved group, and we have\n2r= 2(n\u0000k)code stabilizer generators in total.\nThe Pauli error from the channel can only affect the signs\nof these stabilizers, which are assumed to be ﬁxed later by\nBob’s decoder. The remaining 2kgenerators of the evolved\ngroup mutually commute and also commute with all these\ncode stabilizers. Each of these 2koperators must act both on\nAlice’s and Bob’s qubits, and since they are not themselves\nstabilizers of the code, the Alice (resp. Bob) component of\neach operator must be a logical operator for Alice’s (resp.\nBob’s) code. With some thought, one can appropriately deﬁne\nlogicalXand logicalZoperators for the codes of Alice and\nBob to conclude that these 2koperators correspond to logical\nXAXBand logical ZAZBfor thekpairs of logical qubits.\nHence, in the Wilde et al. protocol, this is why the logical\nqubits of Alice and Bob form logical Bell pairs just before\nthe decoding step. When the encoding unitaries are inverted\non both parties, these logical Bell pairs are converted into\nphysical Bell pairs that are of higher quality than the nnoisy\nBell pairs initially shared between Alice and Bob. For a more\ndetailed discussion of this phenomenon, see [9].\nB. Multi-Qubit GHZ Distillation\nGiven this understanding of the Bell pair distillation pro-\ntocol, it is natural to extend it to distill `-qubit GHZ states, \f\f\fGHZ`E\n=(j00\u0001\u0001\u00010i+j11\u0001\u0001\u00011i)p\n2. The case of `= 3, the standard\nGHZ state, was recently solved in [9]. Here, we extend the\nprotocol to any `\u003E3and use`= 4for simplicity. Unless we\ninclude the superscript `,jGHZidenotes the 4-qubit state.\nConsiderncopies of the 4-qubit GHZ state where the\n4qubits of each copy are marked ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’.\nSimilar to the case of the standard Bell state, the qubits can\nbe rearranged to rewrite the joint state as\njGHZniABCD=1p\n2nX\nx2Fn\n2jxiAjxiBjxiCjxiD: (4)Each GHZ state has the following associated stabilizer group:\nSGHZ=hZAZBICID; IAZBZCID; IAIBZCZD; \n4)Each GHZ state has the following associated stabilizer group:\nSGHZ=hZAZBICID; IAZBZCID; IAIBZCZD; X AXBXCXDi:\nHence, the stabilizers for jGHZniABCD areS\nn\nGHZ. Next, we\nneed to generalize the Bell matrix identity (3) to the GHZ\ncase and identify how Pauli measurements on one subsystem\naffect the other subsystems. We begin with a simple lemma.\nLemma 1. LetM=P\nx;y2Fn\n2Mxyjxihyj2C2n\u00022nbe any\nmatrix acting on qubits ‘A’. Then,\n(MA1\nI)\f\f\fGHZ`\nnE\nA1\u0001\u0001\u0001A`=\u0010\nIA1\n\u0010dMT\u0011\u0011\f\f\fGHZ`\nnE\nA1\u0001\u0001\u0001A`;\n‘GHZ-map’ :M7!cM:=X\nx;y2Fn\n2Mxyjxihyj\n(`\u00001):\nProof: Similar to the Bell state case, we calculate\nMA1\f\f\fGHZ`\nnE\nA1\u0001\u0001\u0001A`=1p\n2nX\nx;y2Fn\n2MxyjxiA1jyiA2\u0001\u0001\u0001jyiA`\n=1p\n2nX\nx;yjxiA1(MT)yxjyiA2\u0001\u0001\u0001jyiA`\n=\u0012\nIA1\n\u0010dMT\u0011\nA2\u0001\u0001\u0001A`\u0013\f\f\fGHZ`\nnE\nA1\u0001\u0001\u0001A`\nThis completes the proof and establishes the identity.\nNext, we establish some properties of the GHZ-map, which\nare straightforward to prove (see [9] for proof of `= 3).\nLemma 2. The GHZ-map M2C2n\u00022n7!cM2\nC2(`\u00001)n\u00022(`\u00001)nis an algebra homomorphism [14]:\n(a)Linear: IfM=\u000BA+\fB, where\u000B;\f2C, thencM=\n\u000BbA+\fbB.\n(b)Multiplicative: If M=AB, thencM=bAbB.\n(c)Projector-preserving: If M2=M, thencM2=cM.\nConsider performing stabilizer measurements on Alice’s\nqubits. This corresponds to the case where M= \u0005Sfor some\nstabilizer groupS. The third property above clariﬁes that this\nalso induces a projection on the remaining qubits. However, we\nwant to understand whether it projects onto a stabilizer code\nand, if so, then we also want to know the structure of this\ninduced code. The above lemma greatly simpliﬁes this pursuit\nsince the code projector (2) is a product of sums. Note that\nwe seek to expandc\u0005T\nS, and that the transpose map commutes\nwith the GHZ-map. Due to the multiplicativity of the GHZ-\nmap, it is sufﬁcient to consider only the case r= 1 in\u0005S,\nwhere there is a single stabilizer generator \"E(a;b). Now, due\nto the linearity of the GHZ-map, we only need to determine\ncINand\\E(a;b), sinceE(a;b)T= (\u00001)abTE(a;b). Using this\napproach, we arrive at the following main technical re\na;b), sinceE(a;b)T= (\u00001)abTE(a;b). Using this\napproach, we arrive at the following main technical result.\nTheorem 3.

See [9] for the details.\nExample 1. Consider`= 3;n= 1 and the case when M=\nI+Z\n2=I+E(0;1)\n2, witha= 0;b= 1 =b1;b2= 0. Then,\nbI=I\nI+Z\nZ\n2and\\E(0;1)T= (E(0;1)T\nE(0;0))\u0001bI=\n(Z\nI)\u0001bI. Therefore, the stabilizers for BC are hZ\nI;Z\nZi.\nIf we had an X-measurement for ‘A’, where a= 1;b= 0,\nthenE(a;b)T\nE(a;0) =X\nX. Combined with the Z\nZ\nfrombI, the qubits on BC are projected to the Bell state.\nMore interestingly, if we consider a Y-measurement for ‘A’,\nwherea=b= 1, thenE(a;b)T\nE(a;0) =YT\nX=\u0000Y\nX. Thus, assuming the measurement result is +1, the new BC\nstabilizers areh\u0000Y\nX;Z\nZi. It can be veriﬁed that the post-\nmeasurement state for this case will be(j0i+{j1i)p\n2\n(j00i\u0000{j11i)p\n2,\nwhich is stabilized by the above stabilizer.\nRemark 4. There are two special cases that eliminate the sign\nin the new joint stabilizer. One can set b1=bandb2=b3=\n\u0001\u0001\u0001=b`\u00001= 0[9], like in Example 1, in which case bi\u0003bj= 0\nalways. More generally, one can deﬁne fbi:bi6= 0gsuch that\nbi\u0003bj= 0 whileb1\bb2\b\u0001\u0001\u0001\bb`\u00001=bstill holds, i.e.,\nsplitting the entries of binto(`\u00001)disjoint groups.\nAs we desired, the above result shows how a Pauli mea-\nsurement on one sub\ninto(`\u00001)disjoint groups.\nAs we desired, the above result shows how a Pauli mea-\nsurement on one subsystem, A 1, of (multiple copies of) the\nGHZ state affects the remaining subsystems. All the GHZ\nstabilizers involving subsystems A 2;A3;:::; A`are retained.\nHence, the post-measurement state is “GHZ-like” on these\n(`\u00001)subsystems but with an additional globally entangling\nstabilizer. This is akin to the globally entangling all- Xstabi-\nlizer for the standard GHZ state, but it depends on the Pauli\noperator being measured on A 1. Note that, since the Pauli\nmeasurement randomly projects onto a subspace, the induced\nstabilizers given by the theorem do not uniquely determine\nthe post-measurement state on the (`\u00001)subsystems. The\ndegrees of freedom for the state will be quantiﬁed shortly in\na more general setting. One might argue that this theorem\ncan be obtained by directly applying the stabilizer formalism\ntoSGHZ. However, some thought clariﬁes that arriving at the\nconclusions rigorously takes at least an equal amount of effort.\nIn the context of measuring a set of (n\u0000k)stabilizer\ngenerators of a code (on qubits A 1), the above result conﬁrms\nthat this induces a joint stabilizer code on the remaining (`\u00001)\nsubsystems. There are n(`\u00001)qubits on these subsystems andeach code stabilizer generator contributes a stabilizer generator\nfor this induced code. Besides, as stated in the theorem,\nthere aren(`\u00002)GHZ stabilizers on all pairs of adjacent\nsubsystems,fAjAj+1;j= 2;:::;`\u00001g, independent of the\ncode stabilizers being measured. Hence, the induced code has\n(n\u0000k) +n(`\u00002)stabilizer generators, which means it is\nan[ [n(`\u00001);k] ]code and the post-measurement state has\nklogical degrees of freedom. The minimum distance of the\ninduced code will depend on the minimum distance of the\nA1-code as well as the new GHZ stabilizers and the choice of\nfbig. In [15], for `= 3, only the special case of Theorem 3\nwithb1=b;b2=b3=\u0001\u0001\u0001=b`\u00001= 0 was considered.\nSince this leads to purely X-type stabil\nase of Theorem 3\nwithb1=b;b2=b3=\u0001\u0001\u0001=b`\u00001= 0 was considered.\nSince this leads to purely X-type stabilizers for the remaining\nsubsystems, a local diagonal Clifford operation was prescribed\nto ﬁx the stabilizers. Such techniques can also be applied in\nthe more general Theorem 3 based on the choices of bi.\nWe will now complete this paper with the overall description\nof the protocol. More details can be found in [9].\nC. The Distillation Protocol\nThe protocol is showed on the left side of Fig. 2 for `= 3.\nWe will restrict ourselves to CSS codes here, since most\ngood codes found in the literature are of this type. However,\nif necessary, the protocol can be generalized to arbitrary\nstabilizer codes using some additional details from [15], where\nthat initial protocol turned out to be less scalable.\nFor any`\u00153, A1generatesnideal copies of the `-qubit\nGHZ state, names the qubits of each copy A 1through A `,\nchooses some [ [n;k] ]codeQ(S)deﬁned by a stabilizer S,\nand measures the (n\u0000k)generators ofSon qubits A 1.\nThen, A 1applies Theorem 3 to determine the induced code\nQ\u0000\nS(`\u00001)\u0001\non the remaining subsystems. Let us again set\n`= 4for simplicity. For tracking the protocol, we can initially\ncreate a table whose rows are the binary representations of the\ngenerators ofS\nn\nGHZ(similar to [9]). Group the nZ AiZBiICiIDi\ngenerators in the ﬁrst part of the table, the n I AiZBiZCiIDi\ngenerators in the second part, the nI AiIBiZCiZDiin the third\npart, and ﬁnally the n X AiXBiXCiXDiin the fourth part. If\nthere is a purely Z-type generator, E(0;b)A, forS, then it\nwill commute with the ﬁrst three parts and only affect the\nlast part based on the stabilizer formalism. Moreover, by an\nappropriate linear combination of the rows of the ﬁrst part,\none can produce the element E(0;b)A\nE(0;b)B, which when\nmultiplied by the new code stabilizer produces the stabilizer\nE(0;b)Bon purely subsystem B. By a similar trick in the\nsecond part and subsequently in the third part, one can produce\nsingle-subsystem \nmilar trick in the\nsecond part and subsequently in the third part, one can produce\nsingle-subsystem stabilizers E(0;b)CandE(0;b)Das well.\nHence, it sufﬁces to only consider stabilizers E(a;b)A;a6= 0.\nSuch stabilizers transform into the multiple-subsystem sta-\nbilizers described by Theorem 3. Now, qubits of B, C, and D\nneed to be transmitted over a noisy channel to the respective\nnodes, based on the network topology. For those nodes to be\nable to correct errors, a code needs to be imposed purely on\neach subsystem before transmission of the respective qubits.\nLet A be connected to B. Then, based on the choice of\nb1;b2;b3in Theorem 3, Ameasures code stabilizers E(a;b 1)B0:100 0:101 0:102 0:103 0:104 0:105 0:106 0:107 0:108 0:109 0:1100:90:910:920:930:940:950:960:970:980:991\nDepolarizing ProbabilityGHZ Failure Rate[ [n= 544;k= 80;d= 12] ]\n[ [n= 714;k= 100;d= 16] ]\n[ [n= 1020;k= 136;d= 20] ]\nFig. 2: (left) QEC-based distillation protocol for GHZ states. (right) Threshold of the protocol on a lifted product code family.\non qubits B. With some thought, one sees that these stabi-\nlizers only affect the second part of the table. Now, since\n\u0006E(a;b 1)B\nE(a;b 2)C\nE(a;b 3)Dis already a stabilizer,\nby multiplying with E(a;b 1)Bwe obtain a code on B and a\nresidual code jointly on C and D. The qubits of B can be\ntransmitted to node B (along with necessary classical sign\ninformation of stabilizers), which can perform error correction.\nIf A is not connected to C and D, then A has to send those\nqubits to B. Thus, it appears that A has to perform stabilizer\nmeasurements as above not only on B but on C and D as\nwell. However, this can be relegated to subsequent nodes to\nreduce the burden on A. Let A also send qubits C and D\nto node B along with qubits B. There is some joint Pauli\nerror on B, C, and D, and the error correction of B only\nﬁxes the error part on B. If B measures code stabilizers on\nC, then the preexisting Pauli error can be transformed into\nan effective Pauli error after th\ners on\nC, then the preexisting Pauli error can be transformed into\nan effective Pauli error after the code was imposed on C.\nThis enables node C to correct this error as well as any error\nencountered while B sends qubits C. A similar statement holds\nfor D as well. Thus, the protocol can be stated as follows: for\nevery edge connected to a node, the node performs stabilizer\nmeasurements on the respective subsystem to impose a code\non the qubits of the recipient on that edge. The correctness\nof the protocol relies on carefully tracking signs of stabilizers\nbased on such measurements at each node. Once all qubits are\ndistributed, each node uses the logical Paulis of their respective\ncodes [9] to determine and invert the encoding unitary. This\nconverts the klogical GHZ states into kperfect physical GHZ\nstates, provided all error corrections were successful.\nIn Fig. 2 (right), we plot the threshold of the protocol for\n`= 3 on a family of lifted product codes under iterative min-\nsum decoding. A more detailed discussion can be found in [9].\nREFERENCES\n[1] H. J. Briegel, W. Dür, J. I. Cirac, and P.

This requires under-\nstanding the channel-induced degradations of the transmitted quantum signals, beyond the typical\ncharacterization methods for classical communication systems. Here we report on a comprehensive\ncharacterization of a Boston-Area Quantum Network (BARQNET) telecom fiber testbed, measur-\ning the time-of-flight, polarization, and phase noise imparted on transmitted signals. We further\ndesign and demonstrate a compensation system that is both resilient to these noise sources and\ncompatible with integration of emerging quantum memory components on the deployed link. These\nresults have utility for future work on the BARQNET as well as other quantum network testbeds\nin development, enabling near-term qua\nwork on the BARQNET as well as other quantum network testbeds\nin development, enabling near-term quantum networking demonstrations and informing what areas\nof technology development will be most impactful in advancing future system capabilities.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe continued development of networked quantum sys-\ntems [1] will support applications in distributed quan-\ntum processing [2–4], enhanced sensing [5–10], and se-\ncure communications [11–14]. Connecting these systems\nacross distances ranging from tens of meters to hundreds\nof kilometers requires the careful testing and integration\nof a range of quantum and classical technologies. Key\nchallenges are quantifying and overcoming the impact\nof channel-induced signal degradation and noise, which\ncan decohere transmitted qubits, constrain the repeti-\ntion rate of networking protocols, and limit the net-\nwork’s compatibility with various technologies [15]. For\nexample, timing drifts can degrade time-bin qubit sig-\nnals and limit the synchronization of distributed systems.\nAdditionally, optical phase fluctuations result in opti-\ncal frequency broadening that impedes the integration of\nnarrow-band technologies such as atomic-type quantum\nsystems. Finally, drifting polarization can degrade polar-\nization qubits and limit the performance of polarization-\nsensitive components.\nHere we report on measurements of these characteris-\ntics for a fiber network connecting MIT Lincoln Labora-\ntory (MIT-LL), MIT, and Harvard University, forming\na Boston-Area Quantum Network (BARQNET). Based\non this characterization, we design and demonstrate a\n∗Eric.Bersin@ll.mit.educompensation system that enables the transmission of\nphotonic time-bin pulses from MIT-LL across the fiber\nto Harvard with 97 .7% fidelity. We discuss the future\nuse of this compensation system and the BARQNET’s\npotential for supporting emerging quantum networking\nprotocols.\nFigure 1(a) depicts the BARQNET layout. Two\n42.5 km spans of single-mode telecom fibers connect\n\nls.\nFigure 1(a) depicts the BARQNET layout. Two\n42.5 km spans of single-mode telecom fibers connect\nMIT-LL in Lexington, MA to MIT’s main campus in\nCambridge, MA. From there, an additional two 7.9 km\nspans of single-mode telecom fibers connect MIT to Har-\nvard University, also in Cambridge, MA. All fibers are\ncommercial plants, comprising various combinations of\ncommercial SMF-28 fiber and non-zero dispersion shifted\nfiber that have been spliced together. Some of the fiber is\nburied, while other spans are above-ground on telephone\npoles. As a result, the link performance is below the\nideal achievable using a laboratory spool or a custom-laid\nfiber connection, but is instead representative of the per-\nformance expected over existing and available deployed\nfiber links that will make up many emerging quantum\nnetwork testbeds.\nThe three-node layout permits access to a number of\nconfigurations for both characterizing the fiber and per-\nforming quantum networking demonstrations. Fig. 1(b–\nd) depict three configurations explored in this work. The\nfibers can be used independently as in the Differential\nConfiguration (Fig. 1(b)); this can be used to send quan-\ntum information down one fiber and classical information\ndown another to avoid crosstalk [16, 17], or both can\nbe used for quantum information to simply increase thearXiv:2307.15696v2  [quant-ph]  5 Jan 20242\nFIG. 1. (a) Schematic of the BARQNET fibers connecting MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, MIT in eastern Cambridge,\nand Harvard University in central Cambridge. The solid red line shows a ∼40 km segment where the exact route is known,\nand the dashed line shows the final portion where the exact route could not be obtained. (b–d) Three different connectivity\ntopologies explored in this work. The two copropagating fibers connecting MIT-LL and MIT are labeled A and B, and the two\ncopropagating fibers connecting MIT and Harvard are labeled C and D.\nchannel bandwidth. Alternatively, connecting the fibers\nin the Round-\nd Harvard are labeled C and D.\nchannel bandwidth. Alternatively, connecting the fibers\nin the Round-Trip Configuration (Fig. 1(c)) provides a\nsingle 85 km span for testing protocols over longer dis-\ntances. This configuration is also comparable to what\nwould be used for two-way quantum information pro-\ncessing protocols, where a client sends data to a server\nwhich then returns a reply [18, 19]. Finally, the addi-\ntional fibers to Harvard can be utilized to realize a Three-\nNode Configuration (Fig. 1(d)), whereby both MIT and\nMIT-LL can transmit information to Harvard, which in\nthis topology serves as a central node. This configuration\ncan be used for a range of demonstrations, such as single-\nrepeater protocols [20–25] or multipartite entanglement\ngeneration [26, 27].\nII.

In particular, photon num-\nber [29], polarization [30], and time-bin [31] encodings\nhave seen wide-spread exploration for applications such\nas remote entanglement generation and quantum key dis-\ntribution. Transit over deployed optical fiber imparts\nnoise that will affect each of these modalities in different\nways, making it critical to understand the magnitudes\nand frequencies of these noise sources.\nFor example, modeling the performance of networked\nquantum systems with narrow atomic-resonance-based\nspectral acceptance windows can benefit from character-\nizing \nms with narrow atomic-resonance-based\nspectral acceptance windows can benefit from character-\nizing fiber-induced optical linewidth drift and broadening\ndown to kHz-class resolution [32]. Additionally, predict-\ning the performance of polarization-sensitive components\ncalls for characterizing fiber-induced polarization drift to\nsingle degrees, for example to keep error rates below 1%\nfor polarization-encoded qubits. Lastly, projecting how\ndesired GHz-rate communication protocols would per-\nform requires characterizing fiber-induced timing jitter\nto below one nanosecond.\nThis sort of characterization requires a stable and accu-\nrate common reference between nodes. This is straight-\nforward for polarization by using the direction of the force\nof gravity to define a common vertical axis, but is more\nchallenging for time and frequency. Easily accessible mi-\ncrowave synchronization signals such as GPS do not offer\nthe sub-nanosecond timing precision needed [33], and op-\ntical systems like the White Rabbit Protocol are typically\nlimited to 10 km [34]. High precision optical frequency\ndistribution systems are, at present, not feasible for use\nas a portable channel characterization system [35–37].\nInstead, we make use of the BARQNET’s reconfigurabil-\nity to characterize the fiber-induced degradation between\nnodes using only local references.\nOperating in the Round-Trip Configuration — where3\na characterization signal is sent along one fiber, applying\na noise operator ˆA, and returned along another, applying\na noise operator ˆB— enables the returned signal to be\ndirectly compared to the local reference which allows the\ncombined effect of both fiber spans ˆA·ˆBto be measured.\nAlternatively, operating in the Differential Configuration\n— where a characterization signal is sent along one fiber\nand a reference signal is sent along the other fiber — en-\nables measurement of the correlation of the two fibers’\ntransforms ˆAand ˆB. These sum and difference charac-\nterizations allow us\nlation of the two fibers’\ntransforms ˆAand ˆB. These sum and difference charac-\nterizations allow us to determine the expected effect of a\nsingle fiber span in our testbed. Table I provides the loss\nexperienced over each span used for all configurations at\n1550 nm and 1350 nm, the two wavelengths examined\nin this work due to their relevance for networking with\ndiamond silicon-vacancy centers.\nA. Optical phase and frequency noise\ncharacterization\nQuantum communication schemes that utilize a\nphoton-number-based encoding require links with known\nphase differences, necessitating active stabilization or\ntracking of the phase delay imparted by the optical fiber\non the signal [38–40]. Drifts in phase can also impart\nDoppler shifts on transported light, inducing a frequency\nshift that can degrade the coherence of sufficiently narrow\nbandwidth signals. We characterize this phase noise in\nboth the differential and round-trip configurations shown\nin Fig. 1(b–c). For this measurement, the transmitter\nis a single long-coherence-length laser, split by a 50:50\nbeamsplitter to permit comparison of the different tran-\nsit paths. For the Differential Configuration, these two\npaths are the two fibers; for the Round-Trip Configura-\ntion, one path is the full 85-km fiber loop, while the other\nis a short ( \u003C1 m) local span of fiber. For this measure-\nment, the receiver employs an optical pi-hybrid device\nthat performs an interferometric measurement of the op-\ntical phase difference ∆ ϕ(t) between two input paths.\nFigure 2 shows the raw phase drifts as measured in\nthe Differential (Fig. 2(a)) and Round-Trip (Fig. 2(b))\nConfigurations, downsampled to 50 kHz to remove noise\nfrom our measurement equipment (see Supplemental Ma-\nterial [41] for dates and times of all fiber characteriza-\ntion data). In both cases, the phase difference fluctu-\nates across many full 2 πcycles over the course of a sec-\nond. These findings are orders of magnitude larger com-\npared to results on buried fibers [39, 4\nec-\nond. These findings are orders of magnitude larger com-\npared to results on buried fibers [39, 42], demonstrating\nthe critical importance of the fiber environment to the\ndiffusion process. Due to the BARQNET’s fast phase\nfluctuations, any phase-sensitive quantum communica-\ntion protocol would require high bandwidth stabilization.\nFor example, a control circuit with a 3-dB bandwidth of\n650 kHz and 39◦phase margin was used to stabilize the\nBARQNET to a residual phase noise of 3 ×10−2radi-\nans [43].\nDifferentiating the phase drift signal provides a mea-\n0246810\nTime (sec)-50005001000Phase (cycles)Round-Trip(b)\n-20-1001020\nFrequency Shift (kHz)00.020.040.060.080.1Probability (1/kHz)(d)00.511.52\nTime (sec)-20-15-10-505Phase (cycles)Differential(a)\n-5 0 5\nFrequency Shift (kHz)00.10.20.3Probability (1/kHz)(c)FIG. 2.

Differentiating these data provides a mea-\nsurement of frequency shift over time. Due to the random na-\nture of these fluctuations, this shift is effectively a frequency\nbroadening, with a profile given by the histograms shown in\n(c) and (d), which are fit to Gaussian profiles (red) with vari-\nances VD= 1.72 kHz2andVR= 21.2 kHz2for the Differential\nand Round-Trip data respectively.\nsurement of the Doppler-induced frequency shift over\ntime: ∆ f=d∆ϕ(t)/dt.Due to the random nature of\nthese fluctuations, this shift is effectively a frequency\nbroadening, with a profile given by the histograms shown\nin Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 2(d) for the Differential and Round-\nTrip Configurations respectively. We model the probabil-\nity density function of an optical frequency shift ρ(∆f)\non a given fiber as resulting from a Brownian process:\nρ(∆f) =/parenleftbigg1√\n2πV/parenrightbigg\ne−∆f2/2V, (1)\nwhich has variance V. Our measurements then corre-\nspond to the sum ( ρRfor the Round-Trip Configuration)\na\nas variance V. Our measurements then corre-\nspond to the sum ( ρRfor the Round-Trip Configuration)\nand difference ( ρDfor the Differential Configuration) of\nthe distributions ρAandρB, which have a covariance\nC. From the data in Fig. 2(c–d), we can calculate the\namount of common-mode noise due to the two strands’\nco-propagation. Using the measured variance of the dif-\nferential optical frequency noise, VD= 1.72 kHz2, and\nthe measured variance of the round-trip optical frequency\nnoise, VR= 21.2 kHz2, along with the assumption that\nthe optical phase noise contributions from each single\n42.5 km fiber span have equal magnitude VˆA=VˆB≡V,\nwe can calculate the variance of the optical frequency\nnoise for each fiber span V= (VR+VD)/4 = 5 .74 kHz2,4\nas well as the covariance of the optical frequency noise\nfor the two fiber spans C= (VR−VD)/4 = 4 .88 kHz2.\nThe relatively strong covariance suggests that quantum\nnetworking applications requiring phase-stable links can\nbenefit from distributing phase references between nodes,\neven if the reference is distributed in a separate but co-\npropagating optical fiber. Importantly, in all cases, the\neffective frequency broadening is narrower than the band-\nwidth of typical quantum networking systems, which\nrange from 10 MHz-class [30, 31] to 10 GHz-class [44].\nThe good agreement between our data and the Brow-\nnian model suggests phase drifts are well-described by\na diffusive process. In this case, the variance Vis lin-\nearly proportional to the length of the fiber L. Our\nresult can thus be scaled to other fiber lengths in sim-\nilar environments by using the variance per unit length\nv= 133 Hz2/m.\nB. Polarization drift characterization\nPolarization is an attractive degree of freedom for en-\ncoding photonic qubits due to its ease of generation, ma-\nnipulation, and measurement. Furthermore, as a spa-\ntial degree of freedom, polarization measurements can in\nprinciple be absolute without requiring distribution of a\nreference across network node\nments can in\nprinciple be absolute without requiring distribution of a\nreference across network nodes. However, strain-induced\nbirefringence in optical fibers can lead to polarization\ntransformations which drift over time as the fiber envi-\nronment changes [45]. We characterize the drift in po-\nlarization transforms ˆApand ˆBpover the BARQNET,\nspecifically measuring the drift in the polarization sent\nin the Differential Configuration (in this case only sent\none-way along fiber A from MIT to MIT-LL), as well\nas in the Round-Trip Configuration (sent two-way from\nMIT-LL to MIT and back). Our transmitter is once again\na single long-coherence-length laser, and our receiver is a\npolarization analyzer which records the polarization vec-\ntor ˆpin terms of the Stokes parameters {S1, S2, S3}at a\nrate of 1 Hz.\nFigure 3(a) shows a characteristic trace of the polar-\nization over twelve hours, plotting the Stokes parame-\nters as measured by our polarization analyzer. We ob-\nserve high variability in the drift rate, with long periods\nof stability as well as periods of rapid fluctuation. To\nbetter understand the source of this variance, we mea-\nsured the polarization over the course of multiple days in\nboth configurations. We then calculate the drift in polar-\nization angle between successive measurements (spaced\n1 second apart), and determine a mean polarization an-\ngle drift rate ⟨˙Θ⟩by taking a rolling average over 10 min-\nutes. Figure 3(b–c) show the measured ⟨˙Θ⟩as a function\nof time for the Differential and Round-Trip Configura-\ntions respectively, alongside the average wind speed W\nrecorded outside of MIT-LL [46], showing a clear correla-\ntion between the two datasets.

To understand\nthe slight reduction of κRrelative to κD, we can con-\nsider that while the one-way measurement probes the\ntransformation ˆApˆp, the two-way measurement probes\nˆB−1\npˆApˆp. The modest reduction here thus suggests some\ncommon-mode polarization drift between the two fibers,\nsuch that ˆApis partially counteracted by ˆB−1\np.\nThese results indicate that the specific environment of\na given deployed fiber network will have a strong im-\npact on the polarization drift rate. Indeed, while our fig-\nures are comparable to those reported for links of similar\nlength and with similar amounts of unburied fiber [48],\nother demonstrations using fully-buried fiber have ob-\nserved significantly reduced polarization drift [42].\nC. Optical path length drift characterization\nFinally, we consider the drift in optical path length\nover the BARQNET, as measured by photon time-of-flight. Time synchronization between nodes is a core ca-\npability for any quantum network, in order to distinguish\nbetween temporally-multiplexed classical and quantum\ncommunication time bins, and in general to coordinate\nthe different stages of protocols. This capability is par-\nticularly important when encoding photonic qubits in the\ntime-bin basis [49], which can require sub-nanosecond\ntiming synchronization precision [50]. The time-bin basis\nhas seen popularity due to its resilience to noi\n synchronization precision [50]. The time-bin basis\nhas seen popularity due to its resilience to noise; because\nall time-bins will travel along a common path, any phase\nnoise in-transit will be global and thus not decohere the\nqubit [31, 51]. Furthermore, using time-bins with a single\npolarization and applying polarization filtering can con-\nvert such drifts from bit errors into efficiency losses. Since\nmost networking protocols have stronger constraints on\nbit errors (typically \u003C10%) than on losses, this can im-\nprove overall protocol performance using only modest po-\nlarization drift correction.\nThe time-of-flight τacross an optical fiber depends on\nthe length of fiber Land the optical index of refraction of\nthe fiber n, which are both dependent on the temperature\nT. As a result, changes in the path length are given by:\n∆τ= (αL+αn)τ0∆T, (2)\nwhere αLis the fiber’s linear thermal expansion coeffi-\ncient, αnis the temperature dependence of the fiber’s\nindex of refraction, and τ0is the nominal time-of-flight\nacross the fiber. We characterize the drift in τover the\nBARQNET by measuring the time-of-flight across the\nfiber. In the Differential Configuration, we compare the\ndifference in transit time across links AandB, which\nhas a nominal value of τD= 108 .4 ns. In the Round-Trip\nConfiguration, we measure the total time-of-flight refer-\nenced to transit across a short ( \u003C1 m) local span of fiber,\ngiving a nominal round-trip time of τR= 415 .045µs. In\nboth cases, our transmitter is a pulsed laser source gen-\nerated by electro-optic intensity modulation of a contin-\nuous wave laser, split as in the phase drift experiment to\nenable comparison between the two transit paths. Our\nreceiver is a fast photodiode connected to a time tag-\nger which records the difference in arrival time between\npulsed signals traveling each path.\nWe record the delay in transit between the two fibers\nmeasured in the Fig. 4(a) Differential Configuration rel-\native to τD, and the Fig. 4(b) Round-Trip \nmeasured in the Fig. 4(a) Differential Configuration rel-\native to τD, and the Fig. 4(b) Round-Trip Configuration\nrelative to τR. Below this, we plot the temperature mea-\nsured outside of MIT-LL. Figure 4(c–d) shows the re-\nsultant correlation, giving a linear fit of 33.9(2) ps/◦C\n(adjusted R2= 0.790) and 2.59(1) ns/◦C (adjusted\nR2= 0.965) for the Differential and Round-Trip Con-\nfigurations respectively.\nThe temperature dependence coefficients have ex-\npected values of αL≈0.5×10−6/◦C [52] and\nαn≈8×10−6/◦C [53]. Using these numbers and assum-\ning that our two fibers are nearly identical in terms of\nnominal values τ0as well as temperature experienced at\nany given time predicts a dependence of 3.6 ns/◦C over6\nthe 85 km Round-Trip Configuration. The closeness of\nthis value with our measured result indicates that the\ntemperature change measured at one end of the network\nis very close to that experienced by the fiber along its en-\ntire span, despite many sections being underground. This\nsuggests that for networks with multiple nodes within\ntens of kilometers, the temperature at a single node can\nbe used to predict the behavior of optical path length\nfor fibers throughout the network. Furthermore, the sup-\npression of path length drift by nearly two orders of mag-\nnitude for the Differential Configuration reveals that the\nassumption of identicality between the two fibers is rea-\nsonable to single percent levels of precision.\nIII. TIME-BIN QUBIT DISTRIBUTION\nPROTOCOL\nCognizant of the above noise sources experienced by\nlight on our deployed fiber link, we design a communica-\ntion scheme for transmitting quantum information that\nis resilient to the fastest noise sources, permits compen-\nsation for slower noise sources, and is compatible with\nthe operation of a quantum memory on the receiving\nend. Specifically, we target a protocol for quantum state\ntransfer in the three-node configuration from Fig. 1(b),\nwhere time-bin photonic qubits are sent from MIT-LL\n(Alice) and receive\nonfiguration from Fig. 1(b),\nwhere time-bin photonic qubits are sent from MIT-LL\n(Alice) and received and stored by a nanocavity-coupled\nsilicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond [54, 55] at Har-\nvard (Bob). With the addition of a third node such as\na second transmitter at MIT, this protocol has utility\nfor example in memory-enhanced quantum communica-\ntion [24]. For compatibility with the SiV quantum mem-\nory, we incorporate a frequency conversion setup between\ntelecom and visible wavelengths, described in Ref. [56].\nThe transmitter waveform for our scheme is depicted\nin Figure 5(a), and comprises a classical clock signal at\n1550 nm for timing synchronization, a quantum signal at\n1350 nm containing our photonic qubits, and a classical\nreference signal at 1350 nm for fiber noise compensation.\nOur photonic qubits are generated by attenuated coher-\nent state pulses. Light from a 1350 nm laser is split\nout, passed through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM)\nfor power and frequency control, then passed through\nan amplitude electro-optic modulator (A-EOM) which\ncarves pulses to form time bin qubits. Each pulse is a\nLorentzian with full width at half maximum Γ = 45 ns,\nand the time bins are spaced 144.5 ns apart, set to be\ncompatible with the low-bandwidth constraints of the\nSiV quantum memory [24]. After pulse carving, a phase\nEOM (P-EOM) encodes phases on each time bin. At\nthe receiver (Fig. 5(b)), these qubits are upconverted to\n737 nm using sum-frequency generation facilitated by a\n1623 nm pump laser [56] then measured on a time-delay\ninterferometer (TDI) matched to the spacing of our time-\nbins.\nFor timing synchronization, optical systems like the\nWhite Rabbit (WR) protocol [34] offer a flexible means ofsynchronizing network timing with 100 ps-class precision.\nHowever, the continuous-transmission nature of the WR\nprotocol demands high isolation to prevent cross-talk be-\ntween timing data and the co-propagating, single-photon-\nlevel qubits. Furthermore, our network’s high \nen timing data and the co-propagating, single-photon-\nlevel qubits. Furthermore, our network’s high loss is pro-\nhibitive for standard SFP transceivers, which can typi-\ncally tolerate no more than 20 dB of loss. We thus de-\nvelop a custom optical sequence that uses low-duty cycle\noptical pulses to both minimize quantum-classical cross-\ntalk by avoiding temporal overlap as well as lower the av-\nerage power necessary for achieving synchronization. We\ntransmit 1550 nm optical optical pulses (duration 100 ns)\nin a sequence that comprises a trigger pulse, followed by\na series of pulses (repetition rate 5 MHz) that communi-\ncate what portion of the experimental sequence should be\nperformed, such as data transmission or fiber noise com-\npensation. These “clock command” words are distinct\nfrom one another by at least two symbols, allowing us to\navoid sequence errors from packet loss. Such packet loss\nerrors are in practice rare due to our robust amplifica-\ntion scheme. Timing pulses are amplified to 14 dBm with\nan erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) before transmis-\nsion, and are amplified to 6 dBm with a second EDFA\non receipt. The detected signal is then further amplified\nwith a pulse amplifier to 5 V, providing a reliable, low-\njitter trigger signal. Comparing the natural pulse shape\nof our qubits with the pulse shape retrieved by triggering\noff our optical clock (Fig. 5(c)), we measure only 520 ps\nbroadening in time-of-arrival variance, well below the du-\nration of our qubit time-bins. This enables us to achieve\nnanosecond-level timing precision across our network de-\nspite the \u003E200µs transit time between each site, as well\nas perform on-the-fly coordination between transmitter\nand receiver sequencers [41].\nFinally, we also periodically distribute longer reference\npulses at 1350 nm, which serve two purposes. First, since\nour qubits are encoded in the time-bin degree of free-\ndom, fiber-induced polarization errors do not reduce the\nfidelity of our protocol. However, due \nee-\ndom, fiber-induced polarization errors do not reduce the\nfidelity of our protocol. However, due to the polarization-\ndependent nature of other receiver components such as\nfrequency conversion, single-mode nanophotonic devices,\netc., such drifts manifest as loss. A common solution is\nto perform periodic, automated polarization correction\nbased off a strong pilot tone of known polarization [57–\n59]. We periodically send a 10 second reference pulse\nof continuous 1350 nm light, during which time an au-\ntomated sequence rotates waveplates to compensate for\npolarization drifts, maintaining the desired polarization\nto within \u003C20◦. Second, the TDI used to measure our\nphotonic qubits has a small FSR around 7 MHz. As a\nresult, drifts in our 1350 nm or 1623 nm laser frequencies\n≥100 kHz or drifts in the TDI path length imbalance\n≥10 nm will cause percent-level phase errors that de-\ngrade our protocol fidelity. We passively dampen these\ndrifts by locking these two lasers to ultra low expan-\nsion Fabry-P´ erot cavities to ensure narrow linewidths\n(\u003C100 kHz) and by placing our TDI in a thermally and\nvibrationally isolated case.

The shape of our 1350 nm qubit pulses retrieved from autocorrelation\nmeasurements (blue) is nearly identical to the sh\n350 nm qubit pulses retrieved from autocorrelation\nmeasurements (blue) is nearly identical to the shape retrieved when triggering off our timing signal (green), with only a\n520 ps broadening in time-of-arrival variance. (d) Error rate of photonic qubit preparation and measurement in the X-basis\nover a 336 second transmission period. Since our photon-to-spin mapping scheme requires measurement of photonic qubits in\ntheX-basis, we characterize our encoding in this basis by sending |+⟩(blue) and |−⟩(green). This gives a mean state\npreparation and measurement error rate of 2.3%. We attribute the increase in error rate over time to drifts in the TDI\npolarization, which decrease interference contrast.\nlength of the TDI to compensate for any slow drifts. We\nperiodically send a 1 second reference pulse of continu-\nous 1350 nm light, during which time a locking sequence\napplies a voltage to stretch and compress a piezo spool in\nthe long arm of the TDI. This locking signal is gated by\nan acousto-optic modulator (AOM), allowing us to shift\nthe frequency of the lock signal relative to our qubit fre-\nquency. In this way, our feedback sequence locks the TDI\nto the quadrature point of the reference light such that\nour incoming qubits will interfere at the fringe maxima.\nThe piezo voltage is then held during the portion of the\nsequence when qubits are sent. A variable optical attenu-\nator (VOA) is used to increase extinction on the reference\nsignal during qubit transmission periods.\nTo benchmark the efficacy of our overall communica-\ntion system, we perform a send-and-measure experiment\nwhich is identical to the protocol performed for mapping\nphotonic qubits to an SiV [24, 56]. To test the full sys-\ntem of timing synchronization, polarization correction,\nand frequency distribution, Alice sends a string of qubits\nencoded in the X-basis {|+⟩,|−⟩}, along with all of the\naforementioned timing and reference signals. Here |+⟩\ncorresponds to a photon split equally into early and late\ntime\niming and reference signals. Here |+⟩\ncorresponds to a photon split equally into early and late\ntime bins, while |−⟩is the same state but with a πphase\nshift on the late bin. Figure 5(d) shows the result of\nmeasuring these qubits after they have traversed the full\nsystem — traveling across the 50 km deployed fiber linkfrom Alice to Bob, undergoing polarization correction,\nbeing upconverted, and interfering on the TDI. To isolate\nthe impact of our cross-fiber synchronization from other\nnoise sources like detector dark counts and noise from\nthe frequency converter, we send an increased number of\nphotons per pulse compared to a true secure QKD proto-\ncol, measuring mean photon number ⟨ˆn⟩= 0.0202(5) at\nthe point of detection. As shown in Fig. 5(d), we retrieve\na mean bit-error-rate of 2.3(6)% across the |+⟩and|−⟩\nstates, where the error rate is defined as the probabil-\nity to measure the opposite of the transmitted bit. We\nattribute the remaining error to imperfect interference\nvisibility of our TDI due to internal polarization drifts,\nwhich was observed to degrade over the timescale of this\nmeasurement, likely due to air currents and human move-\nment within the room. Importantly, this can be corrected\nby having a local polarization reference and correction\nscheme without modifying the cross-fiber transmission\nprotocol.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nOur results demonstrate that the BARQNET’s\nfundamental noise characteristics are suitable for a\nrange of future experiments. The low fiber-induced8\noptical frequency noise indicates compatibility with\nnarrow-bandwidth atomic-resonance-type quantum sys-\ntems down to kHz-class with all-local frequency stabi-\nlization and referencing. Its nanosecond-class time-of-\nflight variations occur slowly and predictably based on\nweather conditions, indicating that even with Hz-class\ncross-fiber synchronization, the BARQNET can support\nup to MHz-class quantum network clock rates. Its polar-\nization drift rates, even during high-wind periods, aver-\nage \nantum network clock rates. Its polar-\nization drift rates, even during high-wind periods, aver-\nage below 1 rad/sec, indicating that high fidelity polar-\nization stabilization can be achieved with ∼10-kHz-class\nstabilization system. These low-bandwidth requirements\nfor the classical support infrastructure leave the majority\nof the channel bandwidth available, allowing high duty\ncycle transmission of quantum signals.\nThe experiments reported here constitute a compre-\nhensive characterization of the relevant figures of merit\nfor quantum networking. Importantly, the application\nof these characterization techniques enables us to design\na high-fidelity photonic distribution system that is re-\nsilient to noise across the BARQNET. These techniques\nare of significance for the development of emerging quan-\ntum network testbeds [59–64], helping to both reveal\nwhat demonstrations are presently feasible and identify\nthe most impactful near-term improvements to both the\nquantum components and classical infrastructure. For\nexample, our results indicated that the fiber-induced\nphase and frequency noise, polarization drift, and path\nlength drift characteristics of our link are compatible with\nperforming many essential networking protocols over our\ntestbed. Indeed, we used these findings to guide the de-\nsign of a system that successfully integrates quantum\nmemories [56]. While more advanced demonstrations\nsuch as entangling two memories across the BARQNET\nare at present impeded by the high loss on fibers Aand\nB, these loss characteristics can be improved by replacing\nthe anomalously high loss fiber splices and cross-connects\nin our links, in principle lowering the loss from MIT-\nLL to Harvard down to the propagation loss limit near\n10 dB. With these considerations in mind, we are cur-\nrently working to interface multiplexed quantum memo-\nries at each node [65] as well as incorporating additional\nnodes into the BARQNET for system-level explorationof quantum networking protocols.\nACK\ng additional\nnodes into the BARQNET for system-level explorationof quantum networking protocols.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis material is based upon work supported by the\nNational Reconnaissance Office and the Under Secretary\nof Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force\nContract No. FA8702-15-D-0001.

POLARIZATION DRIFT MODEL\nWe model the fiber-induced polarization drift as resulting from a Brownian process. Here, the two-dimensional\nnature of polarization results in an angular drift rate ˙Θ that follows a Rayleigh probability distribution:\nρp(˙Θ) =˙Θ\nσ2pe−˙Θ2/2σ2\np, (S1)\nwhich has non-zero mean ⟨¯˙Θ⟩=σp/radicalbig\nπ/2. A possible mechanism for this drift is stress-induced birefringence, where\nthe stress stems from force applied by the wind. In this case, the standard deviation of the drift σpwould stem from\nvariations in the wind force, which have a standard deviation σF. As the force applied by a fluid to a surface is\nproportional to the fluid velocity squared, this implies proportionality to the standard deviation of the wind speed\nsquared, σF∝σ2\nW. Finally, σWis reported to be linearly proportional to the wind speed W[47]. Thus, a model of\nBrownian motion caused by variations in the wind speed should exhibit a relationship ⟨¯˙Θ⟩=κ×W2with a scaling\nfactor κ, which depends on physical parameters of the system such as the fiber stress responsivity, the area of the\nfiber bundle facing the wind direction, etc.\nFigure S1 shows the power spectral density of the polarization drift rate ˙Θ for the (a) Differential Configuration\nand (b) Round-Trip Configuration, along with a 20-dB-per-decad\nor the (a) Differential Configuration\nand (b) Round-Trip Configuration, along with a 20-dB-per-decade reference line (red dashed), the expected profile for\nnoise caused by a Brownian process. In both cases, this is taken over the entire time trace of the data, and thus does\nnot capture the differing dynamics observed under different wind speed conditions. Indeed, while the floor of the noise\nappears to follow the expected Brownian profile, there are large fluctuations in the spectrum at higher frequencies\ndue to the variation in the spectrum across the time trace. To explore the time-varying nature of this power spectral\ndensity, we also plot spectrograms for the (c) Differential and (d) Round-Trip Configurations, where in each case the\nsignal has been binned into 10-minute windows. Note that this binning limits the low-frequency resolution of the\nspectrograms to ∼2 mHz.\nS3. POWER SPECTRAL DENSITIES\nIn Figures S2–S3 we show the power spectral densities of the phase and time-of-flight drifts, respectively. These\nplots also provide a 20-dB-per-decade reference line (red dashed), the expected profile for noise caused by a Brownian\nprocess. The good agreement between this model and our spectra indicates that our drifts are well-described by\nprimarily Brownian processes.arXiv:2307.15696v2  [quant-ph]  5 Jan 20242\nFIG. S1.

We use a high -optical -quality and thin \n(~ 300 nm) diamond membrane, supported by a polycrystalline diamond frame, to realize \nfully suspended two -dimensional photonic crystal cavities with a high theoretical quality \nfactor of ~ 8×106 and a relatively small mode volume of ~2 ( λ/n)3. The cavities are fabricated \nin the membrane using electron -beam lithography and vertical dr y etching. We observe \ncavity resonances over a wide wavelength range spanning the telecommunication O - and S -\nbands (1360 nm -1470 nm) with Q factors of up to ~1800. Our method paves the way  for on -\nchip diamond nanophotonic applications in the telecommunicat ion-wavelength range.    \n  \n \n  2 \n  Photonic crystal (PhC) cavities with high quality ( Q) factors and small mode volumes ( Vs), \nhave attracted much attention because of their ability to strongly confine light in time and space. \nThe enhanced light -matter interactions offered by PhC cavities can be utilized for the study of \ncavity quantum electrodynamics [1], as well as for various photonic applications including on -chi\n \ncavity quantum electrodynamics [1], as well as for various photonic applications including on -chip \noptical interconne cts [2], nonlinear optics  [3], optomechanics [4], quantum infor mation processing \n[5], and sensing [6], and atomic physics [7]. Silicon (Si) is one of the leading materials to realize \nhigh-Q PhC cavities [8,9]  due to its high refractive index, mature fabrication process, and \navailability of wafers on insulator. However, Si -based PhC devices can suffer from t wo-photon \nabsorption and related free carrier absorption in the near -infrared region due to the relatively small \n~1.1 eV bandgap of Si [10]. To overcome this issue, various wide gap materials such as diamond \n[11], SiC [12], AlN [13], and Si 3N4 [14] have been investigated. Among them, single -crystal \ndiamond stands out because of its attractive optical  and physical properties: relatively large \nrefractive index (2.4), wide transparency window from the ultraviolet to far -infrared, high thermal \nconductivity ( ∼2200 W ∕ m ⋅K) and small thermo -optic coefficient (~10-5 K-1). So far, there have \nbeen many repor ts on PhC cavities fabricated in single -crystal diamond. Most of them are focused \non operation at visible wavelengths to enhance the interaction between light and diamond color \ncenters such as nitrogen -vacancy (NV) [15–18], silicon -vacancy (SiV) [19–22] and tin -vacancy \n(SnV) centers  [23,24] . Re cently, diamond PhC cavities operating at telecommunication \nwavelengths have been demonstrated and utilized for applications in optomechanics [25,26] , but \nthese works utilize one -dimensional (1D) PhC cavities.  \nWhile diamond 1D PhC cavities have been the workhorse of quantum -photonics for years, 2D \nPhC cavities may offer additional advantages. For example, the highest Q PhC cavities reported \nto date are realized using 2D PhCs ( Q~ 107) [9], more than  an order of magnitude larger than in \nthe case of 1D PhCs ( Q ~ 106) [8]. For cryogenic applications, 2D PhC cavities ca\ne larger than in \nthe case of 1D PhCs ( Q ~ 106) [8]. For cryogenic applications, 2D PhC cavities can offer better \nthermal conductivity and heat dissipation, which is one of the challenges that 1D structures are \ncurrently facing, particularly when operating at mK temperatures [27,28] . For optomechanics, 2D \nmechanical crystals used as phononic shields allow increased mechanical cavity Qs [29]. \nFurthermore, 2D structures enable easier integration with other on -chip functionalities, including \nacoustic control of color centers [30]. Finally, for nonlinear optics applications, the 2D approach \nalso allows more flexibility in designing cavity resonances for, e.g., the realization o f ultra -low \nthreshold Raman lasers [31], leveraging diamond’s strong Raman nonlinearity [32]. \nThe lack of the telecom -wavelength 2D PhC cavities in diamond could be due to difficulties \nassociated with the fabrication of high -quality and large -area, suspended, diamond planar \nstructures. For example, angle etching [11], one of the leading fabrication approaches, is not  \ncompatible with the fabrication of 2D PhCs due to the resulting characteristic triangular cross -\nsectional profile. Moreover, approaches based on thinning diamond plates (initial thickness of 5 -\n30 μm) to sub -micron -thick films by reactive ion etching (RIE)  [17,18,33]  often suffer from large \nthickness variations (so called “wedging”) due to non-uniform thickness of the starting, \nmechanically -polished material [17], ther eby hindering large -scale fabrication of PhC cavities in 3 \n diamond. Although ion slicing can produce large -area and uniform thin films [34–36], ion damage \nin these films and residual built -in strain induced by ion implantation are unavoidable [37]. \nRecently, quasi -isotropic etching [38,39]  has been also used to realize 2D PhC cavities in bulk \ndiamond [40]. However, this method requires long etch times to completely undercut larger 2D \nslab st ructures, and can introduce backside r\nres long etch times to completely undercut larger 2D \nslab st ructures, and can introduce backside roughness and the thickness variations of the slab.  \nIn this letter, we fabricate and characterize telecommunication -wavelength 2D PhC cavities in \na single -crystal diamond membrane (SCDM). We employ an ultra -thin and hom ogenous diamond \nmembrane fabricated by a combination of ion implantation, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) \novergrowth, and RIE [41]. With the SCDM, we develop a process, which only relies on standard \nelectron beam lithography and dry etching without additional undercut etching, to fabricate a fully \nsuspended 2D PhC cavity with a theoretical Q factor ~8×106 and V ~2 (λ/n)3. We measure \nfabricated PhC  cavities by a resonant scattering method, finding cavity resonances with Q factors \nup to ~1800 in the telecommunication O - to S-bands. Our results show the potential of developing \ndiverse diamond nanophotonic devices based on PhC cavities, especially at t elecommunication \nwavelengths, for various applications, including nonlinear optics and optomechanics.   \n \n \n  \nFig. 1.  (a) Schematic of our suspended 2D PhC cavity in a thin diamond membrane. (b) Detailed \ndepiction of the air hole shifts. The arrows indicate t he shifts of the colored air holes in the y \ndirection, with the magnitude of each shift color -coded (largest in dark red, smallest in bright \nyellow). The shifts are mirror -symmetrical with respect to the plane across the cavity center (white \ndashed lines).  (c) Calculated electric field ( Ey) profile of the fundamental cavity mode with a \ntheoretical Q factor of ~8×106. \n   \n4 \n We investigate a width -modulated line -defect PhC cavity [42], as schematically shown in Fig \n1(a). The PhC consists of a triangular lattice of air holes in a 300 nm -thick diamond membrane \n(slab) with  a line -defect waveguide formed by a missing row of air holes along the Γ –K direction. \nThe lattice constant ( a) ranges from 502 to 542 nm, and the a\n air holes along the Γ –K direction. \nThe lattice constant ( a) ranges from 502 to 542 nm, and the air hole radius ( r) is 135 nm. We \nintroduce shifts of the air holes (S A = 22 nm, S B = 16.5 nm, S C = 11 nm, S D = 5.5 nm) into the PhC \nwaveguide to form a cavity, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The tapered shifts of the air hole position along \nthe x-direction enable the realization of high Q factors even when the shifts are only applied to the \nair holes in the first row ad jacent to the PhC waveguide [42,43] . This cavity design is also \nadvantageous as it allows high Q factors and it is relatively insensitive to structural disorders such \nas variations of air hole positions and radii, compared to other conventional cavity designs such as \nL3, and H0 type cavities, except heterostructure cavities  [44]. For a = 542 nm and the slab \nthickness of 300 nm, we obtain a high theoretical Q factor of ~8×106 and a moderate V of ~2.15 \n(λ/n)3 for the fundamental cavity mode (wavelength λ = 1.52 μm, refractive index of the diamond \nslab n = 2.4). Note that an increase in the slab thickness to 400 nm results in a theoretical Q factor \nof ~1.2×107 without a large ch ange (\u003C 1%) in V (λ = 1.6 μm) . The obtained Q and V are comparable \nto values previously reported for 2D PhC cavities in diamond [45]. Figure 1(c) shows the \ncalculated electric field ( Ey) distribution of the fundamental cavity mode using a 3D finite -\ndifference time domain (FDTD) method.  \nThe cavity fabrication process is illustrated in Fig 2. A SCDM with a thickness of ~300 nm is \nprepared using a scalable fabrication technique previously reported in [41,46] . This technique \ninvolves a combination of He+ ion implantation and microwave plasma CVD overgrowth to form \na high -optical -quality, free -standing,  thin membrane from a single -crystal diamond substrate \n[34,41,47] . We use a thick polycrystalline diamond frame to support the fabricated membrane to \nenable its handling. The frame is firmly bonded to the SC\name to support the fabricated membrane to \nenable its handling. The frame is firmly bonded to the SCDM using diamond CVD overgrowth at \nthe edges so that there is no stress due to differential thermal expansion during processing. The \nremoval of the ion -damaged layer and thinning of the SCDM down to the desired thickness are  \nmade possible by oxygen -plasma RIE during the SCDM fabrication . The RIE process keeps a low \nroot mean square surface roughness of ~ a few nm  [41]. The typical thickness variation of the \nSCDM is ~100 nm/mm, which is mainly due to imperfect surface polishing after diamond CVD \novergrowth. We consider that the remaining thickness variation can be further improved by \noptimization of the p olishing process and technique [48]. We note that color centers such as NV \nand SiV  centers can be created in the SCDM via CVD growth [41] or ion implantation [49].  \nIn this study, we employ a high -pressure high -temperature Type 1b single -crystal diamond \nsubstrate as a seed for the CVD overgrowth step. Our SCDM is supported by a 300 μm-thick \npolycrysta lline diamond frame (1.2 mm × 1.2 mm) with nine circular windows (each has a \ndiameter of 240 μm) [Fig. 2(a)]. The pitch of the windows is 350 μm. It is noteworthy that we can \neasily customize the size of the diamond frame and the configuration of windows ( number, size, \nand shape) akin to that shown in [41]. The SCDM can be prepared with a dimension of 4 mm × 4 \nmm and the window size can be scaled up to ~ 1 mm × 1 mm without breakage of the membrane.  5 \n The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows an optical microscope image of one of the SCDM windows before \ncavity fabrication. For safer handling of the SCDM and frame during the fabrication process, we \nfirst bond the frame to a Si substrate using hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) [Fig. 2 (b)].  It is noted \nthat it is not necessary to use the Si carrier substrate for handling the SCDM. The use of a larger \nSCDM and frame can also allow easier handling.  Before sp\nor handling the SCDM. The use of a larger \nSCDM and frame can also allow easier handling.  Before spin -coating an electron beam (EB) resist \n(ZEP 520A), a 100 nm -thick S iN layer is deposited on the SCDM by plasma -enhanced chemical \nvapor deposition (PECVD) [Fig. 2 (c)]. We pattern arrays of the designed cavity into the resist by \nEB lithography followed by resist development using o -xylene [Fig.2 (d)]. The SiN layer serves \nas a hard mask and is etched by inductively coupled plasma -RIE (ICP -RIE) using sulfur \nhexafluoride (SF 6) and octafluorocyclobutane (C 4F8) gases  [Fig. 2 (e)]. After removing the EB \nresist, we use an oxygen -based ICP -RIE (ICP = 700 W, RF = 100 W, P = 1.3 Pa,  and T = 25℃)  \nto fabricate PhC cavities into the SCDM [Fig. 2 (f)]. Finally, we dip the SCDM and frame into \nhydrogen fluoride (HF) to remove the SiN  and HSQ layers. The final SCDM windows with \nsuspended PhC cavities [Fig. 2 (g)] are completed after the frame is detached from the Si substrate \nby HF.  For cleaning the sample surface, we also immersed the SCDM and frame into a piranha \nsolution (3:1 mixtur e of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) just after removing the SiN and \nAl2O3 layers.    \n \nFig. 2.

(g) Final structure with suspended 2D PhC cavities.  \n6 \n Figure 3 (a) shows an optical microscope image of one of the SCDM windows with a dense \narray of 2D PhC cavities. Approximately 50 devices (typical device area is ~350  μm2) are \nfabricated in one SCDM window. We fabricate ~250 devices in total into 6 windows on one SCDM. \nIt is possible to further scale up the number of the devices using larger SCDMs and windows.  We \ndo not see any significant breakage of the SCDM window a fter the cavity fabrication, suggesting \nour method allows fabrication of diamond nanophotonic devices across the whole SCDM area. \nThe color patterns on the SCDM window are likely due to bending of the membrane in conjunction \nwith thickness variations insid e the window.  The inset of Fig. 3(a) shows an enlarged view of a \nPhC cavity and a rectangular -shaped trench which is utilized to measure the slab thickness and \nconfirm that fabricated PhC cavities are still suspended after fabrication. Figures 3(b) and (c)  show \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of an array of the fabricated 2D PhC cavities and a \nzoom -in view of the cavity, respectively.   The thickness variation is measured to be ~ 25 nm over \na 240 -μm diameter window using SEM.  Among ~250 devices fabricated in 6 windows, \napproximately half of the devices can be used for optical measurements since the thickness of 3 \nwindows are thinner than the targeted thickness of ~300 nm due to a polishing -induced thickness \nvariation.   \n \n  \nFig. 3.

The image in (b) is taken at 75° stage tilt.  \n7 \n Next, we characterize the fabricated cavities in the SCDM window shown in Fig. 3 (a) at room \ntemperature using a resonant scattering meth\navities in the SCDM window shown in Fig. 3 (a) at room \ntemperature using a resonant scattering method [8,50] . The simplified optical setup is depicted in \nFig. 4 (a). We use a supercontinuum laser with a spectrum that spans from 410 nm to 2400 nm. \nThe optical output power of the laser is fixed to ~20 mW. The laser light is focused onto the sample \nby an objective l ens (OL) with a 100× magnification and a 0.5 numerical aperture. The reflected \nlight from the sample is collected via the same OL and sent to an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA, \nresolution ~0.2 nm). In order to extract the cavity signals from the reflected light, we use two linear \npolarizers that are set to be in front and behind a beam splitter. After fixing the polarization of the \nlaser light by the front polarizer, the reflected light is polarized orthogonal to the input light by the \nother polarizer, whic h eliminates the backscattered laser light. Figure 4(b) shows the reflectance \nspectrum of a fabricated cavity with lattice constant  a = 542 nm. The sharp resonance at 1470.1 \nnm likely originates from the PhC cavity mode spatially localized at the cavity ce nter, which is \nconfirmed by varying the location of laser excitation. To further investigate the observed cavity \nmode, we measure the a-dependence of the resonance wavelength. Figure 4 (c) shows the summary \nof the measured peak wavelength for PhC cavities with a varying between 502 and 542 nm. We \nobserve cavity resonances over a broad range of wavelengths from 1360 to 1470 nm. As expected \nfrom simulation (shown later), the resonance wavelength increases as a becomes larger, which is \nconsistent with observat ions from other PhC cavities [51,52] . Moreover, the experimental data is \nwell-matched to the calculated resonance wavelengths of the fundamental cavity mode. The \ncalculation is accomplished by FDTD simulations considering the measured air hole radius and \nslab thickness by SEM. These results suggest that the observed resonance \nsured air hole radius and \nslab thickness by SEM. These results suggest that the observed resonance originates from the \ncavity mode shown in Fig 1(c). In addition , we confirmed that PhC cavities with similar lattice \nconstants, fabricated in a different window, also exhibi t cavity resonances at telecommunication \nwavelengths.  To evaluate Q factors for our fabricated cavities, we fit the obse rved spectra with a \nLorentzian function, as shown in Fig. 4(b). While typical Q factors of our fabricated cavities are \nless than 103, the cavity shown in Fig. 4(b) supports our highest -measured Q factor of ~1800. This \nvalue is still much lower than our simulated value (~8×106), likely due to light scattering by \nstructural imperfections and/or optical absorption. To evaluate the variati ons of air hole positions \nand radii in the fabricated cavities, we fit the air hole edges in the SEM image of Fig. 2 (c) with \ncircles  [50]. By including the variations of the air hole positions (~5 nm standard deviation of x- \nand y-directions) and radii (~2.5 nm standard deviation) extracted from the SEM image into our \nFDTD simulations, we find the predicted Q factor reduces to ~8×104, which is still higher than the \nexperimentally measured Q factors. This suggests that other fabrication imperfections, such as the \nsurface roughness of the slab, sidewall roughness, and tilt of the air holes likely play a significant \nrole [53]. Note that the measured fluctuations of air hole positions and radii could be much smaller \nsince extracted values contain the influence of charging in SEM measurements. We also noticed \nthat there are tiny etch pits and undetermined contamination on the surface of the thin membrane, \nas seen in Figs. 3 (a) -(c). We suspect that this co uld induce additional undesired scattering loss \nand optical absorption. We believe that further optimization of the fabrication process and the use \nof surface cleaning techniques [54] can improve experimental Q factors in the \n process and the use \nof surface cleaning techniques [54] can improve experimental Q factors in the future.  8 \n  \nFig. 4.

(c) \nExtract ed cavity resonances by fitting (blue dots) as a function of lattice constant a. The black \nsolid line shows the simulated resonance wavelengths by the FDTD calculations.   \n \nIn summary, we demonstrated telecommunication -wavelength 2D PhC cavities in a thin s ingle -\ncrystal diamond membrane. The 2D diamond PhC cavities can support a high theoretical Q factor \nof ~8×106 and a relatively small V of ~2 ( λ/n)3. We developed a fabrication process using only \nstandard EB lithography and top -down RIE for fabricating the cavities on the suspended thin \ndiamond membrane. By resonant scattering spectroscopy, we observed cavity modes at \nwavelengths between 1360 and 1470  nm (telecommunication O - and S -band) with Q factors up to \n1800. Our fabrication technique using thin diamond membranes could enable large -scale \nfabrication of nanophotonic devices for various diamond -based photonic applications, involving \nnonlinear optics , optomechanics and sensing. In particular, high -Q diamond 2D PhC cavities at \ntelecommunication wavelengths could lead to low -threshold Raman lasers [31,32] , optical \nparametric oscillators [55], or optical frequency converters [56].   \n9 \n  Acknowledgments  \nWe would like to thank Professor Iwamoto for his technical support.

This region where the distance-\nindependent rate occurs is the super-critical region of a new\npercolation problem. We extend this GHZ protocol to incorporate\na time-multiplexing blocklength k, the number of time slots over\nwhich a repeater can mix-and-match successful links to perform\nfusion on. As kincreases, the super-critical region expands. For a\ngiven (p;q), the entanglement rate initially increases with k, and\nonce inside the super-critical region for a high enough k, it decays\nas1=kGHZ states per time slot. When memory coherence time\nexponentially distributed with mean \u0016is incorporated, it is seen\nthat increasing kdoes not indeﬁnitely increase the super-critical\nregion; it has a hard \u0016-dependent limit. Finall\nng kdoes not indeﬁnitely increase the super-critical\nregion; it has a hard \u0016-dependent limit. Finally, we ﬁnd that\nincorporating space-division multiplexing, i.e., running the above\nprotocol independently in up to ddisconnected network regions,\nwheredis the network’s node degree, one can go beyond the 1\nGHZ state per time slot rate that the above randomized local-\nlink-state protocol cannot surpass. As (p;q)increases, one can\napproach the ultimate min-cut entanglement-generation capacity\nofdGHZ states per slot.\nIndex Terms —Quantum networks, entanglement routing, time-\nmultiplexing, GHZ projections, percolation\nI.

Quantum networks are composed of fundamental building\nblocks called quantum repeaters , which are special purpose\nquantum computers that can store qubits (entangled, e.g., with\nqubits at neighboring repeaters) in a local quantum memory\nregister, and perform quantum logic and measurements on\nsets of locally-held qubits. It is well known that, without\nthe assistance of quantum repeaters, the shared entanglement\ngeneration rate drops exponentially with the distance between\ncommunicating parties [1], [2]. Several attempts have been\nmade to improve the rate-versus-distance scaling starting with\nideal as well as noisy Bell states generated across network\nlinks, followed by measurements performed at repeater nodes\nusing local link state information, aimed at lengthening the\nreach of entanglement as well as to purify entanglement across\nlinks or multiple hops. In this paper, we will be \nnglement as well as to purify entanglement across\nlinks or multiple hops. In this paper, we will be concerned with\nquantum switches , but will continue to call them a repeater.\nA quantum switch is a repeater that has the capability of\nchoosing which links to fuse, based on instantaneous network\nstate information, dynamically.\nWith ideal two-qubit maximally-entangled Bell states gen-\nerated with probability pacross each network in each time\nslot and repeaters allowed to perform Bell State Measurements\n(BSMs) that succeed with probability q, [3] showed that the\npath diversity (multi-path routing) afforded by the network\nimproves the exponent of the exponential rate-distance scaling\nover what is achievable when the network routes entanglement\nover a pre-determined path. However, the rate still decays\nexponentially even with global link state knowledge as long\nasq \u003C 1. Ref. [4] showed that time multiplexing over a\nlinear chain of repeaters, i.e., allowing a repeater node to\nwait for blocks of ktime slots before deciding the pairs of\nqubits (within that time block) to be attempted to be fused\n(using BSMs), with an optimally-chosen kcan achieve a sub-\nexponential entanglement rate-vs.-distance scaling.arXiv:2108.09352v2  [quant-ph]  24 Aug 2021For the case when link-level Bell states have sub-unity\nﬁdelity, ref. [5] designed a quantum repeater architecture that\nuses multiplexing and a photonic switchboard to maximize the\ntradeoff between the shared entanglement rate and the ﬁdelity\nof ﬁnal entangled state. Ref. [6] on the other hand optimized\nthe length of time that quantum memories should hold onto\nnoisy Bell states to maximize the rate. Ref. [7] performed an\nextensive numerical optimization of the scheduling of puriﬁca-\ntion and BSMs to maximize the distillable entanglement rate,\ngiven a target ﬁdelity for the ﬁnal shared entanglement state.\nFollowing the intuition of [4], ref. [8] evaluates the beneﬁts\nof time-multiplexing in a two-dimensional quantum network.\nThis pap\n, ref. [8] evaluates the beneﬁts\nof time-multiplexing in a two-dimensional quantum network.\nThis paper extends the multi-path entanglement routing proto-\ncol presented in ref. [3] by allowing quantum memories to hold\nonto entangled qubits for multiple time-steps before deciding\nwhich qubit pairs to perform BSMs on. In the absence of\nquantum memory decoherence, time multiplexing can only\nhelp bridge the gap between the rate obtained using local\nlink state knowledge and that obtained using global link state\nknowledge. When the BSM success probability q\u003C1, as the\nmultiplexing block length increases, the obtainable rate mono-\ntonically increases. When memory decoherence is accounted\nfor, the rate increases until some optimal time-multiplexing\nblock length is reached, and then proceeds to decrease. In\nboth cases there are regions of the parameter space ( p,q,\nand multiplexing block length k) where this dynamic local-\nlink state knowledge based routing protocol can outperform\nsimply routing over the predetermined shortest paths between\nend-consumers.\nAll of the above papers achieve rates that decrease with\nthe distance between the communicating parties. In [9] how-\never, it was shown that if repeaters are allowed to perform\nGHZ joint projective measurements (on 3or more qubits),\nthen in a certain (p;q)region—determined by the critical\nthreshold of a modiﬁed site-bond percolation problem—the\nentanglement rate does not decay with the end-to-end distance.\nThis paper aims to improve the maximum entanglement of\nthe protocol described in [9] by employing time-multiplexed\nGHZ projections, as well as spatial-division multiplexing. Our\nintent is to quantify the regime of the parameter space, i.e., p,\nthe probability that a network edge establishes a (noiseless)\nBell state across it successfully in each time slot, q, the\nprobability that an attempted GHZ measurement succeeds, and\nk, the time-multiplexing block length, which affords distance-\nindependent entanglement rate. As the ne\nthe time-multiplexing block length, which affords distance-\nindependent entanglement rate. As the network has to wait\nforktime steps before the entangled state is shared between\nthe consumers, the entanglement rate is deﬁned as no. of\nshared entangled states generated per time slot and not ebits/s.\nWe employ two techniques to realize these improvements:\n(a) time-multiplexing to attain distance-independent rate for\npoorer (p;q)parameters, and (b) spatial-division multiplexing\nto increase the maximum achievable rate. We also study the\nperformance of the time-multiplexed protocol for the case that\nquantum memories are non-ideal and have ﬁnite coherence\ntimes that are exponentially-distributed with a known mean.\nThis paper serves as a guidebook to determine the degree oftime-multiplexing needed to achieve distance independent rate,\nbut not use too high a konce inside the percolation region so\nas not to be faced with the 1=krate penalty measured in end-\nto-end entangled states generated per time slot, & decide if\nspatial multiplexing is needed, given the knowledge of pand\nq.\nFinally, all mention of ‘qubit’ in this paper should be\ninterpreted as being logical (error-corrected) qubits, and not\nphysical qubits. This is because loss on a logical qubit can be\nheralded with the error-detection and error-correction property\nof a quantum code. This is an important assumption in\nmodeling assumptions inherent in this paper. More discussion\non this aspect will appear in Section III.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. We start with a\ndiscussion of the time-multiplexed version of the GHZ mea-\nsurement based protocol in Section II-A followed by the per-\ncolation problem the protocol translates to in Section II-B. The\nsimulation results for the protocol are analysed in Section II-C.\nWe relax the ideal quantum memory assumption made in\nSection II-A to discuss how the ﬁnite memory coherence times\naffect the rates and the optimal degree time-multiplexing in\nSection III. We discu\ny coherence times\naffect the rates and the optimal degree time-multiplexing in\nSection III. We discuss the spatially multiplexed version of the\nprotocol in Section IV, where we subdivide the network into\nspatially-disconnected regions while employing our protocol\nindependently within each region, to achieve entanglement rate\nthat approaches the ultimate capacity, the min-cut rate [10], for\nthe underlying network topology. We conclude by summaris-\ning the main results in Section V. The code used to generate\nthe simulation results is available at [11].\nII. T IME-MULTIPLEXED GHZ- PROJECTION BASED\nENTANGLEMENT ROUTING\nIn this section, we introduce our time-multiplexed protocol\nwhere nodes perform up to n-qubit GHZ measurements, with\nqubits chosen over ktime slots. We term this the (n;k)-\nGHZ protocol. We describe the protocol, present simulated\nentanglement rates for a square grid network, followed by a\nnew percolation problem our protocol maps to.\nLet us begin with a few deﬁnitions. An n-qubit maximally\nentangled state of the formj0i\nn+j1i\nn\np\n2is referred to as the n-\nGHZ state, which includes the Bell statej00i+j11ip\n2, as a special\ncase (n= 2). There are 2nmutually-orthogonal n-GHZ states,\nforming an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space spanned by\nnqubits. Two fundamental quantum operations that are used\nin our entanglement-routing protocol, are as follows:\n(1)n-fusion —This is a probabilistic operation, which when\nsuccessful, implements a joint projective measurement on n\nqubits (held at a repeater node) in the aforesaid n-GHZ basis.\nWe assume that the n-fusion measurement projects the n\nmeasured qubits on to one of the 2nGHZ states,j0i\nn+j1i\nn\np\n2.\nThis does not result in a loss of generality, since if the n-fusion\nhappens to project the nqubits on to any of the other 2n\u00001\nn-GHZ states, one can apply local single-qubit Pauli unitary\noperations to bring the post-measurement state to the one\nobtained when the fusion projects on to the aforesaid standardn-GHZ stat\neasurement state to the one\nobtained when the fusion projects on to the aforesaid standardn-GHZ state. A 2-fusion is same as the BSM. An n-fusion can\nbe used to fuse nentangled states, e.g., cluster states, each with\nm1;m2;:::;mnqubits respectively, into one entangled state\nwithm=Pn\ni=0mi\u0000nqubits. If the constituent entangled\nstates are each GHZ states, the resulting fused state is an m-\nGHZ state. The failure of an n-fusion attempt (on nqubits\nwithin a memory register at a given repeater) is taken to mean\nthat all of those nqubits are measured in the Pauli-X basis\nindependently, and the (binary) results of those measurements\nare known to that repeater, and are communicated to Alice\nand Bob at the end of each k-time-slot block.\n(2)Pauli-X basis measurement —When performed on one\nqubit of an n-GHZ state, an Xbasis measurement removes\nthat qubit from the GHZ state, resulting in an n\u00001GHZ state.\nThis operation is used to trim the shared entangled state such\nthat only the communicating parties (the ‘consumers’) have\nqubits left over that are (potentially) entangled at the end of\neach round of the protocol. Pauli-X basis measurements are\nalso used to model fusion failures as mentioned above.\nA. The time-multiplexed entanglement-routing protocol\nWe consider a quantum network with repeaters placed at\nnodes. The network topology can be a regular lattice such\nas a square-grid or hexagonal, or a random network of a\nknown node-degree distribution, such as the conﬁguration\ngraph [12]. We refer to a shared Bell pair,j00i+j11ip\n2between\ntwo neighboring repeater nodes as a link. In each time slot, of\nlength\u001Cseconds, an attempt is made to create a link across\nevery network edge; it succeeds with probability p. The two\nqubits of a link are stored in quantum memory registers at the\ntwo nodes sharing the edge, if successful. The knowledge of\nthe success-failure of each link takes time \u001CL=L=c seconds,\nfrom the time when the entanglement attempt is initiated, to\narrive at the nodes shar\nL=L=c seconds,\nfrom the time when the entanglement attempt is initiated, to\narrive at the nodes sharing that edge. Here, L(meters) is the\nphysical distance of the network edge, and cis the speed of\nlight.\nWe deﬁne the time-multiplexing block length ,k, as the\nnumber of time-steps a repeater waits—in accumulating qubits\nentangled with neighboring nodes—before attempting fusions\non a subset of the qubits accumulated, whose success-failure\noutcomes have arrived at the node. Fusions are destructive\nmeasurements. Performing an n-fusion thus frees up nqubit\nslots in the memory register at the node. It should therefore\nbe evident that at any given point in time, each repeater node\nholds between d(d\u001CL=\u001Ce)andd(d\u001CL=\u001Ce+k)qubits, where\ndis the node’s degree ( d= 4 for a square-grid network).\nEvery repeater can perform one- and two-qubit unitary\noperations and Pauli basis measurements on qubits held in\nits memory register. Fig. 1 depicts a k= 3link-snapshot over\na square-grid network. The line segments denote successful\nlink attempts over a 3time slot block. The blue dots represent\nqubits. In this section, we assume that the quantum memory\nregisters are ideal in the sense that the qubit coherence time\nis much larger than \u001CL+ (k\u00001)\u001Cseconds.\nIn our (n;k)-GHZ protocol, depicted schematically in\nFig. 1, at the end of each block of ktime slots, nodes other thanAlice or Bob, the communicating parties (the ‘consumers’),\nperform fusions on groups of (up to n) qubits, to expand\nthe reach of the shared entanglement across the network. The\nrules for picking the fusion groups are described below. Each\nrepeater acts based on local link state knowledge, i.e., the\nlink success-failure outcomes on its neighboring edges. Fusion\noutcomes are independent events, each with probability of\nsuccessq.\nLet us usedto denote node degree. For a square-grid net-\nwork,d= 4. We will evaluate the performance of the (n;k)-\nGHZ protocol described below, on the square-grid network,\nforn= 3 andn= 4.\n\u000FA repeater ra\nthe (n;k)-\nGHZ protocol described below, on the square-grid network,\nforn= 3 andn= 4.\n\u000FA repeater randomly picks one successful link across\nneighboring edges, over one ktime slot block, into groups\nof (at least 2and at most min(d;n)) qubits to attempt\nfusions on. It repeats the process until there are no more\nlinks across two (or more) distinct neighbors. All links\nwithin thek-slot block are treated as equal in forming\nfusion groups, i.e., qubits of a link do not get preferential\ntreatment based on the time-slot they were created in.\n\u000FEach group of qubits to fuse must be entangled with\nqubits across distinct neighboring edges.\n\u000FA repeater maximizes the number of n-fusions that\ncan be performed with the available links, followed by\nmaximizing (n\u00001)-fusions, and so on.\n\u000FQubits that are not part of any fusion group at a node are\nremoved by performing Pauli-X basis measurements.\n\u000FThe measurement results of each of the single-qubit\nPauli-X measurements and the multi-qubit fusion mea-\nsurements are communicated to Alice and Bob at the end\nof each time slot.\nAll fusion measurements and Pauli-X measurements at\nrepeater nodes commute with one another. Hence they can be\nperformed without coordination, yet synchronously, in each\ntime slot, based on the protocol described above that uses\nlocal link-state information. Because all the qubits across the\nnetwork in any k-time-slot block are measured (and hence\ndestroyed), either with fusion or Pauli-X measurements, at the\nend of each block of ktime slots, Alice and Bob end up with\npotentially one or more shared GHZ states involving qubits\nthat are held at Alice’s and Bob’s local memory registers. We\ndeﬁne the entanglement generation rateas the number of GHZ\nstates shared divided by k, expressed in the unit of GHZ states\nper time slot . Note that when k= 1, i.e., the (n;1)-GHZ\nprotocol reduces to the n-GHZ protocol as presented in [9].\nB. Mapping our protocol to a mixed-percolation problem\nLet us consider our time-multiplexed (n;k)-\n.\nB. Mapping our protocol to a mixed-percolation problem\nLet us consider our time-multiplexed (n;k)-GHZ protocol\non a quantum network with an underlying topology given by\na graphG= (V;E)deﬁned over a vertex set Vand edge\nsetE. The link success probability per time slot p, and the\nsuccess probability of each n-fusionq, translate respectively\nto effective bond and site occupation probabilities of a site-\nbond (mixed) percolation problem. The number of shared\nGHZ states after the measurements are performed at the\nend of each k-time-slot block equals the number of disjointFig. 1. Schematic depiction of a random snapshot of our (n;k)-GHZ protocol\nwithk= 3 over a square-grid quantum network. The black squares are\nquantum repeater nodes and blue dots are qubits held within an ideal quantum\nmemory register within the nodes. Entanglement links (two-qubit Bell pairs)\nare shown using black lines. In each time slot, a link is successfully established\nacross each network edge with probability p. The lines connecting qubits\nwithin a node illustrate fusion groups. Fusions are attempted within each\nnode, based on local link-state information after each subsequent k-time-slot\nblock. Each fusion attempt succeeds with probability q. The maximum number\nof qubits that can comprise a fusion group is n. The repeaters shaded green\nand grey show instances of fusion-group formations within a node, for the\n(3;3)-GHZ and (4;3)-GHZ protocols, respectively.\nsubgraphs shared between qubits held by Alice and Bob, in a\ngraph whose nodes are individual qubits and whose edges are\nentangled links across network edges and edges drawn among\nqubits of fusion groups within repeater nodes as depicted in\nFig. 1 [9]. In the appendix, we present a graphical construction,\nwhich shows that employing time multiplexing (i.e., k \u003E 1)\nsimply changes the lattice on which this mixed-percolation\nproblem is deﬁned on. The percolation rules remain the same\nas those for the non-time multiplexed protocol described in [9].\ne percolation rules remain the same\nas those for the non-time multiplexed protocol described in [9].\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the critical boundaries for the site-bond\npercolation induced by the ( 4;k)-GHZ protocol with increas-\ning time-multiplexing block length k. The entanglement gen-\neration rate does not scale with distance in the super-critical\nregion, i.e., above the critical boundary. The entanglement\nrate decays exponentially with the distance between Alice and\nBob on the other side of the critical boundary. Increasing k\nexpands the super-critical region, and hence affords distance-\nindependent rates with progressively lower (p;q)values than\nis possible with the k= 1 protocol in [9]. Increasing k\nindeﬁnitely would in principle indeﬁnitely expand the critical\nboundary outwards. However, after k= 7or so, for the square-\ngrid topology, we notice diminishing returns of increasing k\nfurther. Further, the maximum kthat can be supported would\ndepend upon the maximum quantum memory coherence times.\nRecall that a coherence time of d\u001CL=\u001Ce+ (k\u00001)times slots\nFig. 2. The critical boundaries of the site-bond percolation problem induced\nby our (4;k)-GHZ protocol, on the square-grid network, for k= 1;2;7\nand8. The curves are not sufﬁciently smooth due to ﬁnite-size effects of our\nsimulations. To generate each simulated point shown, we average over 50runs\nof a Newman-Ziff [13] algorithm variant over a 100-by-100 square-grid.\n(or this times \u001Cseconds) is necessary to support our protocol.\nWe observed that our described method to choose fusion\ngroups at repeater nodes results in a larger super-critical region\ncompared to a protocol that randomly groups links at a node\nwithout trying to maximize the number of n-fusions. However,\nwe also believe that an improved version of our protocol is\npossible that time-orders link successes akin to [4].\nC. Simulation results\nAll simulation results reported are for the ( 4;k)-GHZ proto-\ncol over the square-grid network, unless speciﬁed otherwise.\nW\neported are for the ( 4;k)-GHZ proto-\ncol over the square-grid network, unless speciﬁed otherwise.\nWe observed qualitatively similar trends for the ( 3;k)-GHZ\nprotocol, but with admittedly smaller percolation regions than\ntheir ( 4;k) counterparts. In Fig. 3, we plot entanglement rate\n(in units of shared GHZ states between Alice and Bob, per\ntime slot) as a function of link success probability p(fusion\nsuccess probability q) for different values of fusion success\nprobability (link success probability), both for the ( 3;k)- and\n(4;k)-GHZ protocols, for the cases of k= 2 andk= 8. As\nexpected from the percolation regions shown in Section II-B,\nwhenkgoes from 2 to 8 the values of pandqwhere a\nsudden jump occurs in the rate decrease. This sharp transition\nin the rate at certain values of pandq, and then saturating\nto a constant is an essence of percolation. In the ﬂat region\nof the rate plots, the rate does not change with the distance\nbetween Alice and Bob. Below the percolation transitions, the\nrate diminishes exponentially with distance. The (p;q)pair at\nwhich the rate plots transition to a constant lie on the site-bond\ncritical curve for that kvalue in Fig. 2. If we keep increasing\n(p;q)while keeping kconstant, the rate always saturates at\n1=kGHZ states per time slot. This is because increasing\n(p;q)beyond the transition point pushes the network deeper\ninto the super-critical region, where there exists with high\nprobability one unique giant connected (spanning) componentshared between the qubits of Alice and Bob. As a result, in\nthis region, at most one GHZ state is shared between the\nconsumers at the end of each k-time-slot block, resulting in\nthe rate of 1=kGHZ states per time slot. We observe that\ntime multiplexing gets rid of the ‘turn around’ in the rate that\nwas observed for the 3-GHZ protocol in [9]. The turn around\noccurs in the (3;1)-GHZ protocol on the square grid network\nin [9] because if at least one of the two neighboring repeaters\nhas four successful li\n grid network\nin [9] because if at least one of the two neighboring repeaters\nhas four successful links, the repeater(s) with four links may\nnot choose the link shared with the other repeater for fusion\nwhile the other repeater uses the shared link for fusion. This\nrandom selection rule ends up effectively disconnecting the\ntwo repeaters. However, for the (3;k)-GHZ protocol, when\nk\u003E2, the repeaters can perform multiple fusions. As a result,\nthe link which was left unused in the (3;1)-GHZ protocol\nnow gets used to in some other fusion with a high probability,\nkeeping the network connected.\nWe keep (p;q)constant and vary kin Fig. 4 to demonstrate\nthat time-multiplexing helps when values of pandqare small.\nWe observe that for a given (p;q)pair, the rate increases\nwithkuntil a certain value of k, which we call k(p;q)for\nthat(p;q)pair, at which point the rate hits 1=k(p;q)GHZ\nstates per time slot. This is the maximum rate allowed for by\nthe underlying network topology for that (p;q)pair with the\n(n;k)-GHZ protocol. This behaviour can be explained using\nthe percolation plots in Fig. 2. If we keep (p;q)constant and\nstart increasing k, the network barely percolates at (p;q)when\nk=k(p;q), i.e., (p;q)falls within the super-critical region for\nthe ﬁrst time when k=k(p;q). Ifkis increased beyond k(p;q),\nthe rate starts decaying as 1=ksince (p;q)remains in the\nsuper-critical region for larger values of kand the number of\nshared GHZ states stays 1.\nIf a(p;q)pair falls in between the critical boundaries for\ntwo consecutive kvaluesk1andk2=k1+1, then the optimal\ntime-multiplexing block length k(p;q)=k2. For example,\n(p;q) = (0:4;0:6)falls between the critical boundaries for\nk= 7 andk= 8 as seen in Fig. 2. This (p;q)pair would\ngive exponentially decaying rate with distance for k= 7 and\ndistance independent rate for k\u00158. The optimal value of\ntime-multiplexing block length therefore, k(0:4;0:6)= 8. Ifk\nis increased above 8, the rate will equal 1=k, but will remain\ndistance-independent.\n:4;0:6)= 8. Ifk\nis increased above 8, the rate will equal 1=k, but will remain\ndistance-independent. The optimum k(p;q)depends on both the\nnetwork topology and the nin the (n;k)-GHZ protocol, the\nlargest permissible fusion-group size.\nFig. 5(a) presents a heat-map of the entanglement rate\noptimized over the choice of k. The blue region with rate\nvery close to 1GHZ state per time slot is the super-critical\nregion fork= 1, the non-time multiplexed protocol. We did\nsimulations only up to k= 8. This is why we observe non-\nzero rate only inside the super-critical region of k= 8, and\nhence the maroon region outside of the k= 8 super-critical\nregion should be ignored. Fig. 5(b) shows the optimal time-\nmultiplexing block length k(p;q)for the entire (p;q)space,\nagain modulo the fact that our simulations stop at k= 8.\nBetween the percolation curves for two consecutive kvalues\nk1andk2=k1+1,k(p;q)=k2, as expected. This plot can beused by the network design engineer as a tool to decide the\noptimal degree of time-multiplexing if pandqare known.\nIn Fig. 6, we plot the entanglement generation rate for\nthree different distances between the communicating parties, to\nshow that the rate does not change with increasing (Manhattan)\ndistance between Alice and Bob, since (p;q) = (0:9;0:9)is\nwithin the super-critical regions of all values of k, the time-\nmultiplexing block lengths, between 1and8that are taken.\nIII. M EMORY DECOHERENCE\nIn Section II, we evaluated the performance of our (n;k)-\nGHZ protocol assuming ideal quantum memories that can hold\nqubits noiselessly for \u001CL+ (k\u00001)\u001Cseconds. Our analysis\nshowed that by increasing the time-multiplexing block length\nk, we can in principle indeﬁnitely expand the super-critical\nregion of percolation ans hence achieve a distance-independent\nrate for arbitrarily low pandq. But increasing krequires\nhigher memory coherence times as said above. In this section,\nwe consider more realistic quantum memories that have ﬁnite\ncoherence times, and assess ho\n section,\nwe consider more realistic quantum memories that have ﬁnite\ncoherence times, and assess how the optimal time-multiplexing\nblock length k(p;q)is not only a function of pandq, but\nalso a function of the mean coherence time of a memory, i.e.,\nhow long a memory can (on an average) hold on to a qubit\nnoiselessly.\nA. The memory decoherence model\nWe assume a step-function heralded decoherence model\nwherein each qubit is held perfectly in a quantum memory\nfor a (discrete) number of time slots that is an exponentially-\ndistributed random variable with mean \u0016, and after that the\nqubit is measured off in the Pauli-X basis. This model is a\ngood ﬁrst-order approximation of common quantum memory\ntechnologies, such as color centers in diamond and trapped\nions, which exhibit exponentially decaying qubit ﬁdelities with\na measurable time constant [14]. The protocol stays exactly\nas described in Section II-A, wherein each repeater node\nonly employs local link-state knowledge in forming its fusion\ngroups, and performs Xmeasurements on unused qubits\nwithin each ktime slot block. The only difference between\nthe protocol described in Section II-A is that there may be a\nfew additional qubits within each k-time-slot block—the ones\nwhich happen to decohere—on which Pauli-X measurements\nare performed as well. But these decoherence-induced Pauli-\nX measurements are (a) performed before the fusion-groups\nare formed at the end of each ktime-slot block, and (b) a\nrepeater node does nothave information about which qubits\ndecohered at any neighboring node. Giving the repeater node\nthis information would add a latency of \u001CLto the protocol,\nand more qubits could be lost to decoherence while waiting\nfor this information to arrive, hence defeating the purpose of\nbeneﬁting from time multiplexing.\nAnother thing to note is that our mention of ‘qubit’ in the\npaper should be interpreted as being logical (error-corrected)\nqubits, and not physical qubits. This is because loss on a\nlogical qubit can \nical (error-corrected)\nqubits, and not physical qubits. This is because loss on a\nlogical qubit can be heralded with the error-detection property\nof a quantum code. This is an important assumption in(a)\n (b)\n(c)\n (d)\nFig. 3. Effect of time-multiplexing on entanglement generation rate (in units of shared GHZ states between Alice and Bob per time slot). (a) Rate vs. pfor\n(3;k)-GHZ protocol, (b) Rate vs. qfor(3;k)-GHZ protocol, (c) Rate vs. pfor(4;k)-GHZ protocol, (b) Rate vs. qfor(4;k)-GHZ protocol. For each of\nthe four plots, we have chosen the cases of k= 2 andk= 8. Solid lines correspond to k= 2 and dashed lines are for k= 8. The rate always saturates\nto1=kGHZ states per time slot. This is because, if the percolation condition is met (i.e., in the super-critical regime), there exists with high probability a\nunique single giant-connected (spanning) component, which translates to Alice and Bob sharing one entangled GHZ state among qubits held in their memory\nregisters.\nthe Pauli-X measurement based model of lost qubits in the\npreceding paragraph. Unheralded qubit loss would end up\ndestroying the entanglement in the entire network. Our qubits\ncould be encoded in loss-resistant error correcting codes such\nas a tree code [15] or a crazy graph code, which can correct\nfor unheralded photon loss as well as heralded qubit loss [16],\n[17]. With an appropriately-high coding overhead (ratio of\nlogical to physical qubits in the code), and fault-tolerant n-\nGHZ projective measurements, it will be possible to keep the\nentanglement intact in the network shared by Alice and Bob,\ndespite unheralded losses. A detailed analysis of the optimal\ncodes and the associated coding overhead that would achieve\nsuch performance for speciﬁc memory decoherence models\nand gate error models, remains an open research problem.B. Results\nIn Fig. 7, we keep \u0016, the mean decoherence time of each\nqubit constant and vary the time-multiplexing block length kto\nplot the envelope of site-bond critical boundar\ntant and vary the time-multiplexing block length kto\nplot the envelope of site-bond critical boundaries (solid black\nand dashed red lines) for our (n;k)-GHZ protocol, assuming\nmemory decoherence as described above. Note that, \u0016=2is\nthe average time length for which a link survives after being\ncreated. We observe that decreasing \u0016shrinks the envelope\nimplying the network needs to have high pandqto achieve\ndistance independent rate if memory coherence time is small.\nIfkis increased for a ﬁxed \u0016, the super-critical region expands\nuntilkreaches a threshold k\u0003(\u0016) =\u0016=2. Whenk \u003E\u0016= 2, on\nan average, only the links created in the previous \u0016=2time-\nsteps survive the memory decoherence. If a qubit of a link is\nlost at a repeater, since this information is heralded and known\nto the repeater, it uses it in forming its fusion groups. But thisFig. 4. Rate as a function of time multiplexing block-length kfor different\n(p;q)values. The rate increases with increasing kuntil a threshold k(p;q)\nbeyond which the percolation condition is met, and the rate becomes 1=k,\nand distance independent.\ninformation does not get communicated to the neighboring\nnodes. The neighboring node that holds the other qubit of\nthe link whose one qubit is lost, it may unwittingly include\nthat surviving qubit in one of its fusion groups, assuming\nthe corresponding link is alive. This fusion thus does not\ncontribute to expanding the reach of entanglement in the\ndirection of the lost qubit. Hence, the remaining fusions in\nthe network need to succeed with a higher probability ( q)\ncompared to when k=\u0016=2to get at least one GHZ state\nshared between the consumers, shrinking the super-critical\nregion.\nWe plot rate versus \u0016for three ﬁxed p;q andk= 5\nin Fig 8a. The (p;q) = (0:4;0:6)pair falls out of the\nsuper-critical regions of all \u0016values when k= 5, giving\nexponentially decaying rate. When (p;q) = (1;1), the network\nalways percolates. As a result, the rate is always 1=k= 0:2\nGHZ states per time slot. For (p;q) = (0:9\nways percolates. As a result, the rate is always 1=k= 0:2\nGHZ states per time slot. For (p;q) = (0:9;0:65), the rate\nmonotonically increases with \u0016, and after\u0016= 10 , the increase\nin rate shows diminishing returns. This (p;q)pair is just\noutside or on the boundaries of the site-bond curves when\n\u0016 \u003C10. It just enters the super-critical region when \u0016= 10 ,\nand stays inside, making the rate 1=k= 0:2GHZ states per\ntime slot for \u0016\u003E10.\nFig 8b shows rate as a function of time-multiplexing block\nlengthkfor a ﬁxed \u0016= 10 . If(p;q)is very deep into\nthe super-critical region for all values of k, such as when\n(p;q) = (0:75;1), the rate isn’t affected by memory decoher-\nence and follows the 1=kcurve. If (p;q)is inside the super-\ncritical region of only a few kvalues, the rate increases with k\nuntilkreaches a certain value, what we call k(p;q;\u0016 ). If we keep\nincreasingksuch thatk\u003Ek (p;q;\u0016 ), the rate starts falling, even-\ntually reaching 0. For example, when (p;q) = (0:75;0:65), the\nrate is maximum for k(0:75;0:65;10)= 4.IV. N ETWORK DIVISION\nIn then-GHZ protocol discussed in [9], which is the (n;1)-\nGHZ special-case of the time-multiplexed protocol described\nin Section II-A, the Bell pairs shared between neighboring\nrepeaters are fused using n-fusions at every repeater that is\nnot a consumer. At the end of each time slot, the consumers\nend up with shared GHZ state(s) with some probability. The\nexpected number of these shared GHZ states per time slot is\nthe entanglement rate of the protocol. This protocol translates\nto a site-bond percolation problem on the lattice created after\nperforming fusions such that the site and bond occupation\nprobabilities of the percolation problem are the fusion and link\nsuccess probabilities, i.e., qandprespectively. The number of\ndisjoint components in the lattice that contain both consumers\nafter performing the fusion gives the number of GHZ states\nshared between the consumers. In the supercritical regime of\na most standard percolation problems, such\nred between the consumers. In the supercritical regime of\na most standard percolation problems, such as site, bond, and\nsite-bond percolation, there is with high probability only one\nconnected component whose size is proportional to the number\nof nodes in the network. This unique connected component\nis known as the giant connected component . This feature of\npercolation limits the rate of the protocol to one GHZ state\nper time slot in the super-critical regime. This upper-bound\non the rate is independent of network topology. However, the\nmaximum achievable rate for a given network is given by the\nmin-cut of the network [10]. For example, with p=q= 1,\nthe square grid network should be able to achieve a rate of 4\nGHZ states per slot. However, a randomized protocol as ours\nin this paper, would only achieve a rate of one GHZ state\nper slot, even for p=q= 1. In this section, we show how\nspatial-division multiplexing can help go beyond 1GHZ state\nper slot, even without time multiplexing (i.e., for k= 1), for\nnon-trivial values of pandq.\nA. The network-division protocol\nThe rate of the n-GHZ protocol of [9] can be increased in\nthe large (p;q)region by enforcing more than one disjoint\ncomponents to be created between Alice and Bob. In this\nsection, we describe one possible method to achieve that. We\ndivide the square-grid network into four regions as shown\nin Fig. 9. This method can also be seen as spatial-division\nmultiplexing. We deﬁne region I (shown in green) such that\nit is a square region and Alice and Bob are located at its\ndiagonally opposite corners. Region II (shown in red) is\ncomposed of three copies of region I. Region III is identical to\nregion II in shape but on the opposite side of region I. The rest\nof the network (the white space in Fig. 9) constitutes region IV .\nThe quantum repeaters on the boundaries of the four regions\nare not allowed to fuse links from different regions. This is\nequivalent to splitting every repeater on the region boundaries\ninto two i\nifferent regions. This is\nequivalent to splitting every repeater on the region boundaries\ninto two internal repeaters that act independent of one another,\nforming fusion groups within their own respective regions.\nFor the square grid, each of these two internal repeaters can\nperform only a 2-fusion, i.e., a BSM. This rule effectively\ndisconnects one region from its neighboring regions and each\nregion yields up to one shared entangled states. If a (p;q)value(a)\n (b)\nFig. 5.

Entanglement rate is plotted as a function of the time-multiplexing\nblock length kfor(p;q) = (0:9;0:9), plotted for three different distance\nbetween the communicating parties Alice and Bob.

The\noriginaln-GHZ protocol of [9] is performed inside each\nregion separately. If (p;q)is inside the super-critical region of\nregion I of the protocol, i.e., the underlying lattice percolates\nfrom Alice to Bob, we can say that in region II, the lattice\npercolates from Alice to repeater C, then from C to D, and\nfrom D back to Bob. We can similarly divide the white region\nin smaller regions of the dimensions of region I and ensure\npercolation between Alice and Bob. We can conjecture that this\nconstruction can be extended to arbitrary loc\nion between Alice and Bob. We can conjecture that this\nconstruction can be extended to arbitrary locations of A and B.\nFig. 7. Site-bond percolation envelopes shown as black solid and red dashed\nlines when the quantum memories have ﬁnite coherence time, distributed\nexponentially with mean \u0016= 10 and\u0016= 12 , respectively. Increasing\nmemory coherence time improves the super-critical region, as expected. The\nsite-bond percolation curves for different values of kwhen\u0016= 10 are shown\nas grey lines. The super-critical region expands with increasing ktillk=\u0016=2\nand starts shrinking if kis increased further.\nNote that, as Alice and Bob both can have at most one link per\nregion each, the entangled state created in each region can only\nbe a two-qubit state or a Bell state. This restriction in effect\nshrinks the percolation boundaries for each region (compared\nto that of the overall network), but for a high-enough (p;q)\nopens up the possibility of multiple percolating regions and\nhence a rate that is higher than 1GHZ state per slot.\nThis network division rule can be easily generalized to any\nregular network topology such that every region of the network\nhas exactly one link each from Alice and Bob. The maximum\nrate achieved for this rule is equal to the node degree of the\nnetwork topology, which is also equal to the min-cut of the(a)\n (b)\nFig. 8.

If an n-GHZ protocol is performed on a regular\nnetwork topology with node degree dsuch thatn \u003C d , we\nwould modify the fusion rule such that the neighbors of the\nconsumers always use the links shared with the consumers, if\nsuccessful, for fusion. If the neighbors do not end up using the\nlinks with the consumers, the entanglement rate immediate\n. If the neighbors do not end up using the\nlinks with the consumers, the entanglement rate immediately\ndrops to zero in that region. In case of random graphs such\nas the conﬁguration graph, although it is always possible to\ndivide the network into different regions, the construction of\nthese regions is not obvious. Even for the square-grid lattice,\nit is very likely that our region subdivisions are not optimal.\nMoreover, the optimal division of the network into regions\nmay be a function of pandq, and will also depend upon\nk, when we employ this space-division strategy to the time-\nmultiplexed (n;k)-GHZ protocol. In recent work, Manna and\nZiff analyzed a new percolation problem [18], wherein m\npoints separated by a distance proportional to the lattice size\nLsimultaneously connect together, or a single point at the\ncenter of a lattice connects to the boundary through adjacent\nconnected points of a single cluster. We believe that a variant\nof such a percolation problem can help us study the percolation\nproblem induced by our space-division-multiplexed protocol\nwithin each disconnected region.\nB. Simulation results of entanglement rates\nIn Fig. 10(a), we plot the entanglement rate as a function\nofpfor ﬁxedqvalues, and in Fig. 10(b), we plot the\nentanglement rate as a function of qfor ﬁxedpvalues. We\nobserve that the network division protocol achieves the rate\nof4GHZ states per slot at p=q= 1, the maximum rate\nachievable in a square grid network. The rate plots show\na percolation transition, but of a different critical exponent\ncompared to the percolation seen earlier for the (n;k)-GHZ\nprotocol. Each region has its own critical boundary in the (p;q)\nspace, which we have not evaluated. The total rate is sum of\nFig. 9.

When the rate is above 2, e.g., for\n(p;q) = (0:85;9), it implies that at least two regions are in\ntheir respective super-critical regions.\nFurthermore, we observe that for (p;q)values just inside\nthe super-critical region, the rate attained by dividing the\nnetwork is lower than the undivided network. Hence, for\nlow(p;q)values, spatial division multiplexing is not always\nadvisable. This is because that (p;q)which was inside the\nsuper-critical region of the undivided network may fall out\nof the super-critical regions of allthe four regions. On the(a)\n (b)\nFig. 10.

Alice and Bob are located at a Manhattan distance of 25 in the same row, sufﬁciently inside the network\nto ensure that region IV can be divided into squares of region I. For some values of (p;q)the undivided network achieves better rate than the divided network.\nother hand, if (p;q)is very high, spatial division multiplexing\ncan afford far superior rates than the n-GHZ protocol. Note\nthat time-multiplexed n-GHZ protocol can be run in each\nregion to improve the super-critical site-bond region further.\nThe exploration of this is being left for future work.\nV. C ONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\nIt was recently shown that by allowing quantum\nswitches —generalization of a quantum repeater that perform\ndynamically-switchable quantum measurements—in a quan-\ntum network to perform multi-qubit joint projective measure-\nments in the GHZ basis, the quantum network can achieve\ndistance-independent entanglement rate that can vastly\nhe GHZ basis, the quantum network can achieve\ndistance-independent entanglement rate that can vastly surpass\nthe exponentially decaying rate in a certain region of link\nsuccess probability pand fusion success probability q, called\nthesuper-critical region of a new mixed-percolation prob-\nlem [9]. This parameter region is determined by the percolation\ntheory. In this paper, we showed that this super-critical region\ncan be expanded by increasing the effective (p;q)by use\nof time multiplexing [4]. As a result, the time-multiplexed\nprotocol attains distance-independent entanglement rate for\nvalues of (p;q)for which the network would have experienced\nexponentially decaying rate if not for the utilization of time\nmultiplexing. We deﬁne an (n;k)-GHZ protocol, wherein a\nswitch can perform a fusion measurement on up to nlocally-\nheld qubits, and it chooses which groups of qubits to fuse after\nevery subsequent block of ktime slots. For a given network\ntopology, every (p;q)pair has an optimal value of time\nmultiplexing block length k(p;q)associated with it. Increasing\nthe time-multiplexing block length kbeyond that only hurts\nthe rate, as it starts decaying as 1=kGHZ states per slot. If the\n(p;q)parameters are known, we have designed a method to\ncalculate the degree of time-multiplexing that should be used\nin the network to attain the maximum possible rate for our\n(n;k)-GHZ protocol.The rate achieved by our (n;k)-GHZ based time-\nmultiplexing protocol could be improved further by restricting\nthe repeaters to mix-and-match links generated in speciﬁc\ngroups of time-steps. For example, if k= 8, then the repeaters\ncould fuse links created in the ﬁrst four time slots with each\nother and those created in time slots 5-8 with one another.\nThis protocol would achieve the rate that is twice that of the\n(n;4)-GHZ protocol rate. But it also comes with a trade off:\nif(p;q)is outside the super-critical region for k= 4, dividing\nthe links into two groups may not be the best idea. Ideally,\none\n-critical region for k= 4, dividing\nthe links into two groups may not be the best idea. Ideally,\none could do an integer partitioning of ksuch that there are\nnkpartitions and if the network percolates at (p;q)for the\nsmallest partition, the rate achieved by the partitioned protocol\nisnktimes the (n;k)-GHZ protocol.\nWhile time-multiplexing helps to improve the rate in low\nthe(p;q)regime, it doesn’t help much when (p;q)is high.\nWe observed that, for the n-GHZ protocol, i.e., the k= 1\nspecial case of our (n;k)-GHZ protocol, space-division mul-\ntiplexing, i.e., restricting the ﬂow of entanglement to certain\nsub-regions of the network, boosts the rate for when there is\ntoo much connectivity in the network caused due to high (p;q)\nvalues. It results in multiple independent entangled states to be\ncreated between Alice and Bob. We show that by strategically\ndividing the network into disconnected regions, it is possible to\nachieve the entanglement capacity (the min-cut rate) [10]—the\nmaximum achievable capacity of the network assuming ideal\nrepeaters—at p=q= 1. We believe that the min-cut rate of\n4GHZ states per slot for the square grid may be achievable\nfor(p;q)strictly less than (1;1)with the use of optimal time\nand spatial multiplexing. This will have to involve the study\nof percolation properties of the network sub-regions, which\ncould potentially beneﬁt from some recent work in percolation\ntheory [18]. We leave the exploration of this to future work.\nFinally, we break the assumption of having ideal quan-\ntum memories with inﬁnite coherence time and use realisticquantum memories whose coherence times are exponentially\ndistributed random variables with mean \u0016. The super-critical\nregion expands with increasing kuntil it reaches the average\nlink survival time, \u0016=2. The region shrinks when k \u003E \u0016= 2\nas the network requires the fusions to succeed with a higher\nprobability to produce end-to-end shared entangled states. We\nﬁnd that if the network is deep into the super-critical \nduce end-to-end shared entangled states. We\nﬁnd that if the network is deep into the super-critical region of\npercolation for a given k, i.e., inside all the percolation curves\nfor different time-multiplexing block lengths and a ﬁxed \u0016\nmemory, decoherence doesn’t hurt the rate. The rate decays\nas1=k, similar to the case when ideal memories are used.\nHowever, for other (p;q)values, there is an optimal time-\nmultiplexing block length ( k(p;q;\u0016 )), which is a function of\n\u0016;n and the network topology that achieves the maximum\nrate. The rate starts decaying if kis increased beyond k(p;q;\u0016 ).\nAlthough our memory decoherence model is an improve-\nment over using ideal memories, it is still a very simpli-\nﬁed model. A better decoherence model would include links\nestablished with sub-unity ﬁdelity at the outset, and realis-\ntic continuous-time noise mechanisms such as depolarization\nnoise acting on each qubit while it is held in a quantum\nmemory. Multi-path entanglement routing using BSMs on\nlinks with sub-unity ﬁdelity was recently studied in [7] by\noptimizing the scheduling of BSMs and Bell state puriﬁcation\nin the network. Studying the performance of the (n;k)-GHZ\nprotocol under this decoherence model would require schedul-\ning GHZ-state puriﬁcations and n-fusions in the network.\nRefs. [19], [20] study GHZ puriﬁcation circuits, but they\nrequire quantum states of the same sizes to undergo puriﬁ-\ncation. It may not always be possible to get two or more GHZ\nstates of the same size shared between two repeaters. Hence,\none needs to design GHZ puriﬁcation circuits that can work\nwith GHZ states of different sizes. One can go a step further\nand include gate imperfections, i.e., noisy gates to perform\nthe GHZ entanglement using local operations and classical\ncommunications (LOCC), in the analysis and performance\nevaluation of entanglement distribution in a quantum network.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors thank Gayane Vardoyan for insightful discus-\nsions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.

Effectively determining\nwhich requests are served by a given QS is fundamental to\nfoster developments in practical QCN applications, like quantum\ndata centers. However, the state-of-the-art on QS operation has\noverlooked this association problem, and it mainly focused on\nQCNs with a single QS. In this paper, the request-QS association\nproblem in QCNs is formulated as a matching game that\ncaptures the limited QCN resources, heterogeneous application-\nspeciﬁc ﬁdelity requirements, and scheduling of the different\nQS operations. To solve this game, a swap-stable request-QS\nassociation (RQSA) algorithm is proposed while considering\npartial QCN information availability. Extensive simulations are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RQSA\nalgorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed RQSA\nalgorithm achieves a near-optimal (within 5%) performance in\nterms of the percentage of served requests and overall achieved\nﬁdelity, while outperforming benchmark greedy solutions by over\n13% . Moreover, the proposed RQSA algorithm is shown to be\nscalable and maintain its near-optimal performance even when\nt\nroposed RQSA algorithm is shown to be\nscalable and maintain its near-optimal performance even when\nthe size of the QCN increases.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum communication networks (QCNs) are seen as\na pillar of future communication technologies due to their\nadvantages in terms of security, sensing capabilities, and\ncomputational powers. QCNs rely on the creation and distri-\nbution of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs of entangled\nquantum states between distant QCN nodes [1]. Each EPR pair\nconsists of two inherently-correlated photons, each of which\nis transferred to a QCN node to establish an end-to-end (e2e)\nentangled connection. However, the fragile nature of entangled\nphotons results in exponential losses that increase with the\ntravelled distance over quantum channels, e.g., optical ﬁber.\nAs such, intermediate quantum repeater nodes are needed to\nsplit long distances into shorter segments by performing en-\ntanglement swapping on entangled photons to connect distant\nQCN nodes [2]. When such repeaters share multiple EPR pairs\nwith several QCN nodes to create e2e connections, they are\ncalled quantum switches (QSs) .\nIn practice, a QS has a limited-capacity quantum memory\nfor photon storage. A heralding station is responsible for\ngenerating EPR pairs and distributing each pair between the\nQS and other QCN nodes to create link-level connections(LLCs). The ﬁdelity , or quality, of an LLC can be enhanced\nby performing entanglement distillation before swapping two\nLLCs to establish an e2e connection [3]. Practical applications,\nlike quantum data centers and quantum cloud networks, en-\ncompass QCN setups with multiple QSs connecting several\nend-node quantum devices. The design of such multiple-\nQS QCNs requires overcoming many challenges such as\nthe limited storage capacity of QSs, imperfections associated\nwith EPR generation and transmission, the need to schedule\nthe different QS operations (i.e., entanglement swapping and\ndistillation), and the presence of heterogeneous\nrent QS operations (i.e., entanglement swapping and\ndistillation), and the presence of heterogeneous application-\nspeciﬁc minimum ﬁdelity requirements.\nMultiple prior works [4]–[10] attempted to address some of\nthe aforementioned challenges, and those works can be divided\ninto three main types. First, some works, like [4], considered\na QS-based multi-hop QCN and performed entanglement pro-\nvisioning and path selection to maximize throughput. Second,\nprior works, such as [5], considered routing EPR pairs over\nseveral QCN paths to create e2e connections. The last type,\nwhich is the most relevant to our work, considered star-shaped\nQCNs, where several nodes are connected to a single QS\nthrough EPR pairs [6]–[10]. For instance, the work in [6] was\nthe ﬁrst to consider aggregate QS capacity and analytically\nanalyze its stability. However, almost-perfect conditions were\nassumed in [6]. Additionally, the work in [7] considered\na QCN with a QS serving requests having minimum ﬁ-\ndelity constraints. However, entanglement distillation was not\nconsidered in [7]. Meanwhile, the work in [8] studied QS\nstability and swap scheduling. However, the authors in [8] did\nnot include entanglement distillation and assumed an inﬁnite\nlifetime of EPR pairs. Moreover, the work in [9] analyzed the\ncapacity regions and stability of a single QS and scheduled\nswapping/distillation operations to satisfy minimum ﬁdelity\nrequirements while considering noisy gates and measurements.\nHowever, [9] considered a homogeneous ﬁdelity for all link-\nlevel EPR pairs. Finally, the authors in [10] proposed a\nmemory allocation policy for a constrained QS operation in a\nstar-shaped QCN. However, the model proposed in [10] did\nnot account for ﬁdelity requirements of both link-level and e2e\nconnections and did not schedule distillation operations.\nFurthermore, these prior works [6]–[10] focused on a single\nQS handling all e2e requests and did not consider multiple QSsarXiv:2305.12682v1  [cs.NI]  22 May 2023Rx end\nno\n all e2e requests and did not consider multiple QSsarXiv:2305.12682v1  [cs.NI]  22 May 2023Rx end\nnodesTx end nodes\nQS 1\nQS 2\nQS Q\nMK\nDistill\nSwap Memory Memory\nRequest-QS \nAssociation\n1\n2\n31\n2\n3EPRFmin\n1,1\nFmin\nFmin\nFmin\nFmin\nFmin\n1,2\nRequestsFmin\n2,2\nFmin\n2,2\n2,M\n2,M\nK,3\nK,2Fig. 1. Studied QCN model for the requests-QSs association problem.\nconnected to several end nodes with heterogeneous resources\nand ﬁdelity constraints. In such a QCN setup (see Fig. 1),\nit is essential to associate each request with the QS that\noptimizes its ﬁdelity. This request-QS association problem ,\nwhich is essential for designing quantum data centers, has been\noverlooked in prior works. Accordingly, there is a need for a\nthorough investigation of the request-QS association problem\nin QCNs with multiple QSs while taking into consideration\nthe scheduling of QS entanglement swapping/distillation op-\nerations, memory limitations, and performance requirements.\nThe main contribution of this work is a novel matching-\nbased framework for optimizing request-QS association in\nQCNs with multiple QSs, possessing heterogeneous resources,\nthat satisfy QCN users’ performance requirements while con-\nsidering practical constraints of QCN elements. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to explore this research\narea, and therefore, we make the following key contributions:\n\u000FWe propose the ﬁrst holistic analysis of the request-\nQS association problem in QCNs under limited resource\nconstraints and heterogeneous ﬁdelity requirements.\n\u000FWe formulate the request-QS association problem as\namatching game [11] where both requests and QSs\nrank each other based on ﬁdelity-maximizing preferences.\nThis novel matching approach enables us to solve the\nconsidered association problem without requiring full\nknowledge of QCN information.\n\u000FWe propose a novel request-QS association (RQSA) al-\ngorithm based on swap-matching [12] to solve the for-\nmulated matching game while guaranteeing convergence\nunder partial Q\nmatching [12] to solve the for-\nmulated matching game while guaranteeing convergence\nunder partial QCN information availability.\n\u000FSimulation results show that our RQSA algorithm is\nscalable and achieves a near-optimal performance within\n5%of the optimal solution in terms of served requests\nand overall served e2e ﬁdelity.\nII. S YSTEM MODEL\nConsider a QCN composed of a set QofQQSs connected\nto a set of end nodes through link-level EPR pairs. The end\nnodes are split into transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) nodes,\nwhere requests for e2e connections are sent from Tx nodes to\nthe QSs (see Fig. 1). Moreover, Kdenotes the set of KTx\nnodes, andMthe set ofMRx nodes.The operation of the QCN occurs in a time-slotted manner.\nPrior to each time slot, heralding stations installed between\nQSs and end nodes attempt to create nlink-level EPR pairs\nto connect every QS q2 Q to every Tx (and Rx) node,\nk2 K (andm2 M ), respectively, with a probability of\nsuccesspk;q(andpq;m) for each pair that depends on the\ncorresponding link length. Accordingly, the link-level EPR\ngeneration process between a QS and a Tx (or Rx) node\nfollows a binomial distribution with parameters nandpk;q\n(orpq;m) [9]. Thus, each QS is connected to all Tx nodes\nthroughNTx\nk;qsuccessfully-generated link-level EPR pairs each\nhaving a ﬁdelity ofFTx\nk;q. Similarly, every QS is linked to each\nRx node through NRx\nq;msuccessfully-generated link-level EPR\npairs each of ﬁdelity FRx\nq;m. The EPR pairs are then stored in\nquantum memories at both the QSs and end nodes. Those pairs\nare assumed to remain coherent and maintain their ﬁdelities\nfor one time slot, before being discarded.\nAt the beginning of each time slot, Tx nodes submit a set\nRofRrequests to the QSs. Each request is represented as a\ntuple,ri;j\nl= (i;j;Fmin\ni;j), wherel2f1;2;:::;Rg,i2K, and\nj2M . Here,rk;m\nlrepresents a request by Tx node k2K to\nestablish a single e2e EPR pair with Rx node m2M with a\nminimum ﬁdelity of Fmin\nk;m. In addition, each submitted request\nmu\nEPR pair with Rx node m2M with a\nminimum ﬁdelity of Fmin\nk;m. In addition, each submitted request\nmust be served, if feasible, during its submission time slot, or\nbe discarded. We assume that, during each time slot, every Tx\nnode may submit multiple repeated requests that are identical\nand have exactly the same required minimum ﬁdelity, since\nthey intend to serve the same application.\nIn our model, we consider that only partial QCN infor-\nmation is available to the Tx nodes when submitting their\nrequests. In particular, each Tx node has access to only the\ninformation related to its link-level EPR pairs with every QS.\nMoreover, the QSs publicly announce information about their\nlink-level EPR pairs with every Rx node to the Tx nodes.\nEach QSq2Q can perform two distinct quantum oper-\nations: 1) entanglement swapping , to connect a Tx node to\nan Rx node, and 2) entanglement distillation to enhance the\nﬁdelity of link-level EPR pairs. Every link-level EPR pair is\nrepresented by a Werner state \u001A=Wj 00ih 00j+1\u0000W\n4\u0005;\nwhereWis the Werner parameter that directly affects the\nﬁdelity of those pairs, which is given as: F=3W+1\n4[13].\nWhen a QS q2Q swaps two link-level EPR pairs, one\nwith Tx node k2K having ﬁdelity FTx\nk;q, and the other with\nRx nodem2M having ﬁdelity FRx\nq;m, the resulting e2e EPR\npair has a ﬁdelity given by [2]:\nS(FTx\nk;q;FRx\nq;m) =1\n4+3\n4\u00124FTx\nk;q\u00001\n3\u0013\u00124FRx\nq;m\u00001\n3\u0013\n: (1)\nWe adopt the Oxford entanglement distillation protocol [3]\nfor performing entanglement distillation of two link-level EPR\npairs. According to this protocol, two identical EPR pairs with\ninitial ﬁdelity Finitial can be distilled into one EPR pair having\na higher ﬁdelity given by [3]:\nD(Finitial ) =(Finitial )2+ (1\u0000Finitial\n3)2\n(Finitial )2+ 2Finitial (1\u0000Finitial\n3) + 5(1\u0000Finitial\n3)2:(2)\nTo simplify the analysis, a QS is assumed to performat most one distillation operation for each link-level EPR\npair. Also, if performed, distillation is considered to always\nprecede entanglement swapping [9]. A\n\npair. Also, if performed, distillation is considered to always\nprecede entanglement swapping [9]. Accordingly, there are\nfour possible actions regarding the scheduling of the en-\ntanglement swapping/distillation operations to handle each\nsubmitted request that every QS can take.1The action choice\ndirectly affects the ﬁdelities of the resulting e2e EPR pairs\nand the number of available link-level EPR pairs in quantum\nmemories. Here, we introduce \u000BTx\njand\u000BRx\njto denote the\nnumber of utilized link-level EPR pairs from both Tx and Rx\nnodes’ memories, respectively, as a result of each possible QS\nactionj2f1;2;3;4g. The four considered actions and their\ncorresponding impacts are:\n1) Direct entanglement swapping: Swap one link-level\nEPR pair connected to Tx node k2K with one link-level EPR\npair connected to Rx node m2M . When QSq2Q performs\nthis action to serve request rk;m\nl, the ﬁdelity of the resulting\ne2e EPR pair will be Fe2e\nq;k;m; 1=S(FTx\nk;q;FRx\nq;m). Consequently,\nthe number of link-level EPR pairs between QS q2Q and\nTx nodek2K and Rx node m2M , i.e.,NTx\nk;qandNRx\nq;m,\nrespectively, are both reduced by 1. The number of utilized\nlink-level EPR pairs associated with the direct entanglement\nswapping action are given by \u000BTx\n1=\u000BRx\n1= 1.\n2) Tx distillation, then entanglement swapping: Distill two\nlink-level EPR pairs connected to the Tx node k2K, then\nswap the distilled pair with an EPR pair connected to the Rx\nnodem2M . When QS q2Q performs this action to serve\na requestrk;m\nl, the ﬁdelity of the resulting e2e EPR pair is\nFe2e\nq;k;m; 2=S(D(FTx\nk;q);FRx\nq;m). Consequently, the number of\nlink-level EPR pairs between QS q2Q and Tx node k2K\nis reduced by 2, while the number of link-level EPR pairs\nbetween QS q2 Q and Rx node m2 M is reduced by\n1, as the entanglement distillation utilizes two link-level EPR\npairs. The number of utilized link-level EPR pairs associated\nwith the Tx distillation, then entanglement swapping action\nare\u000BTx\n2= 2, and\u000BRx\n2= 1.\n3) Rx distillation, \nhe Tx distillation, then entanglement swapping action\nare\u000BTx\n2= 2, and\u000BRx\n2= 1.\n3) Rx distillation, then entanglement swapping: Distill two\nlink-level EPR pairs connected to Rx node m2 M , then\nswap the distilled pair with an EPR pair connected to Tx\nnodek2K. When QS q2Q performs this action to serve\nrequestrk;m\nl, the ﬁdelity of the resulting e2e EPR pair is\nFe2e\nq;k;m; 3=S(FTx\nk;q;D(FRx\nq;m)). Consequently, the number of\nlink-level EPR pairs between QS qand Tx node kis reduced\nby 1, while the number of link-level EPR pairs between QS\nq2Q and Rx node mis reduced by 2. The number of utilized\nlink-level EPR pairs associated with the Rx distillation, then\nentanglement swapping action are\u000BTx\n3= 1, and\u000BRx\n3= 2.\n4) Tx & Rx distillation, then entanglement swapping:\nDistill two link-level EPR pairs connected to Tx node k2K,\nand simultaneously distill two EPR pairs connected to Rx node\nm2M , then swap the two distilled pairs. When QS q2Q\nperforms this action to serve request rk;m\nl, the ﬁdelity of the\n1A higher number of possible actions can be easily integrated into our\nmodel by allowing QSs to perform more distillation operations. Also, due to\nspace constraints, we have omitted the terms corresponding to measurement\nerrors and gate noise from the given swapping and distillation ﬁdelity\nexpressions, which also can be easily integrated into our model.resulting e2e EPR pair is Fe2e\nq;k;m; 4=S(D(FTx\nk;q);D(FRx\nq;m)).\nConsequently, the number of link-level EPR pairs between QS\nqand Tx node kand Rx node mare both reduced by 2. The\nnumbers of utilized link-level EPR pairs associated with the\nTx & Rx distillation, then entanglement swapping action are\n\u000BTx\n4=\u000BRx\n4= 2.\nTo simplify notation, we introduce the vectors \u000BTx=\n[1;2;1;2]Tand\u000BRx= [1;1;2;2]Tofutilized link-level EPR\npairs that result from the four possible QS actions. Next, we\nformulate the request-QS association problem and propose a\nmatching game formulation [14].\nIII. R EQUEST -QS A SSOCIATION AS A MATCHING GAME\nA. Reques\nropose a\nmatching game formulation [14].\nIII. R EQUEST -QS A SSOCIATION AS A MATCHING GAME\nA. Request-QS Association Problem\nIn the request-QS association problem, a submitted request\nrk;m\nl2R must be associated, if feasible, with at most one\nQSq2Q , or be discarded. This QS performs one of the\nfour aforementioned actions to serve the request during a time\nslot. We deﬁne matching\u0011as an association between QSs and\nrequests. The association between a submitted request rk;m\nl\nand a QSqis denoted as (rk;m\nl;q)2\u0011. Each QS q2Q\ncan serve multiple requests. We deﬁne R\u0011\nq\u0012R as the set\nof requests associated with QS qin matching \u0011. As multiple\nrequests are associated with each QS, we have a many-to-one\nmatching problem.\nEach submitted request must be served with the highest\nﬁdelity possible. Therefore, we deﬁne the utility of a submitted\nrequestrk;m\nl2R when associated with QS q2Q as the\nﬁdelity of its generated e2e EPR pair:\nUl(q) =Fe2e\nq;k;m; 1=S(FTx\nk;q;FRx\nq;m); (3)\nwherek2 K andm2 M are the corresponding Tx/Rx\nnodes, respectively, in rk;m\nl= (k;m;Fmin\nk;m). (3) considers\nthe worst case for QS q, which corresponds to taking the\ndirect entanglement swap action without any distillation, since\nthat action yields the lowest ﬁdelity of the resulting e2e EPR\npair. This worst-case assumption stems from the fact that the\nrequest (i.e., the end node) does not know which action will\nbe taken by its prospective QS q.\nSimilarly, each QS aims to serve each request with the\nhighest ﬁdelity possible. In matching \u0011, for each individual\nrequestrk;m\nl2R served by QS q2Q , the respective QS\nutility for that request is the resulting e2e EPR pair’s ﬁdelity:\n~Uq(rk;m\nl) =(\nFe2e\nq;k;m;jq;k;m (\u0011);ifFe2e\nq;k;m;jq;k;m (\u0011)\u0015Fmin\nk;m\n\u00001; else:(4)\nIn (4),jq;k;m(\u0011)captures the fact that the ﬁdelity of the\nresulting e2e EPR pair depends on the action taken by the\nQS. For instance, jq;k;m(\u0011)2f1;2;3;4grepresents the action\ntaken by the QS to serve request rk;m\nlbased on matching \u0011.\nThe second case in the \nsents the action\ntaken by the QS to serve request rk;m\nlbased on matching \u0011.\nThe second case in the above expression corresponds to the\nsituation when the QS cannot serve the request because it\ncannot provide the request’s minimum ﬁdelity requirement.\nEach QSq2Q must decide on the actions that maximize\nthe ﬁdelity for its associated requests, i.e., maximize (4) for\neach request. After the optimal actions are identiﬁed, theoverall utility of QS q2Q for its associated set of requests\nR\u0011\nqin matching \u0011is the sum of the individual request utilities:\nUq(R\u0011\nq) =X\nrk;m\nl2R\u0011\nq~Uq(rk;m\nl); (5)\nwhich captures the fact that the goal of each QS q2Q is\nto maximize the overall delivered e2e ﬁdelities for the set of\nassociated requests R\u0011\nq.\nThe process of selecting the actions to serve the associ-\nated requests inR\u0011\nqby QSq2 Q can be formulated as\nan optimization problem. To do so, we deﬁne Aqas the\nactions matrix for QS q, which includes all possible actions\nfor all its associated requests rk;m\nl2 R\u0011\nq. In particular,\nAq= [a1;a2;a3;a4], where each vector ajis of dimension\f\fR\u0011\nq\f\f\u00021, and each entry al;jofaj, givenl2f1;2;:::;\f\fR\u0011\nq\f\fg\nandj2f1;2;3;4g, corresponds to a request rk;m\nl2R\u0011\nq. Each\nelemental;jis binary, where it takes a value of one when\nactionjis performed to serve request rk;m\nl. The dimension of\nAqis\f\fR\u0011\nq\f\f\u00024. Accordingly, the action-selection optimization\nproblem for QS q2Q is:\nP1 : max\nAqX\nrk;m\nl2R\u0011\nqUq(rk;m\nl) (6a)\ns:t:X\ni:ri=rk;m\ni;8m2MqAq\u0001\u000BTx\u0014NTx\nk;q;8k2Kq;(6b)\nX\ni:ri=rk;m\ni;8k2KqAq\u0001\u000BRx\u0014NRx\nq;m;8m2Mq;(6c)\nwhere the objective function corresponds to the overall utility\nachieved by QS q2Q from all its associated requests R\u0011\nq.\nConstraint (6b) ensures that the number of used link-level EPR\npairs between the QS and Tx node k2Kqdoes not exceed\nthe number of available link-level EPR pairs between them,\nNTx\nk;q,8k;q2Kq;Q. Similarly, constraint (6c) ensures that the\nnumber of consumed link-level EPR pairs between the the QS\nand Rx node m2Mqdoes not exceed the number of\ner of consumed link-level EPR pairs between the the QS\nand Rx node m2Mqdoes not exceed the number of available\nlink-level EPR pairs between them, NRx\nq;m,8q;m2Q;Mq.\nSolving the request-QS association problem is challenging,\nbecause it must factor in the limited number of available\nlink-level EPR pairs of the Tx and Rx nodes and the QSs.\nAlso, each QS must schedule its actions such that the max-\nimum number of submitted requests in the QCN is served\nduring each time step. Solving the request-QS association\nproblem using classical optimization techniques is impractical\nbecause the number of possible combinations of associated\nrequests per QS is 2R, i.e., the complexity grows exponentially\nwithR. Accordingly, we propose a computationally efﬁcient,\ndecentralized approach that accounts for the partial QCN\ninformation availability.\nB. Matching Game Formulation\nMatching theory [14] is a powerful tool that has been\nadopted to solve several complex communication network\nproblems [15]. Here, we leverage matching theory to formulate\nthe request-QS association problem as a matching game so\nas to overcome its exponentially growing complexity. Notethat our formulation differs from prior works on matching\ngames for classical wireless systems [16] in the fact that\nwe have to consider quantum-speciﬁc constraints regarding\nthe ﬁdelity of EPR pairs, limited quantum memory, and\nheterogeneous minimum ﬁdelity requirements. Formally, the\nproposed matching game is deﬁned as follows.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Matching game) .A matching game is deﬁned\nby two sets of matching parties ( R;Q) and two preference re-\nlations\u001FReq\nr,\u001FQS\nqallowing each submitted request rk;m\nl2R\nto rank the QSs and each QS q2Q to rank sets of associated\nrequests.\nFor any request rk;m\nl, apreference relation \u001FReq\nris deﬁned\nover the set of QSs Qsuch that, for any two QSs, q;q02Q,\nwe have:\nq\u001FReq\nrq0,Ul(q)\u003EUl(q0); (7)\nwhich means that request rk;m\nlprefers QS q2Q over QS\nq02 Q whenever the utility (3) associated with q2 Q is\nhigher\nt request rk;m\nlprefers QS q2Q over QS\nq02 Q whenever the utility (3) associated with q2 Q is\nhigher than the utility associated with q0.\nSimilar to the case of requests, for any QS q2 Q , we\ndeﬁne a preference relation \u001FQS\nqover the set of associated\nrequestsR\u0011\nq. For any two matchings \u0011;\u00110, the QS ranks the\ncorresponding sets of associated requests R\u0011\nqin matching \u0011\nandR\u00110\nqin matching \u00110as follows:\nR\u0011\nq\u001FQS\nqR\u00110\nq,Uq(R\u0011\nq)\u003EUq(R\u00110\nq); (8)\nwhich means that the QS q2 Q prefers the setR\u0011\nqof\nassociated requests in matching \u0011over the setR\u00110\nqin matching\n\u00110whenever the overall utility (5) associated with R\u0011\nqis higher\nthan the overall utility associated with R\u00110\nq.\nC. Proposed Solution and Algorithm\nIn this section we propose an algorithm to ﬁnd a stable\nmatching\u0011. Classical deﬁnitions of stability [11], [14] in\nmatching games, which rely on preferences of individual\nmatching parties, cannot be applied to our proposed match-\ning formulation. This is because the preference relations (8)\nrequire QSs to rank sets of associated requests instead of\nindividual requests. To overcome this challenge, we adopt\nthe deﬁnition of swap stability [12], which means that no\nsubmitted request or QS can increase its utility by swapping\nits current matching partner.2The foundation for the analysis\nof swap stability is a swap matching , which simply results\nfrom two requests randr0exchanging their respective as-\nsociated QSs qandq0in\u0011. Formally, given a matching \u0011,\ntwo submitted requests r;r02 R and two QSs q;q02 Q\nwith (r;q);(r0;q0)2\u0011, a swap matching is deﬁned as\n\u0011q\nr;r0=\u0011nf(r;q);(r0;q0)g[f (r0;q);(r;q0)g. Accordingly,\nswap stability is deﬁned as:\nDeﬁnition 2 (Swap stability) .A matching\u0011is said to be swap\nstable if no swap matching \u00110=\u0011q\nr;r0exists such that:\n(i) Request randr0prefer the QSs associated in swap\nmatching\u00110over the QSs associated in \u0011. Formally, both prefer\nto swap their respective QSs q0\u001FReq\nrqandq\u001FReq\nr0q0, and\n2Note that swap stability is not to be confused with the enta\nective QSs q0\u001FReq\nrqandq\u001FReq\nr0q0, and\n2Note that swap stability is not to be confused with the entanglement swap\noperation that a QS can perform on two link-level EPR pairs.Algorithm 1 Request-QS Association (RQSA)\nRequire: Set of requestsR, set of QSsQ.\nPhase 1: Initialization Phase\n1:Each requestrk;m\nldetermines its worst-case ﬁdelities from (7)\n2:Match each request rk;m\nlto the QSqwith the highest worst-case ﬁdelity as long\nas constraints (6b) and (6c) are satisﬁed.\nPhase 2: Swap Matching Phase\n3:repeat\n4: for allr2R do\n5: Select a QSq0that yields a higher utility then the currently matched QS q\n6: for all Requestsr0matched to QS q0, i.e.,r02R\u0011\nq0do\n7: QSq0identiﬁes a request r0that shares the same Tx or Rx node with\nrequestrwhich is not matched to q0\n8: ifq\u001FReq\nr0q0andq0\u001FReq\nrqthen\n9: Construct the swap matching \u00110 \u0011q\nr;r 0\n10: ifR\u00110\nq\u001FQS\nqR\u0011\nqandR\u00110\nq0\u001FQS\nq0R\u0011\nq0and (6b),(6c) are satisﬁed\nthen\n11: The swap ofr0andris approved, i.e., \u0011 \u00110\n12: else\n13: The swap ofr0andris denied.\n14: end if\n15: end if\n16: end for\n17: end for\n18: until no more pairs of requests r;r0to swap are found\n19: All QSsq2Q solveP1from (6a) to determine the action for each request\nStage 3: e2e EPR Pair Generation Phase\n20: Each QS performs its respective actions to create e2e EPR pairs according to \u0011\n(ii) QSq2 Q andq0prefer the requests associated in\nswap matching \u00110over the requests associated in \u0011. Formally,\nR\u00110\nq\u001FQS\nqR\u0011\nqandR\u00110\nq\u001FQS\nq0R\u0011\nq0.\nTo solve the proposed matching game, i.e. ﬁnding a swap\nstable matching \u0011, a key challenge is that the preferences (8)\nof the QSs do not rank individual requests, but rather sets of\nrequests. Accordingly, a QS q2 Q cannot decide whether\nto accept or defer an individual request. Instead, the QS has\nto consider all its other associated requests in R\u0011\nq. Further-\nmore, instead of having a ﬁxed quota at each QS, we must\nconsider the limited quantum memory of each QS given by\nconstraints (6b) and (6c). Therefore, the well-known deferred\nacceptance algori\n of each QS given by\nconstraints (6b) and (6c). Therefore, the well-known deferred\nacceptance algorithm [14] cannot be applied to this game.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a novel request-\nQS association (RQSA) swap matching algorithm, which is\nshown in Algorithm 1. The matching is initialized by a greedy\nstrategy, i.e., all submitted requests are matched to QSs with\nthe highest request utility (3) as long as constraints (6b)\nand (6c) are satisﬁed for each QS (lines 1 and 2). After\ninitialization, the swap matching phase begins. The preference\nlist of each request ris calculated and a more preferred QS\nq0than its currently matched QS qis identiﬁed (line 5). QS q0\nidentiﬁes a request r0from its associated requests that shares\nthe same Tx or Rx node with another request rnot associated\ntoq0(line 7). Then swap matching \u0011q\nr;r0is considered, wherein\nrwill be served by q0instead ofq2Q andr0will be served\nbyq2Q instead ofq0(line 8). The swap is performed when\nthe requests randr0and QSsqandq0prefer the swap, with at\nleast one participant strictly preferring the swap matching over\nits current matching (line 7-16). This procedure is repeated\nuntil no more swaps can be found in the network (line 17). In\nthe last stage, the e2e EPR pair generation phase, the QSs solve\noptimization problem P1, identify and perform the actions toserve their associated requests (lines 18 and 19). The stability\nof the resulting matching \u0011follows from:\nLemma 1. Upon convergence, RQSA reaches a swap stable\nmatching according to Deﬁnition 2.\nProof: To prove swap stability upon convergence, we have\nto show that no pair of submitted requests randr0exists with\ntheir associated QSs qandq0, such that a swap of randr0is\npreferred by the submitted requests and QSs. RQSA checks for\nall combinations of r;r0;qandq0, whether a swap is preferred\nby all requests and QSs. If such a combination of r;r0;qand\nq0is found, the swap is performed. This procedure is repeated\nuntil no more swaps are performed. Th\n\nq0is found, the swap is performed. This procedure is repeated\nuntil no more swaps are performed. Therefore, after the swap\nmatching phase, the resulting matching \u0011is swap stable as no\nmore pairs of submitted requests remain that would prefer to\nbe served by another QS.3\nIV. S IMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nFor our simulations, we deﬁne the following default setup\nQCN parameters: 1) The number of Tx nodes is K= 5,\nthe number of Rx nodes is M= 5, while the number of\nQSs isQ= 3 ; 2) Heralding stations perform n= 10\nlink-level EPR pair generation attempts, and the numbers of\nsuccessfully-generated pairs in every time slot are binomial\nrandom variables NTx\nk;q\u0018B(n= 10;p=pk;q)andNRx\nq;m\u0018\nB(n= 10;p=pq;m)(see Sec. II). The probability of success\nispk;q=e\u0000dk;q=L0, for links between a QS q2Q and a\nTx nodek2K, whereL0= 0:54 km is the optical ﬁber’s\nattenuation coefﬁcient [17], and dk;qis the length of those\nlinks. Similarly, pq;m=e\u0000dq;m=L0for links between a QS\nqand an Rx node m2M . The lengths dk;qanddq;mare\nsampled from a uniform distribution between 100 m and1 km ,\nU(0:1;1); 3) Each request has a different minimum required ﬁ-\ndelityFmin\nk;mbased on its intended quantum application.4Thus,\nwe randomly sample such values from a uniform distribution\nU(0:5;0:8); 4) Initial ﬁdelities FTx\nk;qandFRx\nq;mof link-level\nEPR pairs depend on the hardware, so they are sampled from\na uniform distribution U(0:83;0:99)[17]; 5) The number of\nsubmitted requests lies in the range R2[0;40]. We perform\n100 independent simulation runs wherein all aforementioned\nrandom variables are drawn from their respective distributions.\nEach run analyzes a single time slot where Tx nodes submit\na set of requests, that we solve the request-QS association\nproblem for. Unless stated otherwise, these default parameters\nare used in all simulation experiments.\nWe benchmark the proposed RQSA algorithm against the\nfollowing baselines: 1) Optimal , which formulates the request-\nQS association problem as an integer opt\nowing baselines: 1) Optimal , which formulates the request-\nQS association problem as an integer optimization problem\nsolved using an advanced solver [18]. This requires complete\nQCN information that is impractical due to classical commu-\nnication delay, 2) Greedy algorithm , which selects the QS with\nthe highest worst-case ﬁdelity to serve a request, and when it\nlacks enough link-level EPR pairs, the next-best QS is chosen,\nand 3) Random algorithm , which randomly associates each\nrequest with a QS. We discuss the experimental results next.\n3Regarding the proof of convergence, we refer the reader to a general proof\nfor swap matching algorithms in [12] due to space limitations.\n4Particularly, distillation protocols require a minimum ﬁdelity of 0:5, while\n0:8is a typical value for quantum key distribution applications [9].10 20 30 40\nNumber of submitted requests R0255075100Served requests (%)Optimal\nRQSAGreedy\nRandomFig. 2.

Average percentage of served requests as\na function of K,MandR.\n1) Impact of Number of Requests on Served Requests: First,\nwe analyze, the performance as the number Rof submitted\nrequests varies, and compare the percentage of served requests\nby the different algorithms. Corresponding results are shown\nin Fig. 2, where we observe that RQSA is within 5%of the\noptimal solution in terms of served requests. Moreover, RQSA\nachieves superior performance compared to both greedy and\nrandom algorithms, and the performance gap between the\nalgorithms increases as the number of requests increases. For\ninstance, when the number of submitted requests is 40, RQSA\nserves around 13% and22% more requests than the greedy and\nrandom algorithm\nted requests is 40, RQSA\nserves around 13% and22% more requests than the greedy and\nrandom algorithms, respectively. From Fig. 2, we also observe\nthat the optimal percentage of served requests decreases as\nthe number of requests increases. This is due to limited QCN\nresources, namely link-level Tx/Rx EPR pairs, which leads to\nmany submitted requests becoming infeasible as more requests\nare submitted.\n2) Impact of Number of Requests on Overall QS Utility:\nNext, we show the effect of Ron the overall achieved QSs’\nutility, i.e., sum of served e2e ﬁdelities , in Fig. 3. We observe\nfrom Fig. 3 that RQSA achieves near-optimal performance,\neven for large R, e.g.,R= 40 . In such cases, RQSA achieves\na performance within 5%of the optimal overall utility, unlike\nthe greedy and random algorithms that start to diverge from\nthe optimal solution as Rbecomes large. Note that, in contrast\nto the optimal solution algorithm, RQSA requires signiﬁcantly\nsmaller run time, and does not require full QCN information\navailability while being scalable.\n3) Impact of QCN Size on Performance: Finally, in Fig. 4,\nwe analyze the scalability of RQSA by showing the percentage\nof served requests as Rvaries while considering three different\nQCN sizes. In particular, we consider the cases in which K \u003E\nM,K=M, andK \u003C M for a ﬁxed number of QSs Q=\n3. From Fig. 4, for small QCNs, e.g., K= 3, we observe\nthat a small number of Tx nodes imposes a bottleneck on\nthe maximum number of served requests, since the number of\navailable link-level EPR pairs becomes insufﬁcient to satisfy\nthe increased number of requests. Additionally, we observe\nfrom Fig. 4 that RQSA is scalable across different (small and\nlarge) QCN sizes, and it achieves a near-optimal performance,\nthat is within 4%of the optimal solution.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have studied the problem of requests-QSs\nassociation in QCNs with multiple QSs, which is crucial forQCN applications like quantum data centers. To develop a\npractical solution and\n which is crucial forQCN applications like quantum data centers. To develop a\npractical solution and overcome the challenges of partial in-\nformation and the combinatorial complexity of the association\nproblem, we have formulated the problem as a matching game.\nThe proposed formulation takes into account practical QCN\nconsiderations such as limited memory capacity, heteroge-\nneous ﬁdelity requirements, and scheduling of QS operations.\nMoreover, we have developed a novel swap-matching based\nRQSA algorithm to solve the matching game while achieving\nstability. Simulation results show that the proposed approach\nis scalable and achieves a near-optimal performance.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Chehimi and W.

INTRODUCTION\nMany quantum information processing tasks, especially\nin quantum computing and in quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum communication, rely on systems that canserve as quantum memories, i.e., can store states of qubitsfor extended periods of time, and processors, i.e., allowfor quantum logic gates to be performed on the storedqubits. Of the many candidate technologies for quantum in-formation storage, solid-state quantum memories based oncolor-center defects in diamond have emerged as leading can-didates [ 1–5], especially because these systems promise long\ncoherence times, high-ﬁdelity single-qubit gates, efﬁcientqubit-photon interfaces, and in-principle highly scalable real-izations. Inte\ne-qubit gates, efﬁcientqubit-photon interfaces, and in-principle highly scalable real-izations. Integration of these defect centers into nanophotonicwaveguides promises a scalable pathway for the develop-ment of fault-tolerant quantum repeaters—either with the spinqubits themselves acting as quantum memories [ 6], or where\nthe spin qubits are used to produce photonic cluster states thatact like quantum memories [ 7]—which would serve as the\nbackbone of the quantum internet.\nCandidate spin vacancies in diamond comprise two major\nclasses—the nitrogen vacancy (NV) or a group IV vacancy(G4V), where the candidate defect atom is either silicon(Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), or lead (Pb) [ 8–17]. While\nNVs have been used in pioneering demonstrations of veriﬁ-able shared entanglement generation [ 18,19], problems with\n*prajitd@arizona.edu\n†saikat@arizona.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The inversion symmetric vacancy hasa negligible susceptibility to electronic charge noise, withnear-deterministic implantation of defects promising scalabledevice manufacturing [ 20]. Demonstrations of memory en-\nhanced quantum communications [ 21] and long coherence\ntimes approaching 2 sec [ 22] are a few key reasons for in-\ncreased interest in these systems. Phonon coupling is themajor source of decoherence in these systems at “high”temperatures [ 23], necessitating the operation of typical ex-\nperiments at 150 mK or lower, something which must bemitigated for scalable network deployments. Heavier defectssuch as the tin-v\n something which must bemitigated for scalable network deployments. Heavier defectssuch as the tin-vacancy (SnV) serve as promising candi-dates for higher temperature operation, however, a deepunderstanding of phonon decoherence is crucial for the ef-fective utilization of this class of vacancies. Previous studiesinto the effect of spin-phonon coupling have quantiﬁed andcorroborated theoretically predicted decoherence rates withexperimental predictions. However, a complete dynamicalcharacterization of the underlying quantum state through a\nmaster equation or similar state evolution maps has been lack-ing in the literature.

ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATION OF GROUP-IV\nVACANCIES IN DIAMOND\nThe wavelength of the principal optical transition in\nG4Vs—closely related to its ground and excited-statesplitting—is defect-atomic-species dependent. Besides in-terfaces for single photon generation, G4Vs are promisingplatforms for quantum information processing, which is aidedby its split ground level electronic manifold.\nThe ground level manifold (represented in the literature\n[28,29] and in Fig. 1as\n2Eg) is a fourfold degenerate energy\nlevel with an orbital and a spin degree of freedom. The Hilbertspace for\n2Egcan be expressed as H=Horbital⊗Hspin, where\nHorbital is the orbital subsystem and Hspinis the spin subsys-\ntem, both of which are two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Thebasis states of H\norbital are expressed as |eg\n+/angbracketrightand|eg\n−/angbracketright, whereas\nforHspin,t h e ya r e |↑/angbracketrightand|↓/angbracketright. Since we limit the discussionto the ground-state manifold, we may henceforth drop the g\nsuperscript for the orbital basis states, i.e., |eg\n±/angbracketright≡| e±/angbracketright.H o w -\never, ﬁne structure splitting in the spectra of these systems arenot attributable to these bare levels, i.e., they must account foradditional interactions.

Theoretical and experimental [ 8,28]\nstudies have attributed the splitting in these systems to threemajor interactions, that we shall review and formulate in for-mal notation subsequently.\nA.

Jahn-Teller interaction\nThis effect introduces distortion of the electronic orbitals\ndue to an asymmetric potential, leading to orbital energy shifts[31,32]. The Jahn-Teller effect, is less prominent than spin-\norbit coupling, and is a spin-independent interaction with aninteraction Hamiltonian of the form\nH\nJT=[ϒxˆYorb.−ϒyˆXorb.]⊗ˆIspin, (2a)\nwhere ϒx,ϒyrepresent the effective energies associated\nwith the distorted potential along the x,ydirections (in\nthe cardinal frame), respectively, and ˆYorb.=i|e+/angbracketright/angbracketlefte−|−\ni|e−/angbracketright/angbracketlefte+|,ˆXorb.=|e+/angbracketright/angbracketlefte−|+|e−/angbracketright/angbracketlefte+|.\nC. Zeeman splitting\nZeeman splitting is observed when external magnetic ﬁelds\nlift the spin-degeneracy of electronic defect [ 33]. There are\ntwo distinct effects dependent on the direction of the ﬁeld,which may be parallel ( B\n/bardbl) or perpendicular ( B⊥) to the high-\nsymmetry axis of the defect center. The parallel ﬁeld yields aneffective Hami\nlar ( B⊥) to the high-\nsymmetry axis of the defect center. The parallel ﬁeld yields aneffective Hamiltonian,\nH\nZ,/bardbl=γe\n2·Iorb.⊗B/bardblˆZspin.

Speciﬁcally, we\n013055-2PHONON-INDUCED DECOHERENCE IN COLOR-CENTER … PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH 6, 013055 (2024)\nconsider the scenario where the Jahn-Teller effect is negligible\n(ϒx,ϒy/lessmuchλSO) and the system experiences an on-axis mag-\nnetic ﬁeld ( B=B/bardbl;B⊥=0) [29].

Readers may refer toAppendix Afor detailed descriptions of these level structures.\nIII. MASTER EQUATION SETUP FOR ELECTRON\nSPIN-PHONON COUPLING\nAccounting for dissipation and decoherence in qubits is\ncrucial to evaluate the utility of these systems in practicalsettings. Starting with the nondissipative description of aquantum system, ad hoc introduction of dissipative t\ntarting with the nondissipative description of aquantum system, ad hoc introduction of dissipative terms willviolate the canonical commutation rules [ 34,35] of underlying\noperators. Dissipation in a quantum system can be analyzedusing various techniques; we consider a Born-Markov masterequation-based approach for the purposes of the currentarticle.\nIn particular, we are interested in the evolution of a system\nof interest, represented by the density operator ρ\nsys.G i v e n\nsolely the Hamiltonian Hsyswith no additional interactions,\nthe evolution of the state of the system can be solved for ineither the Schrödinger or Heisenberg formalism. However,any decoherence or dissipation requires the introduction ofan environment system initialized as the state ρ\nenvwith the\nHamiltonian Henv, and an interaction Hamiltonian Hint.T h e\nevolution of the total system, ρtot=ρsys⊗ρenvunder the\ntotal Hamiltonian Htot=Hsys+Henv+Hintis analytically ex-\npressible; however, obtaining general solutions to the stateevolution is generally intractable. Under the assumptions ofinitial state separability for a “large” invariant environmentstate (Born approximation), and memoryless evolution of thesystem density operator (Markov approximation), a Born-Markov master equation may be derived for the evolution ofρ\nsys.\nFor the current study, we want to examine the major cause\nof qubit decoherence in G4Vs induced by phonon-coupling tothe electronic spin-orbital levels. Experimental studies havepredicted the spin-phonon coupling effect to be the majorcause of decoherence at high temperatures [ 23]; in fact, as\nhighlighted previously, most experiments eliminate the effectby ‘freezing’ the phonon bath by operating at suitable temper-atures (typically ∼150 mK or below, for SiV color centers).\nTo develop an analytical model for qubit decoher-\nence, we begin by considering the complete electronicHamiltonian,\nH\nsys=¯h/Delta1/2(|4/angbracketright/angbracketleft4|−|2/angbracketright/angbracketleft2|+|3/angb\nn,\nH\nsys=¯h/Delta1/2(|4/angbracketright/angbracketleft4|−|2/angbracketright/angbracketleft2|+|3/angbracketright/angbracketleft3|−|1/angbracketright/angbracketleft1|), (7)\nwhere /Delta1=λSOis the frequency corresponding to the total en-\nergy splitting between {|1/angbracketright,|3/angbracketright}and{|2/angbracketright,|4/angbracketright}(for details see\nFIG. 2. Phonon coupling with split levels of the ground-state\nmanifold of the G4V center.\nAppendix Aand Refs. [ 11,28]).

Appendix Bhas fur-\nther details.\nBefore we proceed with a numerical simulation of the sys-\ntem, we draw some insights on the derived master equation.In particular, we can focus on the dynamics of a two-levelsystem (TLS) coupled to a bosonic thermal environment [ 34].\nThe system, environment and interaction Hamiltonians forthis system are given by\nH\nsys=¯hωA(|e/angbracketright\n, environment and interaction Hamiltonians forthis system are given by\nH\nsys=¯hωA(|e/angbracketright/angbracketlefte|−|g/angbracketright/angbracketleftg|),\nHenv=/summationdisplay\nm¯hωma†\nmam,and\nHint=/summationdisplay\nm¯hχm(|e/angbracketright/angbracketleftg|am+|g/angbracketright/angbracketlefte|a†\nm), (12)\nwhere {|e/angbracketright,|g/angbracketright}are the excited- and ground-state levels of the\nTLS separated by energy of ¯ hωA. The bosonic environment\nis a collection of modes labeled by m, with the correspond-\ning creation (annihilation) operators given by am(a†\nm). The\ninteraction between the TLS and the bosonic mode is coupledby the interaction strength coefﬁcient χ\nm. A commonly ana-\nlyzed situation is the evolution of the system density operator(denoted by ρ\n(TL)\nsys) when the environment is in a collective\nthermal state [similar to Eq. ( 9), with mode index mreplacing\n{p,k}].

It is\neasy to note that Eqs. ( 11) and ( 13) are quite similar; the\ngeneral master equation for the color center is composed oftwo TLSs. Namely, the pair of levels {|1/angbracketright,|3/angbracketright}and{|2/angbracketright,|4/angbracketrig\ny, the pair of levels {|1/angbracketright,|3/angbracketright}and{|2/angbracketright,|4/angbracketright}\ncorrespond, respectively, to the levels {|g/angbracketright,|e/angbracketright}of Eq. ( 13).\nThis does not mean that all the analysis valid for Eq. ( 13)\nnecessarily caries over to the analysis of decoherence usingEq. ( 11). However, one may draw parallels between the two\nsystems for added intuition. The TLS’s decay rate (transferfrom|e/angbracketright→| g/angbracketrightstate) of /Gamma1(¯n+1)/2 is similar in form to the\norbital decay rate (from |4/angbracketright→| 2/angbracketrightand|3/angbracketright→| 1/angbracketright) for G4Vs.\nThis corresponds to an effective qubit dephasing rate since theorbital state decay does not affect the spin character whereasfor the TLS model it is similar to an amplitude dampingchannel on the qubit [ 38]. The evolution of the G4V electronic\nstates also proceeds similar to the TLS state evolution due tothe similarity in the form of the master equation.\nIV . STATE ANALYSIS METHODS\nA. Multisystem state evolution\nThe master equation for the phonon-coupled evolution in\nEq. ( 11) governs the evolution of a single vacancy center.\nSpeciﬁcally, given an initial system state ρ(t=t1)≡ρinit.at\nt=t1, one may interpret the time evolution up to t=t2as a\nquantum channel acting on the system. In this formalism, wecompactly express the state evolution in terms of the Lindbla-dian for Eq. ( 11)a s\nL\nt2−t1[ρinit.]=ρ(t2). (14)\nFor the general treatment of Nsuch quantum systems, the\nevolution of the joint spin state ρ(N)\ninit.in the interval t∈[t1,t2]\nis expressed as\nL(N)\nt2−t1[ρ(N)]:=N/summationdisplay\nk=1Lk\nt2−t1/bracketleftbig\nρ(N)\ninit./bracketrightbig\n(15a)\n≡N/summationdisplay\nk=1I⊗k−1⊗Lt2−t1⊗I⊗N−k/bracketleftbig\nρ(N)\ninit./bracketrightbig\n,(15b)\nwhere we use Lk\nt2−t1to represent the Lindbladian of the chan-\nnel acting on the kth system and an identity map Ion the\nremaining N−1 system.

Alternatively, we may prescribe a quantum channel\nfor the decoherence with the aid of an operator sum represen-tation of the channel evolution over some speciﬁc time.

State quality evaluation\nFor our analysis of the quantum states under deco-\nherence, we shall use two speciﬁc metrics to evalu-ate the ﬁnal state quality, namely the state ﬁdelity andthe hashing bound. The state ﬁdelity F (ρ\n1,ρ2) between\ntwo quantum states ρ1andρ2evaluates their “over-\nlap” as F(ρ1,ρ2)=Tr(/radicalbig√ρ1ρ2√ρ1)2, which simpliﬁes to\nF(ρ1,ρ2)=/angbracketleft/Psi12|ρ1|/Psi12/angbracketrightifρ2=|/Psi12/angbrac\n1)2, which simpliﬁes to\nF(ρ1,ρ2)=/angbracketleft/Psi12|ρ1|/Psi12/angbracketrightifρ2=|/Psi12/angbracketright/angbracketleft/Psi12|. Fidelity is a re-\nliable and insightful state quality indicator, and generally easyto evaluate. However, the “similarity” of states is only applica-ble in the regime where F(ρ\n1,ρ2)→1. More task-dependent\nquantities must be used for state utility analysis, e.g., forquantum communications.\nFor the evaluation of bipartite entanglement quality, in-\nformation theoretic quantities to evaluate (or bound) thedistillable entanglement of the state are more insightful. Dis-tillable entanglement, represented by E\nD(ρAB), quantiﬁes the\nnumber of perfect entangled pairs (Bell pairs) that can bedistilled from ρ\nAB, assuming both parties have ideal universal\nquantum computers (using an arbitrary nonspeciﬁed distilla-tion circuit) and unlimited two-way classical communications.For general states, E\nD(ρAB) is nontrivial to evaluate; for the\npresent study we will use the hashing bound I(ρAB), which\nis a lower bound to the state’s distillable entanglement and iscalculated for the general bipartite state ρ\nABas\nI(ρAB)=min[ S(ρA)−S(ρAB),S(ρB)−S(ρAB)], (18)\nwhere ρA=TrB(ρAB),ρB=TrA(ρAB), and S(ρ)i st h ev o n\nNeumann entropy of the state ρ.\nAnalysis of state decoherence shall be focused on two\naspects—(1) the evolution of a single vacancy system whosequbit manifold is initialized in an arbitrary single qubit stateand (2) the evolution of a pair of vacancy centers whose qubitmanifold are entangled through a heralded photonic entan-glement swap. For the single qubit analysis, we evaluate thequality of a qubit initialized in an equal superposition state.For the latter, we analyze the decoherence of ideal Bell states,as well as realistic models of spin qubits in an entangled pairgenerated by heralded entangelement swaps [ 26]. The degra-\ndation of the state’s hashing bound is our metric of choice forthis study.\nV . SPIN DECOHERENCE ANALYSIS\nA. Single spin\nFor a \ning bound is our metric of choice forthis study.\nV . SPIN DECOHERENCE ANALYSIS\nA. Single spin\nFor a preliminary understanding of our model, we begin by\nconsidering the single spin qubit case. We initialize our spinto the equal superposition state, |ψ(0)/angbracketright=(|1/angbracketright+| 2/angbracketright)/√\n2.\nFIG. 3. Evolution of the single spin-state coherence\n/angbracketleft↓|ρ(t)|↑/angbracketright= /angbracketleft↑| ρ(t)|↓/angbracketrightinitialized in the |ψ(t=0)/angbracketright=(|1/angbracketright+|2/angbracketright)/√\n2 state. We look at (a) dependence of /angbracketleft↓|ρ(t)|↑/angbracketright at various\nvalues of bath temperature ( T) and maximum time, and (b) extract\nthe decay time constant by ﬁtting to the expected relation/angbracketleft↑|ρ(t)|↓/angbracketright= 0.5×exp(−t/τ\nC,1). We assume /Delta1=50 GHz\n(corresponding to Si vacancies in diamond).\nEvolution for some amount of time tunder the spin-phonon\ncoupled bath model will lead to a mixed state of the spin,which we label by ρ(t). We seek to characterize the action\nof decoherence by studying the decay of off-diagonalterm of the electron-spin qubit’s density matrix, i.e., either/angbracketleft↓|ρ(t)|↑/angbracketrightor/angbracketleft↑|ρ(t)|↓/angbracketright, commonly referred to as the spin\ncoherence term. The spin degree of freedom is separated\nfrom the orbital state by “tracing out” the orbital degreeof freedom, i.e., by mapping the states {|3/angbracketright,|1/angbracketright} → |↓/angbracketright\nand{|4/angbracketright,|2/angbracketright} → |↑/angbracketright . We expect an exponentially decay\nof the form /angbracketleft↑|ρ(t)|↓/angbracketright = 0.5×exp(−t/τ\nC,1).

The reader maynote that τ\nC,1is equally valid for evaluating the ﬁdelity of\nthe state ρ(t). This is simply because the state ﬁdelity is\nevaluated as /angbracketleftψ(0)|ρ(t)|ψ(0)/angbracketright=0.5+0.5e x p (−t/τC,1),\nsince the diagonal terms are unaffected by the phononinteraction. Additional analysis for heavier G4Vs has beenperformed in Appendix D.\nB. Ideal Bell pair\nWe extend the analysis by looking the evolution of two\nspins which are initialized in the entangled state |ψ(2)(0)/angbracketright=\n(|1,2/angbracketright+| 2,1/angbracketright)/√\n2. We assume that no time lapses in the\ninitialization of the spin state, and we are able to examine thejoint state’s decoherence from t=0. We evaluate the hashing\nbound I[ρ(t)] and proceed similarly to the analysis of the\nsingle spin state. Readers should note that the evolution of thejoint two-spin state follows the dynamical map formulated inEqs. ( 15). Figure 4(a) plots the overall decay of I[ρ(t)] for a\nrange of bath temperatures T. Similar to our analysis of the\nsingle qubit coherence in Sec. VA, we expect an exponential\ndecay of I(ρ(t)) with time, i.e., I[ρ(t)]=exp(−t/τ\nC,2). We\nextract τC,2through numerical ﬁtting, in Fig. 4(b) for speci-\nﬁed values of T. An inverse relation between TandτC,2is\nobserved, which corroborates the observations we made forthe single spin evolution. We note that τ\nC,2\u003Cτ C,1for all T.\nC. Distributed entangled states\nSolid-state spin-based defects are promising candidates for\nthe generation of entanglement over a network. Unlike thegeneration of local entanglement where the joint state can beused and analyzed from the moment of initialization, acco\nl entanglement where the joint state can beused and analyzed from the moment of initialization, account-ing for network latency is key for states generated/distributedremotely. This is apparent by considering the simple “mid-point entanglement swap” architecture [depicted in Fig. 5(a)]\nwhich is one of two canonical setups for entanglement genera-tion/distribution over a quantum link [ 26,27,39]. As depicted\nin Fig. 5(a), the midpoint swap link involves two parties\nAlice (A) and Bob (B), who generate a photonic qubit(brown wavepacket) entangled with their spin qubit (purplecircle), which we label as σ\nspin,photon . The photonic qubit is\nthen transmitted to the “midpoint” (blue diamond) where anentanglement swap takes place. We assume that A and Bare separated by a physical network length of L. Assuming\nthat the speed of light in the medium is c\nm, and the point\nof generation of the spin-photonic qubit entanglement is at\nt=0, it takes t=L/(2cm)≡t1for the photons to travel to the\nmidpoint for the entanglement swap. Hence, for T∈[0,t1],\nwe account for decoherence of the individual spins using acomposite channel on the joint spin-photonic qubit state, say.This channel takes the form\nσ\nspin,photon→Lt1−0,spin⊗Iphoton [σspin,photon ].

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\nThe task of quantifying the effect of decoherence for quan-\ntum memories is crucial in understanding their utility in avariety of tasks. Speciﬁcally for applications dependent onshared entanglement, the quali\ntility in avariety of tasks. Speciﬁcally for applications dependent onshared entanglement, the quality of the distribute state is im-portant. Our study on the complete master equation modelingfor spin-phonon coupling G4Vs in diamond promotes thenecessity to understand the complete quantum state dynamics.We have developed a prescription to track and quantify thestate’s density operator. Further processing of spin qubits,for tasks such as intramemory entanglement swap (which\nare required for repeater networks), entanglement distillation(to boost the quality of the shared entangled states), ordistributed quantum computing, would be greatly informedby the complete density operator. Our study is uniquein this approach to close the gap between theoreticalpredictions and various experimental characterizations ofvarious G4Vs.\nPhonon coupling is one part of a multitude of decoher-\nence factors relevant to spin qubits based on defect centersin diamond. The effect of the host material’s nuclear spinbath in the decoherence of the qubit has been omitted in thisstudy. The vacancy atom’s local nuclear spin environment alsobrings in some non-Markovian characteristics in the evolutionof the system. Changes in the experimental setup, for, e.g., us-ing off-axis magnetic ﬁelds and mechanical strain tuning ofspin vacancies also modify the electronic structure of thesesystems in nontrivial ways. Accounting for these effects inconjunction with phonon coupling in more detailed modelswill be promising for a variety of applications. We hope thattechniques that have been illustrated by our study will moti-vate such future studies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Christos N. Gagatsos (Univ. of Arizona), Kevin\nC.

Spin-orbit coupling\nThe spin-orbit coupling is a relativistic interaction of the\nelectronic orbital with the nuclear potential of the defect atom.Normally a rotation invariant interaction, the crystal ﬁeld ofthe host diamond breaks the symmetry for group IV vacanciesto yield an interaction that affect orbital eigenstates with en-ergy shifts (without mixing) of the spin-levels. The spin-orbitcoupling Hamiltonian H\nSOis given as\nHSO=−λSO\n2(−|e+/angbracketright/angbracketlefte+|+|e−/angbracketright/angbracketlefte−|)⊗(|↑/angbracketright /angbracketleft↑| − |↓/angbracketright/angbracketleft↓| )\n(A2a)\n=+λSO\n2·ˆZorb.⊗ˆZspin, (A2b)\nwhere λSOis the spin-orbit coupling strength with ˆZorb.=\n(|e+/angbracketright/angbracketlefte+|−|e−/angbracketright/angbracketlefte−|) and ˆZspin=| ↑ /angbracketright /angbracketleft ↑ |−| ↓ /angbracketright /angbracketleft ↓ | .

Zeeman splitting\nZeeman splitting is observed when external magnetic ﬁelds\nlifts spin-degeneracy of the system. There are two distincteffects dependent on the direction of the ﬁeld, which maybe parallel ( B\n/bardbl) or perpendicular ( B⊥) to the high symmetry\naxis ([1 ,1,1] direction) of the defect center. The parallel ﬁeld\nyields an effective Hamiltonian,\nHZ,/bardbl=γe\n2·ˆIorb.⊗B/bardblˆZspin.

Heavier group IVvacancy centers such as the germanium (Ge) [ 14,20,43],\ntin (Sn) [ 11,12], and lead (Pb) [ 13,16] vacancies in dia-\nmond are being explored in several parallel efforts acrossthe world for their reduced susceptibility to phonon-induced\nTABLE I.

The following splitting values have beencalculated and experimentally measured and are presented inTable I.\nWe extend the analysis from Sec. VA for the heavier\nvacancy centers in Fig. 10to obtain the single spin-state coher-\nence/angbracketleft↓|ρ(t)|↑/angbracketright =/angbracketleft↑| ρ(t)|↓/angbracketrightas function of temperature and\ntime for an initial qubit state |ψ(t=0)/angbracketright=(|1/angbracketright+| 2/angbracketright)/√\n2.\nWe plot the extracted coherence decay time constant inFig. 11—we note that equivalent coherence times areobserved for higher temperatures, as th\nonstant inFig. 11—we note that equivalent coherence times areobserved for higher temperatures, as the defect center’s\nspin-orbit splitting becomes larger. The same holds truefor two-qubit entanglement decay (similar to Fig. 4)o r\nover a network (from Figs. 6and 7). Overall, utilizing a\nheavier vacancy center species would potentially allow forless stringent operating conditions. Additional operationaldifﬁculties (such as in sample fabrication, faithful qubitmanipulation and high-efﬁciency photon collection) mayarise in using these other emitters; however they are out ofthe scope of this present article.\n[1] C.

Performing\nBSMs on Werner states shared between repeaters leads to\nexponential decay in the fidelity of the end-to-end Werner state\nwith the number of repeaters, necessitating entanglement distilla-\ntion. Generally, entanglement routing protocols use probabilistic\ndistillation techniques based on local operations and classical\ncommunication. In this work, we use quantum error correcting\ncodes (QECCs) for deterministic entanglement distillation to route\nWerner states on a chain of repeaters. To maximize the end-\nto-end distillable entanglement, which depends on the number\nand fidelity of end-to-end Bell pairs, we utilize global link-\nstate knowledge to determine the optimal policy for scheduling\ndistillation and BSMs at the repeaters. We analyze the effect\nof the QECC’s properties on the entanglement rate and the\nnumber of quantum memories. We observe that low-rate codes\nproduce high-fidelity end-to-end states owing to their excellent\nerror-correcting capability, whereas high-rate codes yield a larger\nnumber of end-to-end states but of lower fidelity. The number\nof quantum memories used at repeaters increases with the code\nrate as well as the classical computation time of the QECC’s\ndecoder.\nIndex Terms —Quantum networks, entanglement distillation,\nquantum error correction, entanglement routing\nI.

Quantum networks aim to\nprovide shared entanglement between remote parties. Special\npurpose nodes called quantum repeaters [1], are used to\nroute entanglement in the network. The quantum repeaters\nstore the qubits either in matter-based quantum memories\n[2], [3] or using quantum error-correcting codes on photonic\ngraph states [4], [5], and can perform quantum circuits and\nmeasurements on the stored qubits.\nIn a typical entanglement routing protocol, shared entan-\nglement is generated by creating Bell states between quantum\nThis work was co-funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF)\nERC Center for Quantum Networks under grant number 1941583 and NSF\ngrant number CIF-2106189.

Entanglement routing protocols can be classified\ninto two categories: those using ideal Bell states and those\nwith noisy Bell states [9]. In this paper, we focus on designing\nrouting protocols with the latter. We assume that the link-level\nentangled states generated between neighboring repeaters are\nWerner states, i.e., Bell states that have undergone depolarizin\nd between neighboring repeaters are\nWerner states, i.e., Bell states that have undergone depolarizing\nnoise.\nThe fidelity of a Werner state decays exponentially with\nthe number of BSMs it has undergone, making it eventually\nunusable when used for routing in quantum networks. As\na result, the fidelity of Werner states in quantum networks\nmust be boosted periodically. This is precisely the purpose of\nperforming entanglement distillation, which consumes n≥2\nnoisy Bell states to generate k≥1higher fidelity Bell\nstates. Several quantum circuits have been proposed for entan-\nglement distillation [10]–[13]. These circuit-based techniques\nimplement local single- and two-qubit gates and single-qubit\nmeasurements at each node. The measurement results are com-\nmunicated between the nodes to herald distillation, making\nthese techniques probabilistic in nature. The probability of\nsuccessful distillation is proportional to the fidelity of the input\nstates.\nAnother approach to distill entangled states involves using\nquantum error correcting codes (QECC). For an Jn, k, d K\nQECC, nnoisy Bell states are first shared between Alice\nand Bob. One of them, say Alice, measures the QECC’s\nstabilizers on her nqubits and communicates the syndrome\nto Bob through a perfect classical communication channel.\nThen Bob performs error correction on his nqubits by\nmeasuring the same stabilizers and comparing the syndrome\nwith Alice’s. Finally, both of them unencode their qubits to\nobtain kpairs of entangled qubits that are of higher fidelity\ndue to error correction. The QECC-decoder pair determines the\nfidelity of the koutput states. Although quantum circuit-based\nprobabilistic distillation is seemingly different from QECC-\nbased distillation, Bennett et al. [10] showed that these two\nmethods are inter-convertible. Wilde et al. [14] first showed\nthe use of convolutional codes for distillation. Rengaswamy et\nal.

It performs distillation be-\ntween every pair of adjacent repeaters to calculate the number\nof end-to-end entangled states. In this work, we use quantum\nconvolutional and toric codes for entanglement distillation\nalong a chain of repeaters. We map the error correction code\nto an entanglement distillation protocol that always succeeds\nby translating the qubit error probability and the logical error\nrate of the code to infidelities of the input and output states\nfor distillation, respectively. In our protocol, the generation\noflinks , which are Werner states shared between adjacent\nrepeaters, is probabilistic, while the Bell state measurements\nat the repeaters are deterministic. We assume that the quantum\nmemories are perfect. Instead of distilling between every pair\nof repeaters, we have a dynamic scheduling of distillation,\ni.e., we decide which repeaters would perform distillation\nbased on outcomes of link generation. We incorporate a\ncentral processor in our protocol that takes all repeaters’\nlink outcomes as the input to determine the scheduling of\ndistillations along the chain of repeaters. The scheduling uses\nthe total distillable entanglement of the end-to-end states\nshared between Alice and Bob as the cost function. We show\nthat the code rate determines the fidelity and the quantity of\nthe end-to-end states. We also give the timing diagram of our\nprotocol to calculate the latency, and use it to determine the\nquantum memory requirements as a function of the timescales\nof various protocol steps.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews Werner\nstates and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Sec-\ntion III first describes the mapping of QECC to entanglement\ndistillation, followed by the \ns). Sec-\ntion III first describes the mapping of QECC to entanglement\ndistillation, followed by the entanglement routing protocol.\nSection IV compares the entanglement rates and quantum\nmemory requirements for three QECCs with different rates.\nWe conclude by summarizing the main results and future work\nin Section V.\nII.

Since depolarizing noise\nprobabilistically replaces the input state with the completely\nmixed state I, it is information-theoretically the most difficult\nnoise to correct, making it ideal to evaluate the worst-case\nperformance of the distillation protocol.

For a Werner state with fidelity\nF, the distillable entanglement is given by\nD(F) = 1 + Flog2F+ (1−F) log21−F\n3.

Quantum error correction for entanglement distillation\n1) Stabilizer formalism: LetI, X, Y , and Zdenote the\nPauli operators and Gndenote the n-qubit Pauli group, which\nconsists of Kronecker products of these operators along with\nglobal phases from {±1,±ı}, where ı=√−1. Then a\nstabilizer group Sis defined as an Abelian subgroup of\nGnthat does not contain −I. The stabilizer group Sis\ngenerated by a set of n−kindependent generators. If k= 0,\nthenSis called a maximal stabilizer group, and its unique\ncommon +1-eigenstate is called a stabilizer state . When a\nPauli measurement is applied to a stabilizer state, it is possible\nto apply the stabilizer formalism [19], [20] to update Ssuch\nthat the resulting stabilizer group uniquely identifies the post-\nmeasurement state. The Bell state |Φ+\nn⟩AB=|Φ+⟩⊗n\nABis a\nstabilizer state, and its stabilizer group is ⟨XAXB, ZAZB⟩⊗n.\nIt can be shown that |Φ+\nn⟩ABsatisfies the Bell state matrix\nidentity [10]:\n(MA⊗IB)|Φ+\nn⟩AB= (IA⊗MT\nB)|Φ+\nn⟩AB, (6)\nwhere Mis an arbitrary nqubit operator. If Mis a projector,\ni.e.,M2=M, then one can replace MbyM2and apply\nthis property to only one Mso that the operator on the right\nhand side becomes (MA⊗MT\nB). This means that projecting\nAlice’s qubits by Minduces a simultaneous projection of\nBob’s qubits by MT. If Alice’s qubits are projected onto\na stabilizer code via measurements of the stabilizers of the\ncode, then Bob’s qubits are also projected onto an equivalent\n“transpose” code, whose stabilizers are the transposed versions\nof Alice’s stabilizers. Since YT=−Y, the transpose retains\nthe Pauli stabilizers up to a phase factor of −1.2) Stabilizer codes: An Jn, k, d Kstabilizer code is a 2k-\ndimensional subspace Cof the Hilbert space (C2)⊗nthat\nsatisfies the condition S|Ψ⟩=|Ψ⟩ ∀S∈ S,|Ψ⟩ ∈ C .\nThe minimum distance dis defined as the minimum num-\nber of non-identity operators of an element of N(S)\\ S,\nwh\n distance dis defined as the minimum num-\nber of non-identity operators of an element of N(S)\\ S,\nwhere N(S)is the normalizer of SinGn. Each Pauli error\nE∈ Gn\\ N(S)corresponds to a non-trivial syndrome, i,e., a\nvector s∈ {1,−1}n−kwhere the i-th entry is −1if and only if\nEanti-commutes with the i-th generator of S. The syndrome\nis obtained as the result of measurements of the stabilizers of\nthe code. By definition, if E∈ N(S), then s=1. Given a\nnon-trivial syndrome, a decoding algorithm takes the measured\nsyndrome and the set of stabilizers as inputs, and outputs an\nestimate of the corresponding error, ˆE,that is consistent with\nthe syndrome. Then, a recovery is attempted by applying the\nestimated error on the state. If the encoded logical state after\nthe recovery is preserved, i.e., if ˆEE∈ S, then we say that\nthe decoder succeeded; otherwise, if ˆEE∈ N(S)\\ S, then\nwe declare a logical error .\n3) The Toric code: It is a J2d2,2, dKstabilizer code that\ncan be described by a d×dsquare lattice whose opposite\nboundaries are identified with each other (to make a torus).\nHere, qubits reside on edges and the set of stabilizers is\ngiven by the incidence relations between vertices, edges and\nfaces [21]. Specifically, each face or plaquette (resp. vertex)\nrepresents a weight- 4Z-type (resp. X-type) stabilizer acting\non the four incident edges. It can be shown that the minimum\ndistance of the code is indeed the lattice size, d. For decoding\nthe toric code we consider the the minimum-weight perfect-\nmatching (MWPM) decoder [22]. Since this algorithm has a\nhigh decoding latency, we also consider LILLIPUT [23], an\nefficient look-up table decoder for small toric codes.\n4) Quantum convolutional codes: A quantum convolutional\ncode (QCC) is defined by n−kcommuting Pauli sequences\nS0={sj,1≤j≤n−k}, where sjis of length (ν+ 1)n\nandνis called the memory of the code. The full stabilizer\nSis infinite, which contains S0as well as the shifts of S0\nby multiples of nqubits, denoted as Si, i∈N. \ninfinite, which contains S0as well as the shifts of S0\nby multiples of nqubits, denoted as Si, i∈N. In this\npaper we consider the J3,1,3KQCC over F4from [24]. Its\nstabilizer matrix is the generator matrix of a classical rate- 1/3\nquaternary self-orthogonal convolutional code with memory\nν= 1, which is generated by the following generator as well\nas all its shifts by multiples of n= 3 symbols:\ns1=\u00021 1 1 1 ω¯ω\u0003\n. (7)\nNote that ¯ω=ω2in GF(4). To perform the decoding, we use\na quaternary syndrome Viterbi decoder [25].\n5) Entanglement distillation with error correction: Quan-\ntum error correcting codes can be used to perform entangle-\nment distillation [15]. Assume that Alice and Bob want to\nshare high-fidelity Bell pairs, and that Alice can generate n\nWerner states (noisy Bell pairs), each with Werner parameter\nW. The 2nqubits can be represented by the stabilizer group\nSW(|Φ+\nn⟩AB), which has 2ngenerators. Alice projects her\nqubits onto the code space of an Jn, k, d Kstabilizer code by\nmeasuring the n−kstabilizer generators of the code and,using the stabilizer formalism, updates the stabilizer group,\ni.e., the signs of stabilizers. The code Q(S)is then defined\nby the set of stabilizers and the results of the measurements,\nwhich we still call syndrome even though they are random and\ndo not arise from a Pauli error on the state. Due to (6), Bob’s\nqubits will also be projected onto the “transpose” code, and\nhis stabilizers must belong to the evolved group S′\nW. In total,\nthere will be 2(n−k)code stabilizer generators for this group;\nthe remaining 2koperators are not stabilizers, but since they\nall commute with all the stabilizers (due to the evolution of\nthe stabilizer group), they must be logical operators of Alice’s\nand Bob’s qubits. It is possible to conclude that those logical\noperators correspond to logical operators XAXBandZAZB\nfor each of the kencoded Bell pairs (see [15] for more details).\nAfter Alice projects her nhalves of Werner states onto the\ncode space, she c\n[15] for more details).\nAfter Alice projects her nhalves of Werner states onto the\ncode space, she can send Bob’s qubits to him. Since we can see\nWerner states as perfect Bell pairs going through depolarizing\nnoise, we can use (6) to consider Alice’s qubits as perfect Bell\npairs and Bob’s qubits as affected by additional depolarizing\nnoise. Alice then sends the qubits labeled with Bto Bob,\nalong with the syndrome of the stabilizer group after the\nevolution, which are sent through a classical channel. If the\nquantum channel is a depolarizing channel, then the additional\nPauli errors will add on top of Bob’s already corrupted qubits.\nNow, Bob measures all the stabilizer generators on his qubits;\nsince the qubits are already projected onto Q(S)from Alice’s\nmeasurement, the outcome of Bob’s measurement is an error\nsyndrome , which he can use to correct errors using a decoder.\nIf the amount of noise is correctable by the stabilizer code,\nand if the decoder succeeds, then Bob can revert the Pauli\nerrors on his qubits, and the resulting state corresponds to k\nperfect Bell pairs shared between Alice and Bob, encoded in\ntwo Jn, k, d Kquantum stabilizer codes. Otherwise, if a logical\n(uncorrectable) error occurs, one or more of the encoded Bell\nstates will be altered to one of the orthogonal Bell states.\nThis protocol can further be extended to the case where the\nstabilizer code is a quantum convolutional code [14]. After\nperforming the distillation, Alice and Bob can retrieve the\nkdistilled Bell pairs by independently applying the inverse\nencoding circuit of the stabilizer code Q(S)on their nphysical\nqubits.\nIII. T HEGLOBAL LINK-STATE PROTOCOL\nIn this section, we discuss an entanglement routing protocol\nassuming the quantum memory coherence time is longer than\nall other timescales in the network. Hence, the wait times\ndo not affect the quality of Werner states stored in quantum\nmemories. We first discuss using QECCs for entanglement\ndistillation, followed by the routing prot\nm\nmemories. We first discuss using QECCs for entanglement\ndistillation, followed by the routing protocol and its latency.\nA. Entanglement distillation\nSection II-B5 discusses the use of Jn, k, d KQECC to distill\nnWerner states into kWerner states. We now calculate the\noutput fidelity and the success probability of this scheme.\nOur paper utilizes the toric and quantum convolutional\ncodes for entanglement distillation, and decoders (MWPM andFig. 1. The infidelity (1−Fout)of the output Werner state distilled using\nQEC codes vs. infidelity (1−Fin)of the input Werner state. The J3,1,3K\ncode is a quantum convolutional code while the other two are toric codes.\nViterbi) that always converge to a valid error estimate. We then\nmap the decoder’s convergence probability to the distillation\nsuccess probability, resulting in a distillation success prob-\nability of 1 for the toric and quantum convolutional codes.\nHowever, the decoder’s convergence does not ensure a state\nfree of uncorrectable errors, leading to logical errors in the\noutput state. We map the logical error probability of the code\nto the infidelity of the output state(s) of distillation. Similarly,\nthe infidelity of the input state is the error probability in\nthe QECC. We relabel the logical error rate vs. qubit error\nprobability plot for the Jn, k, d KQECC with rate k/n as the\noutput infidelity (1−Fout)vs. the input infidelity (1−Fin)as\nshown in Fig. 1. We assume that the syndrome measurements\non the QECC are perfect. For a given quantum code, there\nexists a threshold fidelity Fthsuch that if Fin\u003C F th, then\nFout\u003C F in, i.e., the quantum code fails to improve the input\nWerner state fidelity. We refer to Fthas the pseudo-threshold\nof the code.\nB. The protocol\nWe have a linear chain of Nrepeaters connecting users\nAlice and Bob at a distance Lfrom each other. We assume\nthat the quantum memories are perfect, i.e. their coherence\ntimes are much larger than all other timescales of the protocol.\nIn every time slot of lengt\nherence\ntimes are much larger than all other timescales of the protocol.\nIn every time slot of length τseconds, each repeater gen-\nerates 2MWerner states and transmits Mqubits from those\nstates over the parallel optical channels on either side. The\nWerner states from adjacent repeaters meet at the intermediate\nnodes and undergo photonic BSM. Each BSM succeeds i.i.d.\nwith probability p. The successful BSMs generate links , i.e.,\nWerner states each with fidelity F0between the quantum\nmemories at each pair of neighboring repeaters. Here, Mis\nthe spatial multiplexing block length. The time required to\ngenerate links is τl=L\n2(N+1)cf, where cfis the speed of\nlight in optical fiber.\nThe network’s link state after an attempt to generate links is\ncalled the snapshot . We use a central processor to incorporate\nglobal link-state knowledge. Once the links are generated,the minor nodes send their link-state to the processor. The\nprocessor uses a brute-force method (see Section III-C) to\ndevise a scheduling strategy for the received snapshot. We\nassume that the classical computation required to calculate the\nscheduling strategy is instantaneous. The scheduling strategy\ndecides which repeaters perform distillation. We refer to\nthose repeaters as the “distillation repeaters”; the remaining\nrepeaters that perform only BSMs are called the “BSM re-\npeaters”. The processor relays this strategy to all repeaters. It\nincludes the operations at every repeater and their sequence\nuntil Alice and Bob are delivered entangled states.\nWe assume that it takes time τpto send the snapshot to\nthe processor and receive the scheduling strategy at all the\nrepeaters. Assuming that the processor is located halfway\nbetween Alice and Bob, we have τp=(2N+1)L\n2(N+1)cf.\nFor two sets of nlinks on opposite sides of a BSM repeater,\nthe link-level BSMs at the repeater and the distillation at\nthe neighboring repeaters do not commute. As a result, the\ndistillation is performed after the BSMs at the BSM repeaters.\n\ners do not commute. As a result, the\ndistillation is performed after the BSMs at the BSM repeaters.\nWe assume that the BSM is deterministic but takes time τBSM.\nThe BSM repeaters perform BSMs on the maximum number\nof possible links simultaneously.\nThe distillation repeaters perform distillation using an\nJn, k, d KQECC as discussed in Section III-A. Let τDecbe the\nruntime of the classical decoder during distillation. We con-\nsider the decoding runtime of MWPM to be around 1ms(see\nqecsim implementation [22]). In comparison, the runtime of\nan FPGA implementation of the Viterbi decoder is around 1µs\nfor a rate- 1/3convolutional code [26]. However, for the toric\ncodes ( n= 18 andn= 50 ), we consider efficient look-up\ntables that achieve a runtime lower than 50ns[23].\nOnce the distillation is complete, every repeater commu-\nnicates the Pauli corrections from distillation to the central\nprocessor, which then transmits all the corrections to Bob.\nThis classical communication step takes time τDist=L\ncf(to\ncommunicate the distillation outcomes from Alice) and affects\nonly the latency of the protocol. The distillation repeaters\napply BSM on the distilled links to generate end-to-end\nWerner states between Alice and Bob. Links with the highest\nfidelity are paired together to perform BSM and maximize\ndistillable entanglement. All repeaters send the BSM outcomes\nto Bob. The upper limit for the time required to send the\nBSM outcomes is the time it takes to send them from the\nrepeater farthest from Bob, so τCC=NL/((N+ 1)cf).\nBob applies Pauli corrections to his qubits based on the\ndistillation and BSM outcomes. We define entanglement rate\nas the sum of the distillable entanglement of all end-to-end\nWerner states ( Dtotal) per optical mode per time step τ, i.e.,\nDtotal/(2Mτ). We assume that link qubits are encoded in the\ndual-rail photonic basis, resulting in two optical modes per\nqubit.\nAfter the protocol starts, assuming τBSM\u003C τDist\u003C(τBSM+\nτCC), Bob finishes applying Pauli correcti\nt.\nAfter the protocol starts, assuming τBSM\u003C τDist\u003C(τBSM+\nτCC), Bob finishes applying Pauli corrections on the first end-\nto-end state at time τlat=τl+τp+ 2τBSM+τDec+τCC,\nthe initial classical communication latency of the protocol as\nshown in Fig. 3. τDistdoes not affect the latency as the pauliFig. 2. Schematic of the protocol with M= 6 ,n= 3 , and k= 1 .\nThe central processor is shown as a circle halfway between Alice and Bob.\n(a) Snapshop of the network. Links (black lines) are generated between the\nneighboring repeaters’ quantum memories (black circles). The vertical black\nlines are intermediate nodes used to generate links.

Scheduling strategy\nThe processor uses a brute-force method to decide the se-\nquence of BSMs and distillations at the repeaters. This method\nsearches over all possible BSM and distillation sequences. We\nfirst calculate C(N+ 1) , the set of all possible compositions\nof the integer (N+ 1). A composition is an ordered partition\nof an integer. For example, all possible compositions of 3\nare(1,1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(3). Composition decides the hop\ndistance between repeaters that perform distillation.\nFor a composition c= (n1, n2, . . . , n i)inC(N+ 1) ,\nthe distillation is performed between Alice and the n1-th\nrepeater, the n1-th and (n1+n2)-th repeater, and so on; the\nremaining repeaters are BSM. The central processor calculates\nthe end-to-end distillable entanglement for the composition\nc= (n1, n2, . . . , n i)∈C(N+ 1) as follows:\n1) The processor first performs BSM on maximum possible\nlinks at the B\n . , n i)∈C(N+ 1) as follows:\n1) The processor first performs BSM on maximum possible\nlinks at the BSM repeaters (refer Fig. 2(b)).\n2) Once the BSMs are complete, the distillation repeaters\nwill have long-range links between them. The fidelities\nof these long-range links are lower than F0. The processor\ndistills the long-range links using the following rules\n(refer Fig. 2(c)):\n•If a distillation repeater has lsuccessful links with its\nneighbor, it divides them into groups of nto distill\nusing an Jn, k, d Kcode. The distillation step converts\nnlinks into klinks with higher fidelity.Nodes Processor\nSnapshot\nscheduling strategy\nDistillation correctionsDistillation corrections\nBSM correctionsBSM correctionsLinks createdτl\nStrategy recievedBSMs startτl+τp\nBSMs completeDistillations startτl+τp+τBSM\nDistillation completeBSMs at distilla-tion repeaters startτl+τp+τBSM +τDec\nBSMs completeEnd-to-end entanglementτl+τp+ 2τBSM +τDec\nReceived by Bobτl+τp+τBSM +τDec +τDist\nReceived by Bobτl+τp+ 2τBSM +τDec +τCC\nFig. 3.

It then decides to distill the links\nonly if it improves the fidelity using Fig. 1.\n3) Once the distillation is complete, at every distillation\nrepeater, the processor pairs up their links (including the\nlinks that are not distilled) in the increasing order of\nfidelity to maximize the distillable entanglement and per-\nforms BSMs. This step creates end-to-end links between\nAlice and Bob (refer Fig. 2(d)).\n4) If the composition cgenerates mend-to-end link with\nfidelities Fc\ni, i∈ {1,2, . . . m }, then the total distillable\nentanglement is Dc\ntotal=Pm\ni=1f(Fc\ni)such that\nf(Fc\ni) =(\nD(Fc\ni)ifFc\ni\u003E0.8107 ,\n0 otherwise.\nHere, D(Fc\ni)is the distillable entanglement calculated\nusing Eq.

Maximizing Dc\ntotal\nmaximizes the number of shared Werner states while\nsimultaneously ensuring that they are of high quality.\nThe steps above are performed on a classical computer\nat the processor. The repeaters perform measurements only\naccording to the optimal composition, after receiving it from\nthe processor.IV. R ESULTS\nA. Rate calculations\nIn this section, we compare the performances of the J3,1,3K\nquantum convolutional code and the J18,2,3Kand J50,2,5K\ntoric codes for our global link-state protocol. We use the\nnotation (n, N)for a protocol that uses Jn, k, d Kdistillation\ncode over a chain of Nrepeaters. Fig. 4(a) compares the three\ncodes when F0= 0.99. The rate monotonically increases with\nthe link success probability p, except for the (50,8)protocol.\nThe distillable entanglement for (50,9)is much higher than\n(50,8)forF0= 0.99and multiplexing M= 450 . Fig. 4(b)\nshows the contributions of the number of end-to-end links\nand their average fidelity to the distillable entanglement when\np= 1.\nThe optimal composition for the (50,8)protocol is\n(1,1, . . . , 1)forp= 1 . This composition distills between\nevery pair of repeaters as F0exceeds the pseudo-threshold\nto generate M×2/50 = 18 distilled links between adjacent\nrepeaters. Consequently, Alice and Bob have 18 shared links.\nOn the other hand, the (10,0)composition is optimal for\nthe(50,9)protocol, when p= 1 . This composition first\napplies BSM at all repeaters to get M= 450 long-range links\n(between Alice and Bob) with fidelity F′\n(10,0). For F0= 0.99,\nF′\n(10,0)falls below the pseudo-threshold of the J50,2,5Kcode;\nAlice and Bob do not distill the shared links. The result is M\nend-to-end links with fidelity F′\n(10,0).(1,1, . . . , 1)is not the\noptimal composition as it generates only 18 links, altho\ndelity F′\n(10,0).(1,1, . . . , 1)is not the\noptimal composition as it generates only 18 links, although of\nhigher fidelity than the (10,0)composition. Our measurement\nstrategy maximizes distillable entanglement, which depends on\nboth the number and fidelity of states. The (10,0)composition\ngenerates more links than (1,1, . . . , 1), compensating for\nlower quality links and resulting in a higher entanglement rate\nthan the (50,8)protocol. Similarly, the (3,8),(3,9),(18,8),\nand(18,9)protocols perform only BSMs and no distillation,\nresulting in identical entanglement rates as the (50,9)protocol.\nThe entanglement rates for (3,9)and(18,9)are lower than\n(3,9)and(18,9)due to an additional BSM.\nNote that, the (9,0)composition for the (50,8)protocol is\nnot optimal. In this case, the fidelity of 450links between Alice\nand Bob after BSMs at all repeaters is higher than pseudo-\nthreshold, resulting in 18 distilled links between Alice and\nBob, identical to the (1,1, . . . , 1)composition. However, the\nfidelity of links is higher when the (1,1, . . . , 1)composition\nis used.\nThe pseudo-threshold of the code, the input fidelity below\nwhich distillation does not improve the fidelity of the out-\nput states, plays a crucial role in determining the number\nand quality of the end-to-end states. The pseudo-threshold\ndecreases with the code rate. Low-rate can distill input states\nwith lower fidelity than high-rate codes. Moreover, a low-rate\ncode consumes more links per distillation. As a result, using a\nlow-rate code for distillation results in fewer but better quality\nend-to-end states than a high-rate code.\nWe use the same reasoning as above to explain a higher\nrate for p= 0.9thanp= 1 for the (50,8)protocol. Theprotocol generates more end-to-end states when p= 0.9, since,\non average, pM links will be generated between repeaters.\nWhen p= 0.9, the links cannot be divided into perfect groups\nof 50. Ungrouped links will undergo only BSM, resulting in\nincreased end-to-end links.\nWhen we lowe\n\nof 50. Ungrouped links will undergo only BSM, resulting in\nincreased end-to-end links.\nWhen we lower F0to0.97, the optimal composition for\n(18,8),(18,9),(50,8),and(50,9)protocols is (1,1, . . . , 1)\n(see Fig. 5). This results in a monotonic increase in the rate\nwithpandFoutdecreases with Nfor(18,8),(18,9),(50,8),\nand(50,9)protocols. F0= 0.97is lower than pseudo-\nthreshold of the J3,1,3Kcode, rendering this code unusable\nfor distillation. In this case, the repeaters use the (N+ 1,0)\ncomposition. For the (N+ 1,0)composition when N= 8 or\nN= 9, the fidelity of links between Alice and Bob after BSMs\nat all repeaters is lower than 0.8107, the threshold for non-zero\ndistillable entanglement (see Eq.(5)), making the entanglement\nrate for the J3,1,3Kcode zero.\nTo summarize, for high p, the optimal compositions is:\n•(1,1, . . . , 1)if the fidelity of links after all BSMs of the\n(N+ 1,0)composition is above the pseudo-threshold.\n•(N+ 1,0)if the fidelity of links after all BSMs in the\n(N+ 1,0)composition is below the pseudo-threshold.\nNo distillation is performed.\n•(N+ 1,0)ifF0is below the pseudo-threshold.\nB. Quantum memory requirements\nIn this section, we calculate the upper bound to the number\nof quantum memories our protocol uses per repeater. The\nmemories used per repeater depend upon the relative values\nof all the network timescales and the error correction code\nrate. We plot the number of quantum memories used as time\nprogresses in Fig. 6 when p= 1. At time t= 0, a repeater\nstarts link generation and utilizes 2Mmemories. Every time\nstepτ, a repeater uses a new set of 2Mmemories to store\nlinks. The number of quantum memories used at time tis\n2M(t/τ+ 1) . The BSM repeater frees 2Mmemories for the\nfirst time by performing BSM at time τl+τp+τBSM (refer\nFig. 3). By this time, it has utilized 2M[(τl+τp+τBSM)/τ+1]\nmemories, assuming (τl+τp+τBSM)is a multiple of τ.\nAfter the BSMs, the number of used memories reduces to\n2M(τl+τp+τBSM)/τ. At time τl+τp+τBSM+τ, another\n2Mmemories \n, the number of used memories reduces to\n2M(τl+τp+τBSM)/τ. At time τl+τp+τBSM+τ, another\n2Mmemories are used, and the links generated at time t= 2τ\nare measured. As a result, the maximum number of memories\na BSM repeater uses is 2M(τl+τp+τBSM)/τ+ 2M.\nA distillation repeater accumulates memories until t=τl+\nτp+τBSM+τDec, resulting in 2M[(τl+τp+τBSM+τDec)/τ+1]\nused memories. Distillation reduces the number of used memo-\nries by 2M(n−k)/n. The number of memories used increases\nuntil the distillation repeater finishes performing BSM on links\ngenerated at t= 0. The number of memories entangled at\nt=τl+τp+ 2τBSM+τDecare2M[(τl+τp+ 2τBSM+\nτDec)/τ+ 1−(1 + τBSM/τ)(n−k)/n]. They reduce to\n2M[(τl+τp+ 2τBSM+τDec)/τ−(τBSM/τ)(n−k)/n]after\nBSM on the kdistilled links.\nNote that, the distillation repeater requires more quantum\nmemories than the BSM repeater due to the classical com-Fig. 4.

IfτDec≪τ, the BSM and\nthe distillation repeaters would require the same number of\nmemories. Similarly, increasing the code rate increases the\nmaximum number of memories used at the distillation repeater.\nV. C ONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nWe have designed a protocol to route Werner states on\na chain of quantum repeaters. It utilizes quantum error-\ncorrecting codes (QECC) for entanglement distillation and\nglobal link-state knowledge to decide the location of distil-\nlation, if any, along the chain for maximum end-to-end distil-\nlable entanglement. We have designed a scheduling strategy\nfor distillation that maximiz\nend distil-\nlable entanglement. We have designed a scheduling strategy\nfor distillation that maximizes the end-to-end distillable en-\ntanglement for every network snapshot. The QECC’s rate and\npseudo-threshold determine the fidelity and number of end-to-\nend states between Alice and Bob. Lower code rates increase\nerror-correction capability and result in higher output fidelity.\nUsing a sufficiently low rate code allows the distribution oflong-range links with higher fidelity than shared links between\nrepeaters at the start of the protocol. However, fewer end-\nto-end states are yielded as more links are consumed per\ndistillation with decreasing code rates. These observations can\nhelp determine the code rate based on the specific applica-\ntion. A higher rate code is chosen for applications requiring\nmany shared entangled states, while applications demanding\nhigh-quality links use a lower rate code. For low-rate code,\nmultiplexing more increases the number of end-to-end links.\nThe code rate also dictates the number of quantum mem-\nories used at the distillation repeaters. In an Jn, k, d KQECC,\nthe fraction of freed quantum memories due to distillation is\n(n−k)/n. A low-rate code frees up more memories than a\nhigh-rate code, reducing memory requirements. The memory\nrequirements grow with the classical computation time of the\ndecoder. Reducing memory usage requires a low-rate code\nwith a fast decoder.\nIn this work, we have assumed perfect quantum memoriesFig. 6. The number of quantum memories used at distillation and BSM\nrepeaters for the J50,2,5Kcode. Here, τp= 20 τ, τl=τ, τBSM =\n4τ, τDec = 10τ.\nwith infinite coherence times, s.t., the fidelity of links held in\nthe memories does not degrade with time. A trivial protocol\nextension would incorporate quantum memories with finite\ncoherence times. In this case, the links would decohere while\nwaiting for classical communication, computation and BSM.\nThe optimal composition for the QECC codes used here is\neither (1,1, . . . , \n, computation and BSM.\nThe optimal composition for the QECC codes used here is\neither (1,1, . . . , 1)or(N+ 1,0), depending upon the number\nof repeaters N, initial fidelity F0, and the rate of the code.\nThe(1,1, . . . , 1)composition is optimal due to the deter-\nministic distillation. We conjecture that if the distillation is\nprobabilistic, i.e., if a penalty is associated with the distillation\nin the cost function to calculate the scheduling strategy, com-\npositions with distillation between non-neighboring repeaters\nwill become optimal. In future work, we aim to study our\nprotocol with probabilistic QECC distillation techniques, such\nas in refs. [15], [17] and derive insights on the scheduling of\ndistillation as a function of network parameters.\nWe have used global link state knowledge to design the\nscheduling strategy. We calculated the optimal compositions\nunder different network parameters. This calculation makes\nit possible to schedule distillation using only local-link state\nknowledge for given network parameters. The local-link state\nprotocol does not require a central processor to calculate the\nscheduling strategy. If a repeater knows their position along\nthe chain, F0, and the QECC used, it can locally decide if it is\na distillation repeater. The local-link state protocol will have\na reduced latency of 2τl+ 2τBSM+τDec+τCC, and require\n2M(τp−τl)/τfewer quantum memories.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.-J. Briegel, W. D ¨ur, J. I. Cirac, and P.

Our architecture\npresents a blueprint for realizing global-scale quantum networks in the near-term.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEntanglement distribution across distant nodes is fun-\ndamental to constructing quantum networks [1]. How-\never, despite recent progress via optical \fber links [2{\n4], scaling quantum networks to global reach remains a\nformidable challenge. One approach to increasing the en-\ntanglement rate over low e\u000Eciency ( \u0011\u001C1) elementary\nlinks is to use a deterministic Bell-state source at Char-\nlie (C) midway between quantum repeaters (QRs) Alice\n(A) and Bob (B) in lieu of an entanglement swap, i.e.\nthe midpoint source architecture. If A (B) post-selects\non events where a photon passed at least path length AC\n(BC), in the regime where the QRs are memory-limited,\nthe average entanglement rate \u0016\u0000 improves to/p\u0011com-\npared to/\u0011in typical protocols where C performs lo-\ncal Bell state measurements (BSM) [5]. Despite the in-\ncrease in QR complexity, this \\midpoint source\" scheme\nenables an increase in \u0016\u0000 byO(1=p\u0011) and has motivated\nresearch e\u000Borts to produce the required entangled pho-\nton pair sources, which should be near-deterministic for\nthe advantage to persist. Thus far, leading e\u000Borts are\nbased on cascaded atomic sources [6, 7] or spontaneous\nparametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. While the\nlatter has demonstrated heralded production of Bell pairs\nout of a single [8{11] or a pair of SPDC sources [12, 13],\nthe existing approaches still su\u000Ber in either e\u000Eciency or\n\u0003englund@mit.edu\fdelity required for near-term quantum networks.\nIn this Article, we propose a quasi-deterministic Bell\npair source (BPS) that eliminates compounding switch-\ning loss of previously proposed spatially multiplexed [13]\nor purely temporally multiplexed [12] heralded BPS.\nNamely, this \\zero-added-loss multiplexing\" (ZALM)\nBPS leverages the large SPDC phase-matching band-\nwidth to achieve high transmission rate via spectral mul-\ntiplexing.\nA high bandwidth BPS is \n band-\nwidth to achieve high transmission rate via spectral mul-\ntiplexing.\nA high bandwidth BPS is crucial to general long-\ndistance entanglement distribution to compensate for\nchannel losses. In this proposal, we consider one speci\fc\napplication of utilizing space-to-ground optical links to\nestablish ground-to-ground entanglement, though such a\nquasi-deterministic BPS would bene\ft any general quan-\ntum network setting. Reaching the global scale, how-\never, calls for space-based con\fgurations, one example\nof which is shown in Fig. 1, where the midpoint source\nis a satellite sending entangled photons to two distant\nground stations. This satellite-mediated entanglement\ndistribution scheme has to contend with extreme chan-\nnel conditions. Here we consider three primary factors\nthat contribute to our particular setup: large transmis-\nsion loss, channel instability, and heralding latency.\nTwo canonical choices for satellite-based optical trans-\nmission links are the downlink anduplink con\fgurations.\nDespite the relative ease of just having an interferometric\nsystem for BSM in space, the uplink su\u000Bers from point-\ning instability due to the \\shower-curtain e\u000Bect\" [14], re-\nquiring two-way adaptive optics yet to be demonstrated,\nmaking the downlink con\fguration more e\u000Ecient [15].arXiv:2206.03670v3  [quant-ph]  13 Apr 20232\nFIG. 1. Protocol overview | A global-scale quantum network composed of \rying satellites as the quantum transmitters (qTX)\nand terrestrial stations as the quantum receivers (qRX). The qTX (C) emits heralded photonic Bell pairs jS(+)\njiABto A and\nB, followed by subsequent spectral mode conversion. Filled (open) circles represent successfully heralded (lost) Bell pairs. The\ntwo bunched photons signify multi-photon emission due to BPS's imperfection. jS(+)\njiABis accompanied by a classical signal\njA;Bcontaining frequency information.

The qTX containing quasi-deterministic heralded BPS can also be implemented in ground-only quantum networks, as\nshown by node Dconnected to other network stations, separated by ground distance LGG(considered in Appendix H).\nTherefore, we limit our investigation to a two-photon\ndownlink architecture.\nA single-rail (heralding on one photon) [2, 16] encoded\nprotocol could increase \u0016\u0000/\u0011over a dual-rail (heralding\non two detected photons) [17] scheme with \u0016\u0000/\u00112. How-\never, it is presently unclear whether the optical carrier-\nlevel phase tracking required in the single-photon scheme\nis compatible with space-to-ground links.\nSpeci\fcally, we assume: (1) the availability of memory-\nmultiplexed ( k-qubits) QRs on the ground { but not\non the satellite; (2) satellite-to-ground (SG) downlinks;\n(3) SG transmission in the telecommunications C-band\nvia frequency conversion for compatibility with space-\nquali\fed photonics [18]; and (4) two-photon-heralding [2,\n16].\nThis Article is organized as follows. Section II presents\nan overview of the satellite-assisted entanglement distri-\nbution architecture, one speci\fc example of global-scale\nquantum network utilizing the ZALM BPS. Section III\ndiscusses the quantum state description of a heralded en-\ntangled state and evaluates the boosted BPS emission\nrate with spectral multiplexing. Section IV then de-\nscribes the two critical components in the ground-based\nquantum receiver: (1) a mode converter for temporal-\nspectral conversion via a sum-frequency generation pro-\ncess; (2) a cavity-based spin-photon interface based on\na hybrid photonic integrated circuit. We then evalu-\nate the ground-to-ground spin-spin entanglement state\n\fdelity and e\u000Eciency in Sections V-VI, accounting forimperfections in the ZALM BPS and the ground-based\nquantum receivers. Additionally, we discuss the trade-o\u000B\nbetween entanglement \fdelity and generation rate due\nto unheralded photon loss in the channe\nrade-o\u000B\nbetween entanglement \fdelity and generation rate due\nto unheralded photon loss in the channels. Finally, Sec-\ntion VII concludes the paper and o\u000Bers thoughts on alter-\nnative approaches for implementing the spectrally multi-\nplexed BPS. Importantly, it addresses engineering chal-\nlenges that still need to be overcome in order to realize\nthe proposed architecture.\nII. ENTANGLEMENT DISTRIBUTION\nARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\nImproving e\u000Eciency and \fdelity of quantum links for\nscalable quantum networks beyond recent satellite-based\ndemonstrations [19, 20] likely requires heralded entangle-\nment of quantum memories. Here, we propose an archi-\ntecture integrating the merits of satellite-based channels\nand spin-photon interfaces containing diamond color cen-\nters. On the satellite, C as a multiplexed quantum trans-\nmitter (qTX) emits heralded polarization-encoded pho-\ntonic Bell statesjS(+)\njiAB= (jHAVBi+jVAHBi)=p\n2 =\n(j1;0; 0;1i+j0;1; 1;0i)=p\n2 (polarization-Fock represen-\ntation [13]), accompanied by a classical heralding mes-\nsage encoding its frequency information, jA;B. Idler pho-\ntons (of same polarization unknown to us) of a pair of\npulse-pumped SPDC sources are interfered and detected\ninwavelength demultiplexed channels to herald Bell pairs3\nin the signal photons. The detail will be covered in Sec-\ntion IV.\nEach photon of the Bell pair described by jS(+)\njiAB\nthen travels to its respective terrestrial quantum receiver\n(qRX), A and B (detailed in Section IV). At each re-\nceiver, a mode-converter (MC) [21, 22] converts both the\nfrequency and the spectral bandwidth of the photon to\nmatch those of the quantum memories, crucial for e\u000E-\ncient cavity-based spin-photon interaction [23]. Finally,\nsuccessful photon detection at both A and B completes\nteleportation, i.e. A and B sharing spin-spin entangle-\nment upon heralding on the same Bell state's photons.\nThe analysis and discussion of our proposal in the rest\nof manuscript is tailored towards studying the perfor-\nmance a\niscussion of our proposal in the rest\nof manuscript is tailored towards studying the perfor-\nmance and challenges of a single quantum link; how-\never the utility of a ZALM link is applicable to terres-\ntrial \fber-based quantum links. Multi-hop linear chain\nof quantum repeaters (where the channel between A and\nB is subdivided into smaller segments) with ZALM ar-\nchitecture based links for generation of entanglement and\nlocal entanglement swapping between memories (in a re-\npeater station) is a natural extension of our study, as\nis a regular grid network (on a well de\fned `lattice') of\nrepeaters which can support multiple entanglement gen-\neration paths. We reserve the analysis of these advanced\nnetwork geometries for future work.\nIII. QUANTUM TRANSMITTER\nA. Photonic sources of high-quality dual-rail\nentangled qubits\nGeneration of high-quality photonic entangled pairs is\nan open research challenge, with multiple possible ap-\nproaches, each having their own set of merits and demer-\nits. We consider SPDC sources pumped with a mode-\nlocked laser, combining previous proposals for quasi-\ndeterministic sources [8{13, 24{27]. More speci\fcally,\nour BPS builds on the proposal of Ref. [13] of inter-\nfering photons of a pair of SPDC sources [28{30] to\nherald Bell pair production. Prior proposals necessi-\ntate spatial multiplexing to boost the Bell pair gener-\nation rate. However, this requires optical switches in a\ntree-con\fguration whose number of layers grows expo-\nnentially with the number of spatial multiplexing modes.\nGiven \fnite loss per switch, the compounded optical lossthrough the switch array quickly renders the Bell pair\ngeneration ine\u000Ecient. For example, the multiplexing re-\nquirements are very demanding ( \u0018107sources running\nin parallel) to achieve quasi-deterministic state genera-\ntion. Considering 0.5 dB loss per switch, \u0018107would\nlead to 10\u00000:5=10\u0001log2(107)\u00187% e\u000Eciency.\nIn our current proposal, we leverage the large phase-\nmatching bandwidth \u001Bpm= 10 THz for spect\nency.\nIn our current proposal, we leverage the large phase-\nmatching bandwidth \u001Bpm= 10 THz for spectral mul-\ntiplexing. After the beam splitter interaction of the\nintermediate BSM, we demultiplex the output beams\ninto dense wavelength division multiplexing channels\n(DWDM) and perform single photon detection on each\nchannel separately (Bell state analyzer shown in Fig. 2).\nEach DWDM channel is spaced apart by \u001Bch= 12:5 GHz\nover\u001Bpmin the C-band. If detection (with the correct\nclick patterns; see Appendix A) occurs in the same fre-\nquency channels for the two DWDMs, then the BPS has\nheralded production of a photonic Bell state.\nFirst, we consider the quantum state of a single down-\nconversion process in a \u001F(2)medium [25, 31, 32],\nj i=c0j0i+c1Z\nJ(!S;!I)^ay\nS(!S)^ay\nI(!I)j0i\n+c2Z\nJ(!S;!I)^ay\nS(!S)^ay\nS(!I)\n\u0001J(!0\nS;!0\nI)^ay\nS(!0\nS)^ay\nI(!0\nI)j0i (1)\nup to two-photon contributions, where j0iis signal-idler\nmode in the vacuum state, and ^ ay(!k) is the creation\noperator at frequency !kfor the signal ( k=S) or idler\n(I):.J(!S;!I) represents the joint spectral amplitude\nfunction (Appendix A).\nThe constituent terms of Eq.(1) are the vacuum\n(j0;0i), single photon entanglement (with J(!S;!I) and\nterms with a second order contribution. The latter\nare detrimental to entanglement distribution protocols\nas they lie outside the dual-rail photonic qubit Hilbert\nspace. With photon loss, these terms yield false click\npatterns and limit the \fdelity of the distributed entan-\ngled pairs [13, 33]. Each SPDC source in Fig. 2 comprises\ntwo down-conversion processes [34]. The qTX performs\nBSM in each DWDM channel by interfering the idler pho-\ntons from both SPDC sources. We take J(!S;!I) to ex-\nhibit frequency anti-correlation between signal-idler pho-\ntons, such that a demultiplexed detection heralds `which-\nfrequency' information about the Bell pair. Based on\nthe analysis of Ref. [13] and its extension to the current\nproposal (see Appendix A for a detailed derivation), the\nspectrally-synchro\nextension to the current\nproposal (see Appendix A for a detailed derivation), the\nspectrally-synchronized BSM that yields one of the de-\nsirable photon click patterns (say on channel j) heralds\nan entangled state with a spectral description given as,\njS(\u0006)\nji/Z\n~\njd\u0016!\"\u0012\nJ(!A1;!A0\n1)J(!B0\n2;!B2) ^ay\nA1(!A1) ^ay\nB2(!B2) + (\u00001)m1J(!A2;!A0\n2)J(!B0\n1;!B1) ^ay\nA2(!A2) ^ay\nB1(!B1)\u0013\n+ (\u00001)m2\u0012\nJ(!A1;!A0\n1)J(!A2;!A0\n2) ^ay\nA1(!A1) ^ay\nA2(!A2) + (\u00001)m1J(!B0\n2;!B2)J(!B0\n1;!B1) ^ay\nB1(!B1) ^ay\nB2(!B2)\u0013#\n\u0002j0iA1j0iA2j0iB1j0iB2: (2)4\nquantum transmitter (qTX)B|α0eiωt〉ωSωSωIspectral demuxed Bell state analyzer\t\t\t\ndemuxdemux\nheralding signal on Channel j\n𝑀\n𝜔!|𝛼!𝑒\"#!$⟩𝜒(&)𝜒(&)𝜔!\n𝜔(𝜔)𝜔(𝜔)𝑗𝑗*𝑗+𝑆,-*+\nFIG. 2.

The horizontal black solid line indicates\nthe \fxed \fdelityF= 0:998, which is chosen based on partic-\nular parameter values considered (see main text). Both the\nblue and orange dashed lines indicate their intersections at\nthe respective Nsvalues for the heralded and non-heralded\nBPS.\nSPDC, which we assume to be \u001Bpm= 10 THz. To\ncompute the BPS emission rate requires knowing the\ndensity matrix of the heralded BPS' output state \u001ABPS,\nwhich depends on the mean photon number per mode\nNsthat is e\u000Bectively dictated by the power of the pump\n\feld. Given \u001ABPSand accounting for imperfections in the\nquantum receiver, we can evaluate the resultant spin-\nspin entangled state and its \fdelity to the ideal Bell\nstate,F, after heralded teleportation of the photonic\nqubits. More details on calculations of Fwill be cov-\nered in Section IV. Figure 3 shows Fas a function of Ns\nfor both the heralded BPS and the non-heralded free-\nrunning narrowband SPDC source. For the former, as\nNsincreases, the e\u000Bect of loss is suppressed and hence\nthe \fdelity increases. For the latter, however, \fdelity in-\ncreases from having higher Bell pair contribution relative\nto \n For the latter, however, \fdelity in-\ncreases from having higher Bell pair contribution relative\nto the other order terms. After reaching an optimum,\nthe \fdelity begins to drop with increasing Nsas a re-\nsult of multi-photon events degrading the photonic Bell\nstate \fdelity. Note that in general the generation rate\ncan be improved by increasing Ns, at the cost of low-\nering the heralded photonic Bell state \fdelity (thereby\nthe spin-spin Bell state \fdelity). For an instance, for the\nZALM BPS, increasing Nsto 8\u000210\u00002still maintains\na \fdelityF \u0015 0:995. On the other hand, with a free-\nrunning SPDC, the \fdelity drops o\u000B much more quickly\ndue to higher order terms that cannot be eliminated via\nheralding.\nTo fairly compare the performance of the two, we \fx\nthe spin-spin Bell state \fdelity still attainable by the non-\nheralded BPS at F= 0:998 and derive a corresponding\na mean photon number of Ns= 2:94\u000210\u00002for the her-\nalded ZALM BPS. Given Ns, we numerically compute\nthe density matrix of the heralded photonic state in the\nFock basis for each spectral mode, and consequently cal-5\nculate the probability of generating a heralded Bell pair\npgenby taking a partial trace over the Bell basis states.\nWe \fndpgen= 3:6\u000210\u00004per spectral mode. Now,\naccounting for all the spectral modes, we can greatly\nboost the generation probability. Speci\fcally, assuming\na DWDM channel bandwidth of 12.5 GHz, the num-\nber of spectral-multiplexed modes is simply Nmodes =\n\u001Bpm=\r= 10 THz =12.5 GHz= 800. The probability\nof successfully heralding a photonic Bell pair per pulse\nacross the entirety of the phase-matching bandwidth \u001Bpm\nispZALM = 1\u0000(1\u0000pgen)Nmodes = 2:5\u000210\u00001. If we con-\nsider a state of the art mode-locked laser with a pulse\ngeneration repetition rate of \u001Brep= 30 GHz [35], the av-\nerage Bell pair emission rate is pZALM\u0002\u001Brep\u00197:45 GHz.\nIn contrast, for a narrowband-\fltered free-running\nSPDC source (non-heralded BPS), we \fnd the required\nmean photon number mode of Ns;SPDC = 1:27\u000210\u00003,\nto suppress highe\nheralded BPS), we \fnd the required\nmean photon number mode of Ns;SPDC = 1:27\u000210\u00003,\nto suppress higher order terms and match the \fdelity of\nthe heralded spin-spin state ( F= 0:998) with the her-\nalded ZALM BPS. We again compute its density ma-\ntrix and \fnd the probability of generating a Bell pair\nto bepgen,SPDC = 2:5\u000210\u00003. Since we assume a\nnarrowband-\fltered source, the absence of spectral mul-\ntiplexing means the success probability is the genera-\ntion probability itself, i.e. pgen,SPDC =pSPDC . As-\nsuming the same pulsed laser repetition rate of 30 GHz,\nthe average generation rate for the photonic Bell pair is\npSPDC\u0002\u001Brep= 75 MHz.\nC. Requirements on the photon detectors for\nentanglement swap\nHere we consider the requirements on the single photon\ndetectors in qTX. First, the detector reset time should\nbe short enough such that ideally there are no missed\nheralding events. Given Ns, the average production rate\nfor the signal-idler pair would be Ns\u001Brep. The number\nof incident photons per channel within the detector's re-\nset time\u001Crwould be\u0016=\u001CrNs\u001Brep=(4\u0002Nmodes ), where\nthe factor of 4 stems from the need of four detectors for\nBSM [13]. Consequently, the probability of detecting \u00152\nphotons in one channel within the detector's reset time is\np= 1\u0000exp(\u0000\u0016)\u0000\u0016exp(\u0000\u0016) following the Poisson dis-\ntribution.\nWe take a detector reset time \u001Cr= 1 ns [36, 37], re-\nsulting in\u0016= 1 ns\u00027:45 MHz=(4\u0002800) = 2:3\u000210\u00003.\nThe probability of detecting \u00152 photons is then \u0018\n2:7\u000210\u00006\u001C1, which is su\u000Eciently small to neglect\nmissed detection events due to multiple-photon incidence\non the same detector within its reset time.\nSecond, the detector jitter must be su\u000Eciently small\nto avoid projecting the output of the ZALM BPS to a\nmixed state. Otherwise, this would lead to sub-optimal\nBSM due to spectral distinguishability and an overall re-\nduction in the mode conversion e\u000Eciency at the ground\nstations.

QUANTUM RECEIVER\nA. Mode conversion for frequency and bandwidth\nmatching\nFor e\u000Ecient cavity-based spin-photon interaction, the\nphoton must be 1) resonant with the spin's optical tran-\nsition and, 2) narrow in bandwidth relative to the emit-\nter's optical linewidth [23]. Hence, we consider a \\mode-\nconverter\" (MC) that frequency up-converts from tele-\ncom C-band to visible wavelengths and pulse shapes to\nreduce the photon's spectral bandwidth, i.e. increasing\nthe initial temporal width of the photon \u0001 tito a \fnal\ntemporal width \u0001 tf\u001D\u0001ti.6\nAs shown in Fig. 4, upon arrival \nmporal width of the photon \u0001 tito a \fnal\ntemporal width \u0001 tf\u001D\u0001ti.6\nAs shown in Fig. 4, upon arrival from the satellite, the\nphoton with carrier frequency !aenters a high-Q ring\ncavity [39] made from a \u001F(2)-material, supporting three\nresonance frequencies: !a;!b(target frequency matching\nthe emitter's transition at 737 nm, see Section IV B) and\n!c(strong pump's frequency) that satisfy energy conser-\nvation:!a+!c=!b[40]. Upon receiving the classical\nmessagejA;BencodingjS(+)\njiAB's frequency information,\nthe pump \feld is optimally shaped to convert photons in\nmodeato modeb[21, 22]. Since each DWDM channel\ncorresponds to a unique frequency, each ground receiver\ncontains an array of ring resonators whose resonance fre-\nquencies are spaced 12.5 GHz apart. To reduce the in-\ntensive requirement of having many ring resonators, each\nresonator may include phase shifters to address multi-\nple DWDM channel frequencies. For example, if each\nresonator has up to 1 THz of tuning range [41{44], cor-\nresponding to 80 DWDM channels, the number of ring\nresonators needed reduces from Nmodes = 800 to 10.\nA subtle feature of the MC is that it acts as an ad-\nditional spectral \flter , which removes spurious spectral\nmodes from interacting with the spin memories in the\nqRX. For example, second-order terms with two photon-\npairs per SPDC source as indicated in Eq. (1) may lead to\ninterference between spectrally degenerate photons (for\ne.g. single idler photons at !Ifrom the constituent SPDC\nsources) with an accompanying non-degenerate photon\n(i.e. one of idler modes actually generates a two-pair term\nwith!I6=!0\nI); henceforth we shall term these as \\leak-\nage photons\". With perfect detection e\u000Eciency, these\nevents would be immediately \ragged based on the detec-\ntion pattern (since the pattern would deviate from the\nideal spectral mode-synchronized detection). However, in\nthe practical case of non-unity detection e\u000Eciency, these\nevents may not be discernible from a scenario in which\nonly \frst-o\nn-unity detection e\u000Eciency, these\nevents may not be discernible from a scenario in which\nonly \frst-order photon-pairs from the two SPDC sources\ninterfere (i.e. idler photon at !0\nIis lost). Given a particu-\nlar BSM with the correct click pattern, the qTX sends the\nknown information jA;Babout the heralded Bell pair's\nfrequency. Regardless of the presence of leakage photons,\nsay at!0\nS, the MC would only up-convert !Sphotons\nspeci\fed by jA;B. In this sense, the \fnal spin-spin Bell\nstate is partially post-selected spectrally. We note that\nthe edge case of having second-order terms with spec-\ntrally degenerate idler photons (and therefore signal by\nfrequency correlation) is indeed a non-correctable error,\nbut is accounted for in the \fdelity calculations presented\nin Section V later.\nWe use the method developed in Ref. [21] to realize\na beam splitter Hamiltonian (in the frequency domain)\nbetween modes aandbvia sum-frequency-generation\n(SFG) between the pump and mode a, though other pro-\nposed methods are equally viable [45{49].

Spin-photon interface for quantum memory\nstorage\nIllustrated in Fig. 4, after passing through the MC,\nthe photons at A and B each arrive at a bank of spin\nmemories, which we take to be SiV\u0000centers in diamond\ncoupled to nanocavities as described in Ref. [50] for mem-\nory multiplexi\n be SiV\u0000centers in diamond\ncoupled to nanocavities as described in Ref. [50] for mem-\nory multiplexing. Each SiV\u0000's electron spin can map\nonto a neighboring nuclear spin for long memory storage\nvia hyper\fne interaction [51] (Appendix E), minimizing\ndecoherence while the repeater waits for subsequent pho-\ntons. For calculating the spin-spin Bell state \fdelity, we\nassume a su\u000Eciently long nuclear spin coherence time\n\u001D1 s and neglect dephasing errors.\nThe spin memories can be optically interfaced through\na 1\u0002Nswitching array that directly routes from 1 input\nchannel to Noutput channels. For an example, beam-\nsteering devices such as a spatial light modulator may\nbe used to route incoming photons to an arbitrary cav-\nity in a free-space con\fguration. For the calculations\ncovered in the remainder of the Article, we assumed us-\ning a su\u000Eciently fast optical switch array with speed\n\u0018p\u0011pZALM\u001Brep\u0019100 kHz. In Appendix D, however, we\nalso consider spin memories heterogeneously integrated\ninto a LiNbO 3-based [39, 52] PIC for high-bandwidth\noperations. For the latter, the entanglement genera-\ntion rate decreases with increasing memory multiplex-\ning due to a log2Ndepth Mach-Zehnder interferome-\nter. One strategu to minimize the required dimension of\nthe switching array is to assume the presence of multi-\nple memories inside each cavity. Since the memories (at\na given site) would be pre-characterized, their emission\nfrequencies are known beforehand. The MC can then be\nused to spectrally select an emitter via upconversion.\nImportantly, prior to the switching array, the modes\nof polarization-encoded photonic state are split into two\nphysical paths (on the PIC) by a polarization beam split-\nter. Only polarization mode jHienters the 1\u0002Nopti-cal interposer to an array of knanocavities. The pho-\nton then re\rects o\u000B the cavity and acquires a spin-state-\ndependent phase [23]. Mode jVi, on the other hand,\nacquires a constant phase by re\recting o\u000B a mirror in a\npath length-matched to that\n the other hand,\nacquires a constant phase by re\recting o\u000B a mirror in a\npath length-matched to that traveled by the jHicom-\nponent. Together, the polarization-encoded qubit un-\ndergoes a controlled-phase gate that e\u000Bectively entan-\ngles the photonic qubit with the spin memory. After\nthe two polarization modes re-interfere at a beam split-\nter, they are subsequently detected in the diagonal basis\nto herald quantum teleportation, i.e. mapping a pho-\ntonic qubitj iP=\u000BjHi+\fjVionto the spin qubit\nj iS=\u000Bj#i+\fj\"i.\nCrucially, the controlled-phase gate \fdelity depends on\nthe atom-cavity cooperativity, C. In the limit of high\ncooperativity, the cavity re\rection coe\u000Ecient (for the H-\npolarization mode) would be\nrC\u001D1\u0000\u0000\u0000!C\u00001\nC+ 1(9)\nMore details on the derivation can be found in Ap-\npendix E. For the entanglement \fdelity calculations\npresented in Section V, we assume a cooperativity of\nC= 100 [3]. Therefore, the mode-converted photon's\nbandwidth of 200 MHz is still much narrower than the\nspin's Purcell-broadened linewidth, a requirement which\nis paramount to the cavity re\rection protocol [23, 53].\nV. ENTANGLEMENT FIDELITY\nWe now analyze the spin-spin Bell state \fdelity by ac-\ncounting for imperfections in the qTX and qRX. First, for\neach spectral mode (i.e. spanning a single DWDM chan-\nnel bandwidth), we compute the density matrix of the\nheralded photonic state \u001AZALM based on Eq. 2. \u001AZALM ,\nin the polarization-Fock basis fjHA;VA;HB;VBig, con-\ntains up to two-photon contributions for AandB. As for\nthe spin qubits each initialized in a superposition state\nj iS;i=j#i+j\"i)=p\n2, they form a product state\n\u001AS;i=\u0010\nj ih jS;i\u0011\n2\n(10)\nHence, the collective initial state for both photonic and\nspin qubits is \u001Ai=\u001AZALM\n\u001AS;i.\nBy considering \fnite cooperativity and waveguide-\ncavity coupling strengths based on the parameters used\nin Ref. [50], we evaluate the resultant controlled-phase\ngate operation acting only on the Bell basis states, ^UCZ.\nFor non-vacuum basis states outside of the Bell ba-\ntion acting only on the Bell basis states, ^UCZ.\nFor non-vacuum basis states outside of the Bell ba-\nsis, we treat these contributions as erroneous photonic\nstates that project the spins into maximally mixed states.\nAssuming perfect single-qubit gate for the Hadamard\nand Pauli-correction operations post-heralding, the tele-\nported state's \fdelity Fteleshared between the two spin\nmemories at A and B is calculated by taking the overlap\nwith an ideal spin-spin Bell state j\b+i(considering here8\nonly one of the four Bell states):\nFtele=wBell\u0001h\b+jbUCZ\u001AibUy\nCZj\b+i+wnot\u0000Bell\n4(11)\nwherewBellandwnot\u0000Bellrepresent the partial traces\nover the Bell and non-Bell basis states. The latter term is\nagain due to terms outside of the Bell basis projecting the\nspin memories into maximally mixed states. Accounting\nfor dark counts (later calculations assume 102Hz based\non Ref. [20]), we further modify the teleported state's\n\fdelity to be,\nFtele!\u0010\nwBell\u0001h\b+jbUCZ\u001AibUy\nCZj\b+i+wnot\u0000Bell\n4\u0011\n\u0002(1\u0000pdark)2+2(1\u0000pdark)pdark+p2\ndark\n4:(12)\nNext, we focus on in\fdelity caused by photon loss in\nthe channel . The issue arises from a competition between\ne\u000Eciency and \fdelity. Since initializing spins is time-\nconsuming [3], time can be saved by not re-initializing\nthe spins after every attempt (where photons transmit\nthrough atmosphere and arrived at qRX). A complica-\ntion arises if a photon is lost after re\recting o\u000B the cav-\nity. This qubit loss error projects the spin into a maxi-\nmally mixed state; however since the loss is unheralded,\nthe spins may not be re-initialized for the subsequent\ninteracting photons. As a result, the average spin-spin\nBell state \fdelity decreases as the number of attempt\nincreases. By setting a maximum number of attempts\nNmaxbefore needing to re-initialize the spins, we can\nthen minimize this photon loss in\fdelity, \u000F.\nTo calculate the dependence of \u000FonNmax, we consider\nthree scenarios when a photon arrives at the qRX. It can\nbe (1) detected with probabilityp\u0011(assume identica\ncenarios when a photon arrives at the qRX. It can\nbe (1) detected with probabilityp\u0011(assume identical\ndownlink channels), (2) lost before reaching the spin with\nprobability plost, or (3) lost after reaching the spin with\nprobability pe. Since generally plost\u001Dfp\u0011;peg, we save\ntime by not re-initializing the spins after every channel\nuse.\nHowever, as mentioned previously, skipping spin re-\ninitialization after detector click potentially causes an\nunheralded error. Thus, we optimize the spin-spin en-\ntanglement \fdelity by constraining the number of loading\nattempts before we re-initialize the spins. For simplicity\nof analysis, we \fx an average qTX transmission rate at\n1=\u001C0=pZALM\u001Brep\u00197:45 GHz (Section III B). The prob-\nability of at least one unheralded error occurring in the\n\frstm\u00001 time bins conditioned on detector clicks on\nthemth bin is\nPerror(m;m ) = 1\u0000(\u0018plost=(1\u0000p\u0011))2(m\u00001); (13)\nwhere\u0018is the probability of both A and B receiving\nphotons, computed from taking a partial trace of \u001AZALM\nover basis states with \u00151 photons going to A and B.Then, the probability of error over Nbins is\nPerror=NX\nm=1Perror(m;m )(1\u0000\u0011)m\u00001\u0011: (14)\nFinally, the average state \fdelity is\nF= (1\u0000Perror)Ftele+Perror\n4: (15)\nThe maximum \fdelity Fmaxoccurs when Perror= 0. We\ncan then de\fne \u000F=Fmax\u0000F as the average in\fdelity\narising from the unheralded photon loss error. Constrain-\ning\u000Ftherefore limits the maximum number of bins Nmax\nbefore needing to re-initialize the spin memories.\nVI. AVERAGE ENTANGLEMENT\nGENERATION RATE\nLastly, we compute entanglement generation rate \u0016\u0000 by\nconsidering kspins in the qRX. For simplicity, we let only\na single initialized spin to accept photons at a time. Upon\nsuccessful spin-photon mapping, A communicates with B\nto determine if B's corresponding photon was successfully\ndetected. If both photons were detected, A then transfers\nthe electron spin to the nuclear spin for memory storage\n(see Appendix E). Otherwise, A re-initializes the spin\nqubit and awaits subsequent succes\nry storage\n(see Appendix E). Otherwise, A re-initializes the spin\nqubit and awaits subsequent successful detection(s). This\ncommunicate-and-reset sequence takes a time \u001Cidle, given\nby the sum of communication time \u001Ccomm and the spin\nreset time\u001Creset.\nSince the remaining ( k\u00001) spins are inactive, each spin\nis \\on-duty\" for time \u001Cidle=(k\u00001). The qTX generates\nNk\u0011\u001Cidle=[(k\u00001)\u001C0] attempts during a single spin's on-\nduty time. Furthermore, the target \fdelity F=Fmax\u0000\n\u000F(Nmax) limitsNmax, as mentioned in Section V.

The spin re-initialization time is\nassumed to be \u001Creset= 30\u0016s [3].\nForAB= 104km (blue, orange, and yellow curves in\nFig. 6(b)), at low k, ZALM and SPDC have comparable\n\u0016\u0000 since the rate is limited by a quickly saturated bank of\nmemories, i.e. photons are arriving at a rate faster than\nthe spins are able to be freed up. However, as kincreases,\nthe advantage of the ZALM BPS starts manifesting as its\nrate performance surpasses that of a non-heralded SPDC\nsource.\nThe point of divergence between the ZALM BPS and\nSPDC depends on \u000Fand\u001Ccomm .

To maintain a small\n\u000F= 10\u00003, A and B need to re-initialize the spins more\nfrequently , i.e. reducing Nmaxregardless of k. Hence,\nZALM and SPDC achieve similar \u0016\u0000. Instead, if \u001Ccomm is\nreduced, e.g. smaller AB= 102km, the e\u000Bect of mem-\nory saturation is suppressed. As a result, ZALM would\ngreatly outperform SPDC even with small k, shown by\nthe purple curves in Fig. 6(b).

Similar calculations for a ground-only\nquantum repeater network are presented in Appendix H,\nwhere we consider a midpoint source equidistant from\nA and B separated by 2 LGG= 102km. Expectedly, a\nqTX based on the ZALM BPS shows a rate advantage\nby more than an order of magnitude than one based on10\na non-heralded SPDC source.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, we further compute the entangle-\nment generation rate \u0016\u0000 and the probability of success\npZALM as a function of the number of spectrally mul-\ntiplexed modes Nmodes fork=f104;105;106g.

As kincreases to 106, the rate\nat which spin memories is freed up at the qRX becomes\ncomparable to 1 =\u001C0, giving rise to an increase in \u0016\u0000 mono-\ntonic with Nmodes .

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\nIn this Article, we proposed a midpoint source archi-\ntecture relying on\nVII. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\nIn this Article, we proposed a midpoint source archi-\ntecture relying on a quasi-deterministic `zero-added-loss\nmultiplexed' BPS for quantum networks. It leverages\nthe large phase-matching bandwidth intrinsic to SPDC\nsources and utilizes spectral multiplexing via commer-\ncially available DWDMs. Moreover, our proposed mode\nconverter crucially upconverts the heralded photons to\nspectral modes with matching frequency and bandwidth\nto those of solid-state spin qubits, a step which is essential\nfor memory-based repeater networks. Our calculations\nshow that the ZALM BPS greatly increases the entan-\nglement generation rate \u0016\u0000, especially in low-transmission,\nmemory-limited links. In our scheme, upon receiving her-\nalded photonic Bell pairs from the quantum transmitter\non the satellite, the ground-based quantum receivers per-\nform photon-to-spin mapping and herald spin-spin en-\ntanglement between two remote terrestrial stations. Our\ncalculations show that in the memory-limited regime, our\n\\midpoint source\" scheme has a favorablep\u0011rate scal-\ning. As memory multiplexing increases to k'102, for\nground-to-ground distance 102km, the ZALM BPS en-\nables \u0016\u0000\u003E10 Hz with theoretical spin-spin Bell state \f-\ndelityF\u003E0:99. This signi\fcantly outperforms the case\nwhere a single SPDC (non-heralded) source is used, in\nwhich \u0016\u0000 is lower by\u00182 orders of magnitude. We stress\nthat such a high bandwidth BPS should prove valuable to\nany two-way quantum repeater network con\fgurations.\nFor example, the advantage is apparent in a ground-only\nquantum network as shown in Appendix H. Addition-\nally, the ZALM BPS may also bene\ft applications that\nmust rely on distribution of optical entanglement, such as\noptical quantum computing [56{58], precision measure-\nment [59], and all-optical quantum repeaters [60, 61].\nCurrently, the upper bound of \u0016\u0000 is limited by the low\nprobability of detecting the same Bell pair, which is a\nfunction of both channel loss \u0011and the BPS emissionrate 1=\n detecting the same Bell pair, which is a\nfunction of both channel loss \u0011and the BPS emissionrate 1=\u001C0. While\u000B(e.g. atmospheric attenuation) is of-\nten a \fxed parameter, \u0011can be further improved by ad-\nditional engineering: reducing the DWDM channel band-\nwidth to increase the number of spectrally multiplexed\nmodes, minimizing loss in optical transmission (for e.g.\nincreasing adaptive optics transmission e\u000Eciency, using\nlarger optical apertures etc.), minimizing insertion loss\nfor the 1\u0002Nswitching array, and increasing the cavity\nre\rection e\u000Eciency (dictated by both design and fabrica-\ntion capability currently [62]). As for boosting the ZALM\nBPS' emission rate, using higher pump powers does in-\ncrease the mean photon numbers Ns(and consequently\nthe heralding probability) at the cost of degraded state \f-\ndelity. Having higher single photon detectioon e\u000Eciency\non the satellite could also improve 1 =\u001C0. We stress that\nfor ZALM's advantage to persist, the detection e\u000Eciency\nmust be high in qTX entanglement swap and heralding.\nMissed photon detection translates to in\fdelity in the\nheralded state, countered only by lowering Ns, which fur-\nther limits the heralding and entanglement distribution\nrate.\nThe implementation of the qTX in the proposal thus\nfar demands having a large number of detectors in the\nmidpoint source. Alternative to DWDM and having de-\ntectors for each spectral channel, one may also use time-\nof-\right measurements via dispersive optical elements al-\nready experimentally demonstrated in Ref. [63]. With a\ndetector reset time \u001Crand a pump whose repetition rate\nof\u001C1=\u001Cr, a single detector would su\u000Ece, therefore sig-\nni\fcantly reducing the detector requirement for the BPS.\nHowever, we note that having a high detection e\u000Eciency\nis critical to correctly heralding Bell state creation in the\nqTX [13]. However, we note that there exists a large at-\ntenuation loss in the dispersive element ( \u001810 dB based\non Ref. [63]). Further technological improvements in con-\nstr\n the dispersive element ( \u001810 dB based\non Ref. [63]). Further technological improvements in con-\nstructing high-e\u000Eciency and highly dispersive optics are\nwarranted to realize a practical qTX based on time-of-\n\right measurements.\nIn the qRX, the mode converter is imperative to en-\nabling\u001C1 ns long photons to interact with spin mem-\nories with\u003Cns temporal width at frequencies 100s THz\naway. As opposed to sum-frequency generation in high-\nQring resonators, time-lensing e\u000Bect already realized\nin electro-optical modulating platforms (e.g. LiNbO 3)\ncould also be viable alternatives [49, 64].\nGiven current demonstration of PIC-integrated k\u0018\n102SiV\u0000[65], the achievable \u0016\u0000 is\u00181 ebit/s. It remains\nanother engineering challenge to realize large-scale inte-\ngration of solid-state spin qubits in photonic structures.\nPotential avenues may include implanting multiple emit-\nters within each cavity via focused-ion beam [65, 66] and\nspectrally select a frequency-unique spin.\nLastly, instead of using a cavity-re\rection spin-photon\nmapping protocol, BSM based on atomic emission inter-\nfering with photonics Bell pairs can also entangle remote\nspins [5]. The spin memories suitable for the proposed\narchitecture extends to other matter qubits such as\ndefects in Si [67] and SiC [68], rare-earth ions [69, 70],11\natomic vapors [71], cold atoms, and trapped ions, may\nbe suitable memory qubits as well. Irrespective of the\nentanglement scheme and platform choice, our proposal\nremains viable as an optical entanglement distribution\nprotocol for midpoint source based quantum links.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Zheshen Zhang (Univ. of Michigan),\nPaul G.

This coe\u000Ecient is\nassumed to be equal over the frequency range of interest.\n{Vis the volume of interacting \feld regions in the nonlinear crystal.\nTo simplify the analysis, the down-converted beams are constrained to be co-linear with the pump beam. The volume\nintegral in Eq. (A1) then becomes an integral over only one direction, which we choose to be z. The positive frequency\npart of the \feld operator ^Ej(z;t), is described by\n^E(+)\nj(z;t) =Z\nd!jA(!j) ^aj(!j)ei[kj(!j)z\u0000!jt]; (A2)\nwhere ^aj(!j) is the photon annihilation operator for the mode de\fned by frequency !j, thezdirection, and the\npolarization associated with the index j. The term A(!j) is a slowly varying function of frequency,\nA(!j) =is\n~!j\n2\u000F0n2(!j)\u0002Vj: (A3)\nThis term varies slowly w.r.t. the \feld frequencies, and hence may be taken outside the integral. In Eq. (A3), n(!j)\nis the frequency dependent refractive index and Vjis the mode volume. In case of a free-space implementation,\nthis is calculated as the product of the crystal face area and the propagation length of the photons generated by\nthe down-conversion process; the crystal face area is replaced by the waveguide mode area are in case of an on-chip\nimplementation. Since SPDC is a very ine\u000Ecient process, the pump \feld must be relatively large. Accordingly,\nthe electric-\feld operator ^E(+)\np(r;t) may be replaced by the classical \feld Ep(r;t) =e\u000B(t)eikP(!P)z. The interaction\nHamiltonian may now be expressed as\n^Hint(t) =AZL\n0dzZ\nd!IZ\nd!S^ay\nI(!I) ^ay\nS(!S)e\u000B(t)\u0002e\u0000if[kI(!I)+kS(!S)\u0000kP(!P)]z\u0000[!I+!S]tg+ H:c:; (A4)\nwhereLis the length of the crystal and A(!j) has been grouped into a single parameter A, along with several\nconstants de\fned by\nA=A(!S)A(!I)\u001F(2)\u0019A(!P=2)2\u001F(2)(\nped into a single parameter A, along with several\nconstants de\fned by\nA=A(!S)A(!I)\u001F(2)\u0019A(!P=2)2\u001F(2)(A5)\nFor a continuous wave (CW) pump, the nonlinear interaction prescribed by Eq. (A4) is a continuous process. We\ncan argue that the interaction has therefore started long before the emission of signal and idler photons that we expect\nto arise as result. Thus we can extend the interaction time t0!\u00001 andt!1 .\nWith the revised limits of integration, the integral is somewhat easier to handle if the pump \feld is represented as\nits frequency components. This is in general true for any pump spectral shape [72]. We shall examine two cases in\nour analysis, (1) a CW pump of \fnite line width and (2) a pulsed mode-locked pump whose spectral characteristics\nare given as\n1. Continuous wave (CW) pump: The pump \feld for a CW laser may be expressed as ~ \u000B(t) =R\nd!P\u000B(!P)e\u0000i!Pt\nwith spectral mode shape function \u000B(!P). We consider a Gaussian spectral pro\fle model for \u000B(!P) of the form,\n\u000B(!P) = exp(\u0000(!P\u0000!P0)2=2\u001B2\nP) (A6)\nwhere!P;0is the pump center frequency and \u001BPis the pump linewidth.13\n2. Mode-locked pump laser: For the present analysis the mode locked laser is modelled as a sum of CW-like laser\nlines separated by preset frequency separations given by\n\u000B(!P) =NX\nn=\u0000NS(!P) exp\u0012\u0000(!P\u0000!P;0\u0000n\u0001!P)2\n2\u001B2\nP\u0013\n; (A7)\nwhereS(!P) is the overall mode envelope function for the laser. For a comb source with a Gaussian gain\nenvelope, we choose S(!) =exp(\u0000(!\u0000!P0)2=2\u001B2\nP;BW ) to be the standard functional form, where \u001BP;BW is the\ncomb bandwidth.\nIrrespective of the pump shape, the integral in Eq. (A4) then becomes\nZt\nt0dt0^Hint(t0) =AZ1\n\u00001dt0ZL\n0dzZ\nd!IZ\nd!S^ay\nI(!I) ^ay\nS(!S)Z\nd!P\u000B(!P)\n\u0002e\u0000if[kI(!I)+kS(!S)\u0000kP(!P)]z\u0000[!I+!S\u0000!P]tg+ H.c. (A8)\nThe time integral is performed \frst, yielding a 2 \u0019\u000E(!I+!S\u0000!P) term. Subsequently integration over the length of\nthe crystal yields,\nZt\nt0dt0^Hint(t0) =2\u0019AZ\nd!IZ\nd!S^ay\nI(!I) ^ay\nS(!S)\u0002\u000B(!S+!I) \b (!S;!I) + H.c.

For a generic interaction Hamiltonian\nHint(t) acting on the initial state j (t0)ifromt0tot, the \fnal state (upto a second order Dyson series expansion)\ncan be expressed as,\nj (t)i=\"\n1 +1\ni~Zt\nt0dt0^Hint(t0) +1\n(i~)2Zt\nt0dt0Zt0\nt0dt00^Hint(t0)^Hint(t00)#\nj (t0)i: (A11)\nSuch an expansion yields the following characteristic quantum state after the necessary integrals are evaluated.\nZeroth Order Term | The zeroth order approximation describes the regime without any nonlinear \feld interaction.\nHence, this simply yields the broadband vacuum term j0;0i.\nFirst Order Term | The \frst order Dyson expansion yields the term in which a single pair of signal and idler\nphotons are created. Their spectral characteristics are governed by the joint spectral amplitude (JSA), J(!S;!I) =\n\u000B(!S+!I)\b(!S;!I) i.e. a product of the pump spectral function and the PMF. The state may then be expanded as\nj (1)i=2\u0019A\ni~Z\nd!IZ\nd!S\u000B(!S+!I) \b(!S;!I) ^ay\nS(!S) ^ay\nI(!I)j0;0i (A12a)\n\u0011g(1)Z Z\nd!Id!SJ(!S;!I) ^ay\nS(!S) ^ay\nI(!I)j0;0i: (A12b)\nHere, we make the simpli\fcation g(1)= 2\u0019A=i ~. It is important to note here that the JSA for the mode locked pump\nis a summation of JSA terms for the CW pump. Further, the mode spacing (\u0001 !P) is typically much smaller than the\noverall envelope's bandwidth, \u001BP;BW ; thus the overall JSA may be modelled by that of the pump envelope, rather\nthe individual pump spectral lines.\nSecond Order Term | The second order term must account for time-ordering e\u000Bects of subsequent down-conversion\nsteps. Ref.

Each SPDC process\ngenerates a signal-idler pair; an entangled pair source is modelled to comprise of two SPDC processes. Let us label\nthe signal and idler as SandIrespectively; additionally let us associate the subscript (say k) to the entangled pair\nsource. The superscript is used to label the signal-idler pair (or equivalently, which constituent SPDC process). So\nthe mode label S(2)\nasigni\fes the signal of the second SPDC process for the entangled pair source labelled a.\nSince the idler beams are swapped, we can assume the mode ordering to be S(1)\nk;I(2)\nk;S(2)\nk;I(1)\nkto get the standard\nstate expansion,\ne can assume the mode ordering to be S(1)\nk;I(2)\nk;S(2)\nk;I(1)\nkto get the standard\nstate expansion, where k=a;bdetermines which entangled pair source (of two) we are referring to.

We \frst assume a repetition\nrate of 1 GHz for the mode-locked pump laser, with each comb width being 12.5 GHz (matching that of the DWDM channel\nas explained later). We also take the SPDC material to be magnesium-oxide doped LiNbO 3. Using the Sellmeier equations for\nboth the signal (extraordinary) and the idler (ordinary) photons, and applying a Gaussian approximation [32], we can compute\nthe phase matching function \b( !S;!I). Multiplying \u000B(!P) with \b(!S;!I), we then obtain the JSA function. Figure S3 shows\nthe three functions respectively.\nWe further assume a Gaussian spectral pro\fle for the DWDM channel that shapes the JSA, as illustrated in Fig. S4. To\nquantify the level of separability, we perform Schmidt decomposition on the JSA to extract its eigenvalues \u0015mwith orthonormal\nbasis vectorsfum(!)g;fvm(!)g[32]:\nJ(!s;!i) =X\nmp\n\u0015mum(!s)vm(!i) (B1)\nwhere\nZ\nK1(!;!0)um(!0)d!0=\u0015mum(!)

For calculations presented in the main\ntext, we assumed a timing uncertainty of 1 ps [38] corresponding to 1 THz, which greatly exceeds 12.5 GHz. However, even\nwith ideal detection, the heralded photonic Bell state composed by the signal photons from two SPDC sources may still have18\n(a)(b)\nFIG. S4.

The\ncalculated entropy based on Schmidt decomposition is S= 0:446.\na complex spectral shape, which may lead to in\fdelity caused by the mode conversion step. This is largely a consequence of\nusing a frequency comb source with a repetition rate comparable to the DWDM channel width.\nTwo avenues to circumvent this issue are (i) injecting a complex pump pulse shape in the MC corresponding to the spectral\nshape in the heralded Bell state or (ii) engineering the JSA function [32]. For the calculated example shown in Fig. S3 and\nFig. S4, we take the latter approach by matching the pump linewidth to the DWDM channel bandwidth and increasing the\ne\u000Bective crystal length. As a result, the DWDM-\fltered JSI shows a near Gaussian pro\fle, as assumed in Appendix C.\nLastly, we consider the case of having non-ideal detectors, with the inverse of the jitter time being smaller than 12.5 GHz.\nIn this scenario, the two-photon interference visibility is determined by the purity of the DWDM-\fltered state.\nWe follow Ref.

However, we note that the spectral pro\fle of the heralded\nphotonic Bell state would be convolved with the detector's instrument response function, likely demanding further shaping on\nthe MC's pump pulse. For this reason, we assume a su\u000Eciently small detector jitter and leave the e\u000Bect of imperfect detection\nfor future studies.\nAppendix C: Frequency and Bandwidth Conversion\nRecall that the quantum state of the cavity is\nj\tcavi\u0011 a(t)j10i+ b(t)j01i; (C1)\nwherej10icorresponds to the photon being in mode awhilej01icorresponds to the photon being in mode b.

For LiNbO 3-based PIC,\npropagation loss has been shown to be negligible even for device length exceeding 100 \u0016m [39]. For simplicity, we neglect metal\nabsorption loss stemming from nearby electrodes used to drive the electro-optic phase shifters. Rather, we assume the main\nloss mechanism to come from imperfection in the directional couplers. We take a state-of-the-art value of \u00180.2 dB per MZI\ndemonstrated on SOI [7\nthe directional couplers. We take a state-of-the-art value of \u00180.2 dB per MZI\ndemonstrated on SOI [75] to illustrate the e\u000Bect of switching array loss on the entanglement generation rate. Fig. S7 shows\ncomparable rates as the non-MZI-based scheme shown in the main text, up until k\u0019104. After which point, the k-dependent\nswitching array loss begins reducing the entanglement generation rate.\nThis particular qRX setup requires heterogeneous integration of diamond color centers into PICs, a feat which has already\nbeen demonstrated by Ref.

Silicon-vacancy center\nThe proposed architecture considers diamond's negatively-charged silicon-vacancy center as the atomic memory. With an ap-\nplied magne\nrs diamond's negatively-charged silicon-vacancy center as the atomic memory. With an ap-\nplied magnetic \feld and accounting for only Zeeman splitting, the energy ground state splits into two electron spin states j#iand\nj\"i.

On the other hand, if it is in the j\"istate that is decoupled with the cavity mode, r=\u00001. As a result of this\nstate-dependent phase di\u000Berence, the probe photon is entangled with the spin via cavity re\rection.\n3.

Upon entering the receiver node, we envision\nusing a polarization-splitter rotator to convert the polarization basis to the spatial basis faH;aVg. Importantly, we re-write\nthe joint state as j\ti=\u000BjaH;#i+\u000BjaH;\"i+\fjaV;#i+\fjaV;\"i. Subsequently, mode aHacquires a spin-dependent phase\nupon cavity re\rection, whereas mode aVacquires a constant \u00001 phase from re\rection o\u000B a mirror.

Although the main text provides a speci\fc example for a satellite-assisted architecture for global scale networks, we show\nhere that the same qTX can be equally bene\fcial for ground-only quantum networks. Figure S10 shows the rate of generating\nentanglement between A and B, with a midpoint source C equidistant from the two qRX's. We assume AB= 2LGG= 102km\nwith corresponding classical communication time of 30 ms an\nthe two qRX's. We assume AB= 2LGG= 102km\nwith corresponding classical communication time of 30 ms and \u000F= 10\u00003. Again, we compare the rate performance between\nZALM and a free-running narrowband-\fltered SPDC for channel losses \u000B=f50;60;70;80gdB accounting for the attenuation\nloss in optical \fbers. Additionally, we assume the qRX containing a fast-switching PIC whose MZI tree array causes com-\npounded loss dependent on the number of tree layers. In the memory-limited regime with k\u001510, ZALM already outperforms\nSPDC by at least an order of magnitude in \u0016\u0000. The gap in rate widens further with greater channel loss.

In particular, they are generally insensitive\nto mechanical vibrations. Here, we successfully demonstrate the coherent coupling of mechanics to a\nsingle nuclear spin. This coupling is mediated by a silicon vacancy (SiV) centre in diamond, taking\nadvantage of its large strain susceptibility and hyper\fne interaction with nuclear spins. Importantly,\nwe demonstrate that the nuclear spin retains its excellent coherence properties even in the presence\nof this coupling. This provides a way to leverage nuclear spins as quantum memories for mechanical\nsystems in the quantum regime.\nMechanical systems are at the forefront of investiga-\ntions in quantum physics [1{4]. Examples include the re-\nalisation of quantum states of mechanical resonators [5],\nquantum squeezing of mechanical motion [6], and cou-\npling of mechanics to other quantum systems [4, 7{16].\nHowever, their size induces signi\fcant coupling to their\nenvironment, which limits their coherence [3, 17, 18],\nand reaching coherence times \u0018100\u0016s requires com-\nplex phononic shielding [3]. On the other hand, nuclear\nspins display coherence times several orders of magnitude\nlonger, the longest among all solid-state systems [19, 20],\nmaking them desirable quantum memories [19, 21, 22].\nThis is due to their insensitivity to the environment, in\nparticular to lattice vibrations. In this work, we achieve\ncoherent coupling of mechanical\nnment, in\nparticular to lattice vibrations. In this work, we achieve\ncoherent coupling of mechanical vibrations to an individ-\nual13C nuclear spin in diamond. We utilize the large\nstrain susceptibility [23, 24] and the hyper\fne coupling\n[25{27] of the negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV)\ncentre to mediate this interaction. We con\frm that the\nnuclear spin retains its excellent coherence properties,\nthus demonstrating the coherent coupling of mechanics\nto long-lived quantum memories.\nIn our experiments, the mechanical vibrations are sur-\nface acoustic waves (SAWs), which have natural two-\ndimensional con\fnement, can be guided on chip, and\nare easily generated by electrical excitation of interdigital\ntransducers (IDTs) [15]. We pattern aluminium IDTs on\ntop of a layer of piezoelectric aluminium nitride deposited\non the surface of a single-crystal diamond. The diamond\nsample is ultra pure (nitrogen concentration \u003C5 ppb)\nand has a natural abundance of the13C isotope (1 :1%).\nThe diamond is implanted with28Si+ions and annealed\nto form SiV centres, which can be optically addressed in-\ndividually. The SiVs are located within the strain \feld of\nthe SAW, which extends about a wavelength ( \u00183\u0016m)\nbelow the surface of the diamond (Fig. 1a). The sample\nis cooled to below 200 mK in a dilution refrigerator to\n\u0003These authors contributed equally.\nyloncar@seas.harvard.eduincrease the lifetime of the SiV electron spin ( S= 1=2)\n[28]. An external magnetic \feld of 0 :13 T at an angle of\n90\u000Ewith respect to the SiV axis lifts the spin degeneracy\nand introduces a splitting of f#\"= 3:42 GHz between the\nj#iandj\"ispin states (Fig. 1b). The optical transition\nlabelled##0can be excited resonantly by laser pulses to\ninitialize the SiV in j\"ivia optical pumping, while the #\"\ntransition can be driven acoustically to coherently trans-\nfer population between j#iandj\"i[15].\nThe mechanical coupling to the13C nuclear spin ( S=\n1=2) relies on the simultaneous coupling of an SiV elec-\ntronic spin to a\no the13C nuclear spin ( S=\n1=2) relies on the simultaneous coupling of an SiV elec-\ntronic spin to acoustic waves and to the nuclear spin.

This can be utilized to control the\nnuclear spin state [27, 29, 30] with the basic sequence\ndepicted in Fig. 1c.

A \ft (red curve) to the data yields the hyper\fne\ncoupling parameters fAk= 0:11 MHz;A?= 0:33 MHzgfor\nthe target nuclear spin [32].\nwork.\nWe identify a target13C spin by performing nuclear\nspin resonance spectroscopy using the SiV [29, 30]. The\nSiV spin is initialized in j\"i, after which an acoustic pulse\nperforms a \u0019=2 rotation of the spin to bring it into the\nsuperposition state ( j\"i+j#i)=p\n2. A series of acoustic \u0019-\npulses then perform an XY8 sequence [33], whereby the\nSiV spin is \ripped repeatedly around two di\u000Berent axes\n(X;Y ) on the Bloch sphere, depending on the phase (0 or\n\u0019=2) of each pulse (Fig. 2a). A \fnal acoustic \u0019=2 pulse is\nthen applied to the SiV spin, before its state is read out\nby optical excitation of the ##0transition and collection of\nthe resulting \ruorescence. This pulse sequence increases\nthe coherence time of the SiV spin by decoupling it from\nmagnetic \feld noise [32], while allowing its selective cou-\npling to individual13C nuclear spins. Figure 2b shows\nthe measurement of the SiV population in j#iafter an\nXY8 sequence, as the inter-pulse time \u001Cis varied. For\nvalues of\u001Ccorresponding to resonance with a particular3\n13C spin, the SiV spin state coherently evolves in con-\njunction with the nuclear spin. This appears as periodic\nsharp dips. The m\noherently evolves in con-\njunction with the nuclear spin. This appears as periodic\nsharp dips. The most prominent dips in Fig. 2b can be\nascribed to a single nuclear spin, and their positions and\ndepths can be modelled to extract the hyper\fne coupling\nparametersfAk= 0:11 MHz;A?= 0:33 MHzg[32].\nHaving identi\fed the target nuclear spin, we proceed\nto initialize it. The sequence for nuclear spin initializa-\ntion is shown in Fig. 3a. It consists of \u0019=2 rotations of the\nSiV spin and conditional rotations of the nuclear spin im-\nplemented as XY8 sequences on the SiV spin [27, 29, 30].\nWe simulate the state of the nuclear spin at the end of\nthe initialization sequence, for values of the inter-pulse\ndelay\u001Cin the vicinity of the \u001C= 1:578\u0016s resonance,\nas shown in Fig. 3b. For \u001C= 1:569\u0016s, if the SiV is\nset toj\"iSiV(j#iSiV) at the beginning of the sequence,\nthe nuclear spin is initialized in j#inuc(j\"inuc) at the end\nof it. The nuclear spin readout sequence corresponds to\nthe same sequence in reverse, and transfers the nuclear\nspin onto the SiV spin. The experimental results for the\nfull sequence for various values of \u001Care shown as dots\nin Fig. 3c, with simulations shown as solid curves. For\n\u001C= 1:569\u0016s, the \fnal state of the SiV depends on the\nstate the nuclear spin was initialized in. The experimen-\ntal data agree with the expected results from the simu-\nlation, thus con\frming the successful initialization and\nreadout of the nuclear spin. The parasitic partial ad-\ndressing of other13C nuclear spins with similar hyper\fne\ncouplings to the SiV limits the \fdelity of the initialization\nand readout sequences to 0 :91 [32]. The experimentally\nmeasured \fdelities are 0 :85\u00060:03 and 0:91\u00060:02 for ini-\ntialization into the j#inucandj\"inucstates respectively,\nwith readout \fdelities equal to the initialization \fdelities.\nAlthough a similar initialization sequence could be con-\nstructed with \u001C= 1:586\u0016s, its \fdelity is inferior as seen\nin Fig. 3c, due to parasitic partial addressing of other\n\u001C= 1:586\u0016s, its \fdelity is inferior as seen\nin Fig. 3c, due to parasitic partial addressing of other\nnuclear spins. The \fdelity can be improved by operat-\ning at longer inter-pulse delay times, to better resolve\nindividual nuclear spin resonances.\nIf the inter-pulse delay is \u001C0= 1:578\u0016s, the XY8 se-\nquence rotates the nuclear spin around the X-axis of the\nBloch sphere by an angle dependent on the number of\npulsesN0in the sequence. By inserting such an XY8 se-\nquence between the nuclear spin initialization and read-\nout sequences (Fig. 3d), and varying N0, we perform co-\nherent rotations of the nuclear spin, as demonstrated by\nthe observation of Rabi oscillations shown in Fig. 3e. We\nnote thatN0= 8 corresponds to a \u0019=2-rotation of the\nnuclear spin.\nWe then evaluate the coherence of the nuclear spin\nunder mechanical control, using Ramsey interferometry.\nWe perform two \u0019=2-rotations of the nuclear spin sep-\narated by a variable delay, whereby the nuclear spin is\nbrought into a superposition state that precesses freely\nbefore being read out (Fig. 4a). Immediately after the\n\frst\u0019=2-rotation of the nuclear spin, the SiV is initialized\nin eitherj#i(red dots) orj\"i(blue dots), which causes\nthe nuclear spin to precess at a rate that depends on thestate of the SiV spin, as shown in Fig. 4b, with precession\nfrequencies fRamsey\n\";#=p\n(fL\u0006Ak=2)2+ (A?=2)2. This\ndi\u000Berence in precession frequencies con\frms that we ad-\ndress a single nuclear spin. We repeat the measurement\nfor longer free precession times for a single orientation\nof the SiV spin, as displayed in Fig. 4c. The amplitude\nof the Ramsey oscillations does not decrease up to pre-\ncession times of 2 ms, indicating that the nuclear spin\nretains its coherence above this timescale, T\u0003\n2\u001D2 ms.\nNext, we perform a spin echo sequence by inserting a\nnuclear\u0019-rotation between the two \u0019=2-rotations, as il-\nlustrated in Fig. 4d. The \u0019-rotation cancels the impact\nof any dephasing mechanism that is slower than the free\nprecession timesc\notation cancels the impact\nof any dephasing mechanism that is slower than the free\nprecession timescale. The nuclear spin state at the end of\nthe sequence is plotted as a function of the total preces-\nsion time in Fig. 4e and shows no sign of decay, indicating\nTecho\n2\u001D10 ms. Due to the limited photon collection e\u000E-\nciency of our system, measurements for longer precession\ntimes are impractical, considering the experimental times\nrequired. Nevertheless, our measurements con\frm that\nthe13C nuclear spin retains long coherence times [19, 27]\nunder mechanical control.\nIn conclusion, we coherently couple surface acoustic\nwaves to a single13C nuclear spin using an SiV centre\nas an interface, and show that the nuclear spin retains\nits excellent coherence properties. Future developments\ninclude integration with photonic structures such as ta-\npered waveguides, which would increase the photon col-\nlection e\u000Eciency and enable single-shot spin readout [28].\nFurthermore, this method can be extended to other nu-\nclear spins. Using an SiV with a resident29Si nuclear\nspin enables the resolution of hyper\fne energy levels [25],\nwhich can be used to achieve entanglement between the\nSiV and the nuclear spin with a single \u0019-pulse. At the\nsame time, strong coupling between the SiV spin and a\nsingle phonon could be achieved using a high quality fac-\ntor, low mode volume mechanical resonator [23, 34, 35],\nthus enabling single-phonon spin gates. This would en-\nable the use of single nuclear spins as quantum memo-\nries for phononic states, with applications in metrology,\nquantum sensing [36], quantum information processing\n[11, 18, 37{39], and fundamental tests of quantum theory\n[2, 40, 41]. Finally, diamond possesses a large Young's\nmodulus allowing mechanical resonators to reach fre-\nquencies in the GHz range, thus making their mechanical\nground states reachable with dilution refrigerators. This,\ncombined with recent progress in diamond nanofabrica-\ntion, makes diamond an ideal platform for\nhis,\ncombined with recent progress in diamond nanofabrica-\ntion, makes diamond an ideal platform for non-classical\nmechanics experiments, while taking advantage of the re-\nmarkable coherence properties of nuclear spins.\nI.

A home-built optical microscope is used for op-\ntical excitation and \ruorescence collection. A tunable\nlaser stabilized to an accuracy of 0 :01 pm using feedback\nfrom a waveleng\nnce collection. A tunable\nlaser stabilized to an accuracy of 0 :01 pm using feedback\nfrom a wavelength meter is used to resonantly excite op-\ntical transitions of individual SiVs. Photons emitted by\nindividual SiVs in the phonon side band (PSB) \u003E740 nm\nare selected by an optical long-pass \flter and sent to an\navalanche photodiode (APD).\nC. Generation of optical and acoustic pulses\nLaser pulses at 737 nm are generated using an acousto-\noptic modulator (AOM). The AOM is driven by a\ncustom-built RF driver and is used in a double-pass con-\n\fguration to achieve an extinction ratio \u003E70 dB that is\nrequired to prevent unwanted optical spin pumping dur-\ning long experimental sequences. A time-correlated sin-\ngle photon counter (TCSPC) is used to record arrival\ntimes of photons emitted from the SiV. An arbitrary\nwaveform generator (AWG) controls the entire experi-\nmental sequence. The 8-bit analog output of the AWG\nis used to drive the IDTs, while the two 1-bit marker\noutputs are used to control the AOM and trigger the\nTCSPC. There is a small amount of drift between theclocks of the AWG and TCSPC, with a factor of about\n1:25\u000210\u00005, which we correct for in our data processing.\nD. SiV spin initialization\nThe SiV can be initialized in j\"iorj#iby resonantly\npumping the optical transitions ##0or\"\"0respectively.\nFor our experiments, after the acoustic \u0019-pulse is cali-\nbrated, we initialize the SiV in j\"iby optically pumping\n##0, and inj#iby optically pumping ##0followed by an\nacoustic\u0019-pulse. This allows keeping the wavelength of\nthe laser resonant with the ##0transition. We insert an\nacoustic\u0019-pulse between the \fnal optical readout pulse\nof one experimental sequence and the optical initializa-\ntion pulse of the next sequence, so that the SiV is in\nj#ibefore the initialization pulse. This allows the pho-\nton counts during the initialization pulse to be used as a\nmeasure of the population in j#i.\nE. SiV spin population measurement\nThe SiV \ruorescence is integrated for the \frst 100 ns\nion in j#i.\nE. SiV spin population measurement\nThe SiV \ruorescence is integrated for the \frst 100 ns\nof optical pumping.

The spin projection of the SiV is cal-\nculated ash\u001Bzi= 1\u00002P#, in whichP#is the population\nin thej#istate.\nF. Nuclear spin rotations\nFor the value of \u001C= 1:569\u0016s used for nuclear initial-\nization and readout, the rotation angle is calculated to\nbe\u001E= 0:62\u0019, with the conditional rotation axes being\nn\"= (0:77;0;0:64) and n#= (\u00000:69;0;0:72).\nTheX-rotations of the nuclear spin during the Rabi\nand Ramsey interferometry sequences are actually con-\nditional rotations of the form R\u001E\n\u0000x;xfor the inter-pulse\ntime\u001C0= 1:578\u0016s. However, since the electron spin is\ninitialized inj\"iat the end of the initialization sequence,\nthe nuclear spin only rotates about the + X-axis.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Neil Sinclair, Bartholomeus\nMachielse, Can Knaut, Mihir Bhaskar, David Levonian,\nChristian Nguyen, Hans Bartling, and Tim Taminiau for\nhelpful discussions.

Analogous to classical com-\nputer networks, quantum networks allow for the distribu-\ntion of quantum computation among quantum comput-\ners. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol\nto perform distributed quantum computing in a quantum\nnetwork. The protocol uses a quantum walk as a quantum\ncontrol signal to perform distributed quantum operations.\nWe consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined\nquantum walk model that accounts for the interaction\nbetween a quantum walker system in the network graph\nwith quantum registers inside the network nodes. The\nprotocol logically captures distributed quantum com-\nputing, abstracting hardware implementation and the\ntransmission of quantum information through channels.\nControl signal transmission is mapped to the propagation\nof the walker system across the network, while interac-\ntions between the control layer and the quantum registers\nare embedded into the application of coin operators.\nWe demonstrate how to use the quantum walker system\nto perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows\nthe universality of the protocol for distributed quantum\ncomputing. Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the\ntask of entanglement distribution in a quantum network.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networking is an innovative, multidisci-\nplinary ﬁeld of research that promises revolutionary\nimprovements in communications, enabling tasks and\napplications that are impossible to achieve with the\nexclusive exchange of c\nons, enabling tasks and\napplications that are impossible to achieve with the\nexclusive exchange of classical information [1], [2].\nSimilar to a classical computer network, a quantum\nnetwork is a distributed system composed of quantum\ncomputers and quantum repeaters that exchange quan-\ntum information across physical channels. Among ap-\nplications supported by quantum networks, distributed\nquantum computing is of particular interest as it lever-\nages the power of interconnected quantum computers\nto create a virtual quantum machine with processing\ncapabilities that surpass its physical constituents alone[3]–[5]. Distributed quantum computing becomes even\nmore interesting in the noise intermediate scale quan-\ntum machines (NISQ) scenario where there is a clear\ntradeoff between the size of quantum computers, in\nterms of number of qubits, and the ﬁdelity of quan-\ntum operations, given the fact that physical separation\ndirectly reduces cross talk among qubits [6]. When\nthe quantum network scenario is considered, the com-\nplexity of distributed quantum computing extends in at\nleast two dimensions. First, physical quantum channels\nhave a well known depleting effect in the exchange\nof quantum data, e.g., the exponential decrease in\nchannel entanglement rate with distance [7]. Second,\nthere is a demand for a quantum network protocol\ncapable of performing a desired distributed quantum\noperation while accounting for network connectivity.\nGeneric quantum computation with qubits in distinct\nquantum processors demands either the application of\nremote controlled gates [8] or the incessant exchange\nof quantum information. For both cases, a network\nprotocol is necessary to orchestrate the communication\nbetween nodes that are not directly connected with one\nanother.\nOne challenge in the design of a control protocol\nis the need for being agnostic to hardware imple-\nmentations. There is a plethora of physical systems\nsuited for quantum computation under investigation,\ne.g., superconduct\n plethora of physical systems\nsuited for quantum computation under investigation,\ne.g., superconducting qubits [9], trapped ions [10], [11]\nand Silicon-vacancy color centers in diamond [12],\n[13]. In addition, there is a diverse investigation in the\narchitectural description of quantum interconnecting\ndevices capable of exchanging quantum information\nencoded in distinct quantum physical quantities [14].\nThis diverse ecosystem of quantum network tech-\nnologies indicates that distributed quantum computing\nnetwork protocols need to abstract physical implemen-\ntations of quantum switches and network connectivity\nwhile maintaining universality requirements.The goal of this article is to propose a control\nprotocol for distributed quantum computing based on\ndiscrete time quantum walks [15]. Quantum walks are\nuniversal for quantum computing [16]–[18] and have\nbeen successfully employed in the quantum network\nscenario to perform perfect state transfer (PST) be-\ntween network nodes [19], [20], teleportation [21], [22]\nand quantum key distribution (QKD) [23]. Previous\nworks describe ways of distributing entanglement be-\ntween nodes on a quantum network using the coin\nspace of the walker to propel entanglement generation\nbetween qubits [20], [21]. In addition, the formalism\nof quantum walks with multiple coins enabled the\ndescription of an entanglement routing protocol, which\ninterprets qubits within a network node as vertices\nof an abstract graph used by a quantum walker to\ngenerate entanglement [24]. In spite of their relevance,\nthe quantum walk approaches deﬁned in the literature\nare suited to particular network structures and quantum\noperations. In particular, they consider the case of\nregular lattices, describing walker dynamics on regular\nstructures and do not address how the quantum walk\ncan be used to perform generic distributed quantum op-\nerators. In this context, this work adds to the literature\nof both quantum walks and quantum networks with\nthe description of a qua\nwork adds to the literature\nof both quantum walks and quantum networks with\nthe description of a quantum network control protocol\nthat can be applied to arbitrary graphs and perform\nuniversal quantum computing in a quantum network.\nA. Contributions\nThe contributions of this article are three-fold.\n•We propose a quantum walk protocol for dis-\ntributed quantum computing in a quantum net-\nwork. The protocol uses a quantum walker system\nas a quantum control signal to perform computa-\ntions among quantum processors that are physi-\ncally separated. We assume that each processor\ndedicates part of its internal quantum register to\nrepresent the walker control signal and describe\nhow the control subsystem interacts with the data\nsubsystem. The interaction between data and con-\ntrol is speciﬁed by unitary operations that nodes\nneed to implement in order to realize the quantum\nwalk control plane.\n•We show the universality of the protocol by\ndescribing how a 2-qubit controlled X(CNOT)\noperation between qubits in distinct nodes of the\nnetwork can be performed with the quantum walk.\nThe protocol is universal in the sense that it allows\nfor any quantum operation in the Hilbert space\nformed by all qubits in the data subsystem of thenodes. Furthermore, it is generic in the sense that\nit abstracts hardware implementation and channel\ntransmissions, while being well-deﬁned for any\nnetwork topology.\n•We demonstrate how the protocol can be used\nto recover the behavior of entanglement distribu-\ntion protocols previously described in the litera-\nture [25], [26].\nThe description of the protocol is carried in the\nlogical setting under the assumption that quantum error\ncorrection processes ensure unitary operations for both\ncontrol and data qubits.\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows.\nIn Section 2, we present the mathematical background\nneeded for the description of the quantum walk pro-\ntocol. We describe the quantum walk protocol and\ndemonstrate its universality in Section\nm walk pro-\ntocol. We describe the quantum walk protocol and\ndemonstrate its universality in Section 3. The descrip-\ntion is extended to case of multiple walkers in Section\n4. In Section 5, we apply the protocol to recover\nthe behavior of entanglement distribution protocols.\nFinally, the manuscript is concluded in Section 6.\nII. B ACKGROUND\nConsider the graph G= (V,E). Letδ(v)denote\nthe set of neighbors of node v∈Vandd(v) =|δ(v)|\ndenote the degree of v. Let∆(u,v)denote the hop-\ndistance between uandvinG. Throughout this work\nwe refer to the inverse of a binary string x∈ {0,1}∗\nasx. A quantum network is a set of quantum hosts\n(quantum processors) interconnected by a set of quan-\ntum channels that allow for the exchange of quantum\ninformation [2]. A host is either a quantum repeater, a\nquantum router or a quantum computer with a ﬁxed\nnumber of qubits, which performs generic quantum\noperations. A quantum network can be represented as\na symmetric directed graph N= (V,E). Each node\nv∈Vrepresents a quantum host that has a set Mvof\nqubits that can be processed together at any time and a\nsetNvof qubits that is used to exchange quantum in-\nformation with nodes in its neighborhood δ(v)through\na set of quantum channels. More precisely, each edge\n(u,v)∈Erepresents a quantum channel connecting\nthe qubits in NuandNvwhich can interact through\noperations mediated by the channel. We will refer to\nNvandMvas the control and data registers of node v,\nrespectively. The sets M=/uniontext\nvMvandN=/uniontext\nvNv\nare respectively referred to as the network control plane\nand the network data plane .\nThis network model separates the qubit registers\nin the nodes into control and data registers. This\nchoice differs from previous works where the set ofqubitsNthat can interact with quantum channels are\nconsidered alone [25], [26]. Note that considering only\ncontrol qubits sufﬁces to deﬁne entanglement routing\nprotocols. Nonetheless, it is straightforward for the\ngoal of describing a quantum netwo\nent routing\nprotocols. Nonetheless, it is straightforward for the\ngoal of describing a quantum network control plane\nprotocol to consider the separation between control and\ndata registers in the nodes.\nA. Quantum network protocols\nConsider the system formed by two quantum pro-\ncessorsuandvconnected by a channel and their\nrespective qubits. A local operation is a quantum\ntransformation represented as a separable operator of\nthe form\nO=Ou⊗Ov, (1)\nwhereOuandOvact on the state space of the qubits\nat processors uandv, respectively. A local operation\nassisted by two-way classical communication (LOCC)\nis a local operation that depends on classical informa-\ntion exchanged between nodes [7], e.g., the unitaries\nof quantum teleportation. The classical information is\nused to select operators applied to the system, which is\nembedded in the formalism by averaging non-unitary\nmeasurement operators into trace-preserving operators.\nA quantum network protocol for Nis an algorithm that\noperates on the qubits at the nodes, transforming their\njoint state by an LOCC ¯Λtas\nρ(t) =¯Λtρ(0)¯Λ†\nt, (2)\nwheretis the number of rounds in the protocol, ρis a\ndensity operator deﬁned on the Hilbert space HM∪N\nformed by all qubits on the network and ρ(0)is a\ndensity matrix where registers in distinct nodes are\nin a separable state. We express ¯Λt=/producttextt\nk=0Λkas\na product of other LOCCs each applied at different\ntime steps [27]. Note that it sufﬁces for ρ(0)to be a\nseparable density operator in [27]. In fact, it is also\npossible to model a protocol as a sequence of external\n(mediated by channels) and internal (local to vertices)\ntime-dependent superoperators AtandBtsuch that the\nstate of the network is described as\nρ(t+1) =Bt[At[ρ(t)]], (3)\nwhereρis a density matrix characterizing the joint\nstate of all network memories at discrete time t. As\nan example, it is usually the case for entanglement\ndistribution protocols that Atrepresents channel en-\ntanglement protocols performed in all channels of\nstribution protocols that Atrepresents channel en-\ntanglement protocols performed in all channels of\nthe network and Btrepresents either entanglement\nswapping operations or GHZ projections performedindependently in multiple nodes. The LOCC formalism\nhas proven useful since it allowed for the derivation of\nfundamental bounds for entanglement rate distribution\n[27]. In this article, however, our focus is to address\nnetwork protocols for the transmission of quantum\ninformation in the logical perspective. In particular, we\nexploit the representation in (3) considering AandB\nas unitary operators provided by the network instead of\ngeneric superoperators and perform the analysis in the\nstate vector formalism. It is worth emphasizing that the\nunitarity assumption for operators AandBtranslates\nto the assumption that quantum error correction is\nprovided by the network.\nB. Quantum walks on graphs\nThere are many ways to deﬁne a quantum walk\non a graph and this article focuses on the discrete-\ntime coined quantum walk model. Given a symmetric\ndirected graph G= (V,E), a coined quantum walk on\nGis a process of unitary evolution on the Hilbert space\nHG=HV⊗ HCformed by the edges of the graph,\nwhereHVcodiﬁes vertices and HCis the coin space\nof the walker codifying the degrees of freedom the\nwalker can move on. More precisely, every (v,u)∈E\ndeﬁnes a basis vector |v,c/a\\}bracketri}htforHGthrough a mapping\nbetween the edges incident to vwith the set of degrees\nof freedom Cv={0,1,...,d(v)−1}. As a convention,\nwe map the degrees of freedom of the walker at a given\nnodevto the order of labels of its neighbors, such\nthat|v,c/a\\}bracketri}htrefers to the edge (v,u), whereuis thec-\nth smallest label in δ(v). Later,cvuwill be used to\nrefer to the degree of freedom of vthat represents the\nedge(v,u)andcvto represent the self-loop (v,v). The\ngeneric state of the walker |Ψ(t)/a\\}bracketri}ht=/summationtextψ(v,c,t)|v,c/a\\}bracketri}ht\nis a superposition of the edges of Gand the walker\nevolution is \niontextψ(v,c,t)|v,c/a\\}bracketri}ht\nis a superposition of the edges of Gand the walker\nevolution is deﬁned as\n|Ψ(t+1)/a\\}bracketri}ht=S(t)C(t)|Ψ(t)/a\\}bracketri}ht, (4)\nwhereCandSare respectively referred to as the coin\nand shift operators. The coin is a unitary operator of\nthe form\nC(t) =/summationdisplay\nv|v/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tv|⊗Cv(t), (5)\nwhereCv:HC→ HC. The shift can be deﬁned as any\npermutation operator on the edges of the graph that\nmaps an edge (v1,u)to an edge (u,v2). This mapping\nof edges represents a permutation between states |v1,c/a\\}bracketri}ht\nand|u,c′/a\\}bracketri}ht, whereuis thec-th neighbor of v1. Two shift\noperators are used throughout this work: the identityoperator, which is a trivial permutation of the edges,\nand the ﬂip-ﬂop shift operator given by\nSf=/summationdisplay\nv∈V/summationdisplay\nu∈δ(v)|v,cvu/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tu,cuv|, (6)\nwhich applies, for every (v,u)∈E, the permutation\n(v,u)→(u,v).Sfreverses edges in the walker\nwavefunction and is well deﬁned for every symmetric\ndirected graph. The label of nodes and degrees of\nfreedom are numerical and expressed as binary strings.\nIn this setting, the degree of freedom crepresents\nthe bit-wise negation of label c. Note that cvuis not\nnecessarilycuv.\nIII. Q UANTUM WALK NETWORK CONTROL PLANE\nA direct way of controlling operations in a quantum\nnetwork with a quantum walk is to consider a cou-\npled system between a walker and the qubits in the\nnodes, using supersposition in the walker system to\nimplement controlled unitary operations. We describe\nthis joint system in the logical setting. Let N′=\n(V,E∪ {(v,v),∀v∈V})be the graph obtained by\nadding self-loops to a network N.HW=HV⊗ HC\ndenotes the space of a walker system on N′and\nHg=HW⊗ HMdenotes the global Hilbert space\nspanned by the coupled systems. The walker system is\nassumed to be implemented in the networking control\nplane, such that HWis a subspace of HN. Since\nthe Hilbert space of the walker system represents an\nedge ofN′a\nch that HWis a subspace of HN. Since\nthe Hilbert space of the walker system represents an\nedge ofN′as a basis vector, the dimension of the\nHilbert space HNmust be at least |E|forHWto be a\nsubspace. We consider Hgas a subspace of HN⊗HM.\nA. Control-data interactions\nWe prescribe two laws of interaction between the\nquantum walk system and the data qubits in the net-\nwork. The ﬁrst generalizes a coin operator to the global\nHilbert space Hgfollowing\nC(t) =/summationdisplay\nv|v/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tv|⊗Cv(t)⊗Uv(t), (7)\nwhereCv(t) :HC→ HCis a unitary operator on the\ncoin space of the walker and Uv(t) :HM→ HMis\na unitary operator on the data space of the network\nwritten as\nUv(t) =Kv(t)/circlemultiplydisplay\nu/ne}ationslash=vIMv, (8)\nwhereIMvis the identity operator for the Hilbert\nspace spanned by all qubits of node v. Essentially, C(t)\napplies the operator Ku(t)on qubits in vif, and only\nif, the walker has a non-zero wavefunction componentinv. Note thatUv(t)is the extension of Kv(t), which\nacts inHMv, toHMwith the identity operator. Note\nthat the operator described in (7) extends the deﬁnition\nin (5) to perform unitary operations in the data qubit\nspace controlled by node position.\nThe second law of interaction deﬁnes controlled\noperations between the data qubits and the coin space\nof the walker. In particular, we consider the case where\nonly a single data qubit in a given node is used to\ncontrol a unitary operation in the coin space of the\nwalker. Let\nUvq(t) =/summationdisplay\ns∈{0,1}Uvqs(t)⊗|s/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{ts|/circlemultiplydisplay\nq′/ne}ationslash=qIq′ (9)\nbe a unitary operator acting on the coin space of node\nvcontrolled by the qubit q∈ Mvdeﬁned for the joint\nspaceHC⊗HM, wheresdenotes the state of q. The\ncomplete interaction has the form\nO(t) =/summationdisplay\nv|v/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tv|⊗Uvq(t). (10)\nThe operators correspond to a distributed implemen-\ntation of a quantum walk system in the network. In\nessence, each node vcontributes wi\nuted implemen-\ntation of a quantum walk system in the network. In\nessence, each node vcontributes with Nvto describe\nthe space HWinHN. Thus, (7) and (10) are operations\ncontrolled by the states of HNthat represent walker\nposition since |v/a\\}bracketri}htis implemented by an entangled state\namong qubits in N. This encapsulates the necessary\nentanglement required for distributed controlled opera-\ntions between the qubits of the network. As previously\nmentioned, we assume quantum error correction and\ndescribe the walker protocol in terms of logical qubits\nand operations. In the context of error correcting codes,\na single logical qubit is implemented by a set of\nphysical qubits [28], [29]. An implementation of the\nwalker demands O(log(|E|))logical qubits in Nsince\neach edge of N′is a basis vector of HWand the di-\nmension of the space spanned by qubits is exponential\nin the number of qubits. For practical implementations,\nnetwork models that consider physical networking\nqubits in the order of O(|E|)have exponentially many\nphysical qubits as the required number of logical qubits\nfor the walker, which is interesting for the purpose of\nquantum error correction.\nB. Universal distributed quantum computing\nThe interaction behavior described by (7) and (10)\nsufﬁces for universal quantum computing. Our protocol\ntrivially allows for the application of any separable\nqubit operator in the network nodes, since there is no\nneed for the interaction between data qubits and the\nwalker in this case. Thus, we demonstrate universalityby demonstrating how a CNOT gate between any pair\nof qubitsaandb, respectively at arbitrary nodes Aand\nB, can be performed using the quantum walk control\nplane. In fact, the demonstration works for any two-\nqubit controlled operation by substituting Xwith the\ndesired single-qubit operator. Without loss of gener-\nality, assume that ais the control qubit. To simplify\nnotation, we only deﬁne the operators C(t)in (7) and\nO(t)in (10) for the subspaces spanned by th\nify\nnotation, we only deﬁne the operators C(t)in (7) and\nO(t)in (10) for the subspaces spanned by the qubits\nin nodesAandB, considering undeﬁned operators\nto be identities, and omit the qubits in M \\ {a,b}.\nThe subscripts following degrees of freedom inside a\nket speciﬁes edges while the ones following qubits are\nconsidered as indices, e.g.,|A,cA,0a,1b/a\\}bracketri}ht ∈ HW⊗H4\nrepresents the walker in the self-loop (A,A),ain the\n|0/a\\}bracketri}htstate andbin the|1/a\\}bracketri}htstate, where H4is the Hilbert\nspace spanned by 2 qubits.\nWe consider the initial state of the walker to be\n|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht, which corresponds to the self-loop in A. Thus,\nthe global system is described by the state vector\n|Ψ(0)/a\\}bracketri}ht=|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht⊗(α|0a/a\\}bracketri}ht+β|1a/a\\}bracketri}ht)⊗|Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht,(11)\nwhere|Ψb/a\\}bracketri}htis the state of b. The interaction operator O\ndescribed in (10) is applied with the CNOT operation\nUAa=ICA⊗|0/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{t0|+XCA⊗|1/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{t1|, (12)\nwhereCArepresents the coin space of node Aand\nwhich trivially generates the entangled state\nO|Ψ(0)/a\\}bracketri}ht= (α|A,cA,0/a\\}bracketri}ht+β|A,cA,1/a\\}bracketri}ht)⊗|Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht.\n(13)\nThis entangled state can be propagated in the network\nthrough the evolution of the walker system such that\nthe state after propagation becomes\n|Ψ(t)/a\\}bracketri}ht= (α|A,cA,0/a\\}bracketri}ht+β|B,cB,1/a\\}bracketri}ht)⊗|Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht.(14)\nWe refer to the propagation of the walker as the\ntransmission of the control signal through the network,\nwhich will be further explained in detail. The last step\nrefers to the application of the extended coin operator\ndeﬁned in (7), with Kb=Xand all other operators\ndeﬁned as identity. The ﬁnal state obtained is\n|Ψ(t)/a\\}bracketri}ht=α|A,cA,0,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht+β/vextendsingle/vextendsingleB,cB,1,Ψb/angbracketrightbig\n,(15)\nwhich clearly shows the application of a CNOT con-\ntrolled byawithbas a target.\nNote that the stat\n)\nwhich clearly shows the application of a CNOT con-\ntrolled byawithbas a target.\nNote that the state obtained in (15) is entangled with\nthe walker subsystem. We will later demonstrate how\nto separate the data qubits from the walker.C. Protocol execution in the network\nIn the context of quantum network protocols, the\noperators deﬁned by (7) and (10) do not capture the\npropagation of control information across the network.\nThe propagation of quantum control information be-\ntween neighbors in the network is embedded in the\nformalism through the walker’s shift operator. The\npropagation in the case of non-neighboring nodes\nneeds both coin and shift operators as deﬁned in (5)\nand (6). Note that generic computation on the data\nqubits can be performed with (7) and (10) given states\nin the superposition (15), although it is not possible to\nevolve the walker to that superposition from |A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht\nwithout shift operators.\nWe deﬁne coin and shift operators that evolve the\nglobal state from (13) to (15). The quantum walk\nevolution is restricted to neighbor locality, such that,\nto have the state given in (15) at time t, all of the\nwavefunction at time t−1must exclusively be a\nsuperposition of edges incident to A,Band its neigh-\nbors. There are many ways to deﬁne coin and shift\noperators with this desired behavior and we consider\nthe case where the quantum walk traverses a single\npath connecting AandB. Some auxiliary deﬁnitions\nand assumptions are required to describe the operators\nin context. Let pbe a path of the network connecting\nAandBwith hop distance ∆(A,B). We assume\nthat every node knows the network topology and that\nclassical information can be transmitted across the\nnodes. Recall that the edges of N′are mapped to\nwalker states following the relation\n(v,u)→ |v,cvu/a\\}bracketri}ht, (16)\nand that the self-loop of node vis mapped to the degree\nof freedom cv, for allv. We refer to the edge that\nconnectsAto its neighbor in pas|A,cp\nA/a\\}bracketri}htand the\nreverse e\nv. We refer to the edge that\nconnectsAto its neighbor in pas|A,cp\nA/a\\}bracketri}htand the\nreverse edge that connects Bto its precedent node in\npas|B,cp\nB/a\\}bracketri}ht. This notation is depicted in Figure 1\nfor a 2D-grid network. If some quantum operation is\nperformed between AandBat a given time t, the\npropagation process starts at time t−∆(A,B).\nThe extended shift operator used to route informa-\ntion is ﬁxed and given by\nS=Sf⊗IM, (17)\nwhereSfis deﬁned in (6). The coin operator deﬁnition\nis also time-independent, although it depends on the\npathpchosen. All operators Cvin (7) have the form\nCp\nv=|c1/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tc2|+|c2/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tc1|+/summationdisplay\nc∈Cv\nc/ne}ationslash=c1,c2|c/a\\}bracketri}ht/a\\}bracketle{tc| (18)Au v wB\n(a) Pathpconnecting AandB.|A,cp\nA/an}bracketri}ht |v,cuA/an}bracketri}ht|v,cuv/an}bracketri}ht |u,cvu/an}bracketri}ht|u,cvw/an}bracketri}ht |w,cwv/an}bracketri}ht|w,cwB/an}bracketri}ht |B,cp\nB/an}bracketri}ht\n|A,cA/an}bracketri}htAuvwB\n(b) Map\nbetween edges\nand vectors.\nFig. 1: Notation for edges exempliﬁed in a grid graph.\nConsider that AandBare two nodes connected in\na 2D grid network. (a) pis a path connecting A\nandBwith hop-distance 4traversed by the walker.\n(b) Each edge on the path corresponds to a vector\ninHW, which appear in the walker wavefunction\nthroughout movement. The degrees of freedom are\ndeﬁned such that |x,cxy/a\\}bracketri}htrepresents edge (x,y). As\nan example, the ﬂip-ﬂop operator speciﬁed in (6) maps\n|v,cvu/a\\}bracketri}ht → |u,cuv/a\\}bracketri}ht, while the operator Cudeﬁned in\nterms of (18) maps |u,cuA/a\\}bracketri}ht → |u,cuv/a\\}bracketri}ht.\nwherec1andc2refer to the degrees of freedom that\nrepresent the edges incident to vinp. Thus, we deﬁne\nCp\nvspecifyingc1andc2for the nodes of interest. The\nunitaryCAhasc1=cAandc2=cp\nA. Letuandwbe\nthe neighbors of v∈p\\{A,B}on the path. Cvhas\nc1=cvuandc2=cvw, representing a permutation\nbetween the edges (v,u)and(v,w)inp. Finally, the\noperatorCBhasc1=c\n2=cvw, representing a permutation\nbetween the edges (v,u)and(v,w)inp. Finally, the\noperatorCBhasc1=cp\nBandc2=cB. It sufﬁces to set\nKv(t) =IMvin (8) to perform the desired controlled\noperation between aandb, although it is possible to\nperform operations controlled by aon the qubits in the\nintermediate nodes as the walker moves by choosing\nKv(t)accordingly.\nThe overall behavior of the walker is straightforward\nand is illustrated in Figure 2. It is assumed that the\noperatorOdeﬁned in (13) is applied to the system at\nthe beginning of execution. The ﬁrst application of the\ncoin operator in Acreates a superposition between the\nstates|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}htand|A,cp\nA/a\\}bracketri}htthat are entangled with a.\nThe ﬂip-ﬂop shift allows the wavefunction in |A,cp\nA/a\\}bracketri}ht\nto propagate along pand ensures that the |A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht\ncomponent remains in the superposition throughout\nprotocol execution. Each coin ﬂip routes informationon nodes internally, ensuring propagation. The net\neffect of∆(A,B)successive applications of SCis the\nsuperposition speciﬁed in (15).\nD. Separating data and control\nThe state in (15) is an entangled state between\ncontrol and data. This implies that a partial trace\noperation in the walker system does not leave the\nstate ofaandbas it should be if the operation was\nperformed without the walker. In order to overcome\nthis problem, the walker evolution is reversed after\nthe controlled operation takes place by applying the\ninverses of the unitary operators used for propagation.\nSince the coin and shift operators considered are per-\nmutation operators, they are Hermitian unitaries and,\nthus, are their own inverses. It takes ∆(A,B)time\nsteps to reverse the walker back to Aand to transform\nthe joint state of the system to the form\nα|A,cA,0a,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht+β|A,cA,1a,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht. (19)\nIt should be clear that an extended coin operator with\ninteraction of the form given in (7) and a measurement\non the walker produces one of the following separa\naction of the form given in (7) and a measurement\non the walker produces one of the following separable\nstates/braceleftBigg\n|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht⊗(α|0a,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht+β|1a,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht),\n|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht⊗(α|0a,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht−β|1a,Ψb/a\\}bracketri}ht),(20)\nwith equal probability. It is straightforward from the\nseparability between the walker system and the qubits\naandbthat the state after a partial trace operation\nin the walker system is now equivalent to a CNOT\ngate, up to a single-qubit Zgate conditioned on the\nmeasurement outcome.\nNote that moving the walker backwards is only one\nof several ways to achieve a separable state between the\nwalker and the qubits aandb. In a nutshell, any walker\ndynamics that concentrates the walker’s part of the\nwavefunction into a single network node sufﬁces for\nthis purpose, e.g., propagating the walker wavefunction\nfrom bothAandBto an intermediate node. Under the\nassumption of quantum error correction, this backward\npropagation can occur simultaneously with any further\nquantum operation that nodes AandBmay perform\non the qubits and does not impact the latency of the\nprotocol.\nIV. P ROPAGATION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL SIGNALS\nWe demonstrated in the previous section how the\nquantum walk can propagate through a particular path\nof the network connecting nodes AandB. This is\neasily extended to the traversal of multiple paths as we|A,cA/an}bracketri}ht\n|A,cA/an}bracketri}htAvuwB\nz\n(a) Initial state.|A,cA\np/an}bracketri}ht\n|A,cA/an}bracketri}htAvuwB\n(b) Coin in A.|v,cvA/an}bracketri}ht\n|A,cA/an}bracketri}htAvuwB\n(c) Flip-ﬂop shift|v,cvu/an}bracketri}ht\n|A,cA/an}bracketri}htAvuwB\n(d) Coins in path.|B,cp\nB/an}bracketri}ht\n|A,cA/an}bracketri}htAvuwB\n(e) Final state.\nFig. 2: Protocol execution in a 5-by-5grid with a quantum walk through a single path. Dark edges dep ict\nvectors which have non-zero wavefunction component in a giv en step. (a) The initial state of execution is the\nstate generated by the application of the controlle\n step. (a) The initial state of execution is the\nstate generated by the application of the controlled operat ion demonstrated in (13). The node zis shown for\nillustration purposes and is not for propagation. (b) The ﬁr st coin ﬂip permutes the wavefunction into edges\n(A,A)and(A,v). (c) The ﬂip-ﬂop shift exchanges edge (A,u)with edge (u,A), moving the walker while\nmapping the self-loop edge to itself. (d) After the ﬁrst coin ﬂip, all subsequent coin operators work as shift\noperators inside a node, mapping degrees of freedom in order to propel the walker towards B. (e) After ∆(A,B)\nsteps, the ﬁnal wavefunction is a uniform superposition bet ween edges (A,A)and(B,w), which can be used\nto perform an operation controlled by qubit alocated inAwith target qubit blocated inB.\nwill show next. In this setting, kwalkers can be used\nto simultaneously perform operations controlled by a\nwithktarget qubits bjlocated in nodes Bj, forj∈\n{0,...,k−1}. This protocol execution translates to the\nparallel application of k+1one-qubit gates controlled\nbyain terms of distributed quantum computation.\nThe analysis carried for a single walker system\nextends to this case by considering a set of paths P\nsuch that, for every j, the pathpj∈ P connectsAand\nBj. The pathpjdeﬁnes extended coin operators for the\nj-th walker following (18). By carefully choosing the\nqubits controlled by each walker, so that each walker\ninteracts with a unique set of qubits, it is possible\nto routek=|P| walkers concurrently. This is a\ntrivial extension to the single walker case because the\nseparability of individual coins for each walker yield\nthek-walker coin operator for the set of paths Pto be\nof the form\nCP(t) =k−1/circlemultiplydisplay\nj=0Cpj(t). (21)\nSince the memories affected by walker jare unique,\nfor everyj∈ {0,...,T−1}, each walker can be\nseen as a parallel control signal working on distinct\nqubits. Note that, even though the walker evolution is\nperformed by separable extended coin operators andshifts, the appl\nen though the walker evolution is\nperformed by separable extended coin operators andshifts, the application of the controlled operation O\ndescribed in (10) before propagation implies that the\nwalkers are maximally entangled with each other and\nwith qubita. Furthermore, the ﬂip-ﬂop shift operator\nfor each walker does not depend on a particular path\nand the joint operator for all walkers is described by\nSP=k−1/circlemultiplydisplay\nj=0S, (22)\nwithSgiven in (17).\nIn addition to simultaneous 2-qubit control opera-\ntions, it is trivial to use multiple walkers departing\nfromAto perform controlled operations in the nodes\nBj, where the target qubit bjinBjis controlled by\nqubitajinA. The fundamental difference for this case\nis that theOoperator described in (13) is controlled by\nqubitajwhen applied to the j-th walker, generating a\nseparable state among the walkers.\nV. Q UANTUM WALK PROPAGATION AND\nENTANGLEMENT DISTRIBUTION\nAs described previously, the operators deﬁned in\n(7) and (10) allow for universal distributed quantum\ncomputation among nodes of the network. In this sense,\nthe movement of the walker introduces entanglement\nacross nodes. Given this is the case, it is suitable toconsider entanglement distribution protocols in terms\nof the quantum walk control plane. In this section, we\napply the quantum walk control protocol to recover the\nbehavior of two entanglement distribution protocols. In\nparticular, the recovered protocols distribute maximally\nentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeillinger (GHZ) states\nacross network nodes. We demonstrate, for both pro-\ntocols, how the entanglement introduced by the walker\ncan be used to produce the same entangled states.\nSuperposition of the walker wavefunction allows for\nthe creation of a Bell state between aandbas follows.\nAssume that the joint state of the system is at time t\ndescribed by\n|Ψ(t)/a\\}bracketri}ht=1√\n2(|A,cA,0a,0b/a\\}bracketri}ht+|B,cB,0a,0b/a\\}bracketri}ht),(23)\nwhich is a separable state between the walker and the\nqubitsa\ni}ht+|B,cB,0a,0b/a\\}bracketri}ht),(23)\nwhich is a separable state between the walker and the\nqubitsaandb. By settingUV=Xv⊗IandCV(t) =I\nforV∈ {A,B}in (7), the extended coin operator C(t)\nis\nC(t)|Ψ(t)/a\\}bracketri}ht=1√\n2(|A,cA,1a,0b/a\\}bracketri}ht+|B,cB,0a,1b/a\\}bracketri}ht),\n(24)\nwhich is an entangled state between aandb. The\nentanglement between a,b, and the walker system can\nbe removed by transmitting the walker back to Aas\nexplained in Section III-D. Note that only operators of\nthe form prescribed in (7) are needed because there is\nno control dependent on the state of either aorb.\nA GHZ generalizes Bell states to multiple qubits.\nAk-qubit GHZ projection is a von-Neumann mea-\nsurement operation in the GHZ basis and a Bell state\nmeasurement (BSM) is a 2-qubit GHZ projection.\nA. Multi-path entanglement distribution with BSMs\nWe start with the multi-path protocol deﬁned in [25].\nAssuming global link state knowledge is available,\nit sufﬁces to choose the same paths that a complete\nexecution of the multi-path protocol uses to propagate\nentanglement. Assume that P={p0,...,p k−1}is\nthe set of paths used. In this protocol, every path\npjused to distribute entanglement yields a set of\n2(|pj|−1)qubits in a GHZ state, which comes from\nthe net effect of performing |pj| −2BSMs in the\nintermediate nodes. Moreover, the protocol assumes\na network model where every quantum channel in\nthe network is mapped in a one-to-one fashion with\npairs of qubits in the nodes incident to that channel.\nThe logical behavior of this protocol is recovered by\nsending one quantum walker from Athrough each\npathpjsuch that, once it arrives at B, every qubitincident to the quantum channels in the path are in the\nsame GHZ state. Thus, consider that all qubits in the\nnetwork start in the |0/a\\}bracketri}htstate. Initialize kwalkers in\nstate|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht. The operator Cj\nA(0)for thej-th walker\ncan be chosen as any unitary so that\n|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht →1√\n2(|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht+/vextendsingle/vex\ne chosen as any unitary so that\n|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht →1√\n2(|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht+/vextendsingle/vextendsingleA,cpj\nA/angbracketrightbig\n), (25)\nwhile the interaction operator Kj\nA(0)is taken to be\nthe identity operator. The state of the system after the\napplication of the extended operator C(0)is\nC(0)|Ψ(0)/a\\}bracketri}ht=/circlemultiplydisplay\nj1√\n2(|A,cA/a\\}bracketri}ht+|A,cpj\nA/a\\}bracketri}ht).(26)\nProtocol execution is performed by the operators de-\nﬁned in (22) and (21) as speciﬁed in the previous\nsection, although the operators Kvare now deﬁned\nto generate entanglement in the nodes as the walker\npasses by. Let qvj0andqvj1denote the pair of qubits\ninside node v∈pj\\{A,B}that need to be entangled\ntogether by walker j. The operator Uj\nvin equation (8)\nis deﬁned for walker jby specifying\nKv(t) =Xqj0⊗Xqj1/circlemultiplydisplay\nq/ne}ationslash=qvj0,qvj1Iq (27)\nfor allt, performing an Xgate on qubits qj\nv0andqj\nv1\ncontrolled by the position of the j-th walker. Since\npaths are all edge-disjoint, every qubit in the graph\nspanned by Pinteracts with exactly one walker under\nthe application of the generalized coin operator. For\nwalkerj, the interaction operator with qubit ajis given\nby\nKA(t) =/braceleftBigg\nXaj⊗I,whent= 1,\nIaj⊗I,whent/\\e}atio\\slash= 0,(28)\nwhere the identity operator after the tensor product\nsymbol acts on all qubits in Aexceptaj.

Protocols that rely on GHZ projections apply\nentanglement swapping to distribute entanglement be-\ntweenAandB. Entanglement swapping is non-unitary,\nalthough the overall effect of applying a GHZ projec-\ntion is a maximally entangled state between qubits.\nThe quantum walk approach recovers this behavior by\ngenerating GHZ states unitarily. (a) A multi-path BSM\nprotocol is recovered by sending separable walkers into\neach edge-disjoint path used in a round of the protocol,\ndenoted in the ﬁgure by shaded edges. Each path forms\nan independent GHZ state between all qubits in the\npath. (b) The GHZ projection protocol is recovered by\nsending entangled quantum walks to each leaf liof a\nspanning tree of the network rooted in A, represented\nin the ﬁgure by green nodes. All qubits in the network\nare, in this case, in a GHZ state.\nIn this case, Pis formed by two shortest-paths in the\ngrid, i.eK= 2, and the entire evolution of the walkers\ntakes four steps.B. Distributing GHZ states across network nodes\nGHZ projectors are used in [26] to improve the\nmulti-path BSM protocol described in [25]. The logical\nbehavior of the GHZ distribution protocol can be\nrecovered in the quantum walk protocol by slightly\nmodifying the description presented for the multi-path\nBSM protocol. In this protocol, every qubit in a node\nused to distribute entanglement is part of the ﬁnal\nGHZ state achieved. This is in clear contrast with the\nBSM multi-path protocol, where each path deﬁnes an\nindependent GHZ state. The ﬁrst modiﬁcation is that,\ninstead of preparing separable walkers with coins that\nmaps states following the form given in (25), the k\nwalkers need to be entangled in the state\n1√\n2(|A,cA,...,A,c A/a\\}bracketri}ht+/vextendsingle/vextendsingleA,cp0\nA,\n be entangled in the state\n1√\n2(|A,cA,...,A,c A/a\\}bracketri}ht+/vextendsingle/vextendsingleA,cp0\nA,...,A,cpj\nA/angbracketrightbig\n).(30)\nNote that this behavior can be obtained with an inter-\naction operator of the form (10) and a coin operator in\nthe form speciﬁed by (18). Secondly, instead of rout-\ning walkers through edge-disjoint paths, the walkers\ntraverse a tree of the network. More concretely, let T\nbe a spanning tree of the lattice, rooted at A.kis now\nthe number of leaves in TandPis the set of paths in\nthe tree connecting Awith leaves. For any node v, the\ninteraction operator between the walker and the data\nqubits is\nKv=/circlemultiplydisplay\nqvX1\nWvqv, (31)\nwhereWvis the number of walkers that pass through\nv, i.e the number of leaves connected to Abyvin\nthe tree. Note that Kvis the same for every walker.\nThe exponent1\nWvis required because more than one\nwalker may pass through the same vertex, and operate\non the same set of qubits. Since paths are taken from\na spanning tree, each walker can take a particular time\ninterval to traverse its path. Thus, the time necessary\nto entangle all of the necessary qubit in the network\nand remove the entanglement between the walkers\nand the data qubits is on the order of O(maxj|pj|),\nwhere|pj|denotes the hop distance of path pj. Again,\nprotocol execution for the generic GHZ projector case\nis exempliﬁed for a 5-by-5grid in Figure 3(b). In this\ncase,k= 7 and the whole process takes seven time\nsteps to complete, since the size of the largest path in\nthe tree is seven. For nodes u1andu2, the value of W\nis one and three respectively.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nThe quantum walk protocol proposed in this article\nprovides a logical description for a network controlplane capable of performing universal distributed quan-\ntum computing. The description abstracts the imple-\nmentation of the quantum walker system, as well as\nthe implementation of quantum operations in the net-\nwork nodes. We consider that quantum error correction\nyields the ap\nf quantum operations in the net-\nwork nodes. We consider that quantum error correction\nyields the application of perfect unitary operators. The\nkey idea that the protocol builds upon is the use of\na quantum walker system as a quantum control signal\nthat propagates through the network one hop a time. In\nspite of abstracting physical implementations, the prop-\nagation of the walker stipulates latency constraints for\nthe protocol. A generic controlled operation between\na qubit in node Awith a qubit in node Bdemands\nO(∆(A,B))steps of walker evolution. In the con-\ntext of a possible physical realization of such control\nsystem, this latency constraints translates directly to\nthe physical distance between nodes AandB. The\ndescription of the protocol in the logical setting also\nmasks the effects of walker propagation in the ﬁdelity\nof distributed operations. When considering imperfect\noperators, the ﬁdelity of the ﬁnal outcome is bounded\nby the ﬁdelity of the coin and shift operators in the\nquantum walk system. Throughout this manuscript, the\npropagation of a quantum walk across the network\ndepended on a particular path of the network to be\ntraversed. This has the clear requirement that every\nnode in the network knows the network topology\nand that the operators used can be deﬁned by the\nexchange of classical messages between the nodes. The\nprotocol described was used to represent entanglement\ndistribution protocols deﬁned in the literature in terms\nof quantum control information exchanged between the\nnodes in the network. This result highlights connec-\ntions between the proposed protocol and entanglement\ndistribution protocols.\nThere are two clear directions for future work con-\nsidering our results. The ﬁrst relates to the investi-\ngation of a network implementation for a quantum\nwalk system. Such implementation would allow for a\nrealistic characterization of quantities like ﬁdelity and\nlatency. The second point is the description of control\nexclusively with quantum inform\n ﬁdelity and\nlatency. The second point is the description of control\nexclusively with quantum information. In this setting,\nnodes would transmit a quantum state containing both\nthe state of the walker and the target node to which\ncontrol information must be transmitted to.\nAcknowledgments —This research was supported in\npart by the NSF grant CNS-1955834, NSF-ERC Center\nfor Quantum Networks grant EEC-1941583 and by the\nNational Science Foundation to the Computing Re-\nsearch Association for the CIFellows 2020 Program.REFERENCES\n[1] H Jeff Kimble.

Fourth Street, Tucson, Arizona 85719, USA\nNonlinear frequency mixing is of criti-\ncal importance in extending the wavelength\nrange of optical sources [1–3]. It is also in-\ndispensable for emerging applications such as\nquantum information [4, 5] and photonic sig-\nnal processing [6–8]. Conventional lithium\nniobate with periodic poling is the most\nwidely used device for frequency mixing due\nto the strong second-order nonlinearity. The\nrecent development of nanophotonic lithium\nniobate waveguides promises improvements\nof nonlinear efficiencies by orders of magni-\ntudewithsub-wavelengthopticalconferment.\nHowever, theintrinsicnanoscaleinhomogene-\nity in nanophotonic lithium niobate limits the\ncoherent interaction length, leading to low\nnonlinear efficiencies [9–15]. Therefore, the\nperformance of nanophotonic lithium niobate\nwaveguides is still far behind conventional\ncounterparts. Here, we overcome this limita-\ntion and demonstrate ultra-efficient second-\norder nonlinearity in nanophotonic lithium\nniobate waveguides significantly outperform-\ning conventional crystals [16–23]. This is re-\nalized by developing the adapted poling ap-\nproach to eliminate the impact of nanoscale\ninhomogeneity in nanophotonic lithium nio-\nbate waveguides. We realize overall second-\nharmonic efficiency near 104%/W without\ncavity enhancement, which saturates the the-\noretical limit. Phase-matching bandwidths\nand temperature tunability are improved\nthrough dispersion engineering. The ideal\nsquare dependence of the nonlinear efficiency\non the waveguide length is recovered. We\nalso break the trade-off between the energy\nconversion ratio and pump\neguide length is recovered. We\nalso break the trade-off between the energy\nconversion ratio and pump power. A con-\nversion ratio over 80% is achieved in the\nsingle-pass configuration with pump power\nas low as 20 mW. Our work could provide\nhighly scalable and extremely efficient so-lutions for next-generation nonlinear optical\nsources, amplifiers, and converters pivotal for\na wide range of classical and quantum appli-\ncations such as ultra-fast optics and photonic\nquantum networks.\nLithium niobate is one of the most important ma-\nterials for photonics because of the strong second-\norder nonlinearity across a broad transparency win-\ndow [24]. Therefore, it is widely used in diverse\napplications ranging from fiber communications to\nquantum information science [25, 26]. Most pho-\ntonic applications of lithium niobate are based on\nthe electro-optic effect and second-order nonlinear-\noptical processes. Recently, significant efforts have\nbeen devoted to the development of the nanopho-\ntonic lithium niobate platform. The sub-wavelength\nconfinement of optical fields can significantly in-\ncrease the nonlinear strength and enable unique ca-\npabilities for dispersion engineering and large-scale\nintegration [27, 28].\nThe nanophotonic lithium niobate platform has\nachieved remarkable advances in applications based\non the electro-optic effect. Compared with conven-\ntional electro-optic modulators, significant improve-\nmentshavebeendemonstratedinalmostallkeymer-\nits including modulation efficiency, bandwidth, long-\nterm stability, and communication data rate [29–31].\nBesides the performance improvement, nanopho-\ntonic lithium niobate modulators have also been\nused to demonstrate novel photonic functions such\nas optical comb generation, non-reciprocal propaga-\ntion, and quantum transduction [32–34].\nSimilarly, it is expected that the nanophotonic\nlithium niobate platform can also bring revolution-\nized performance for applications based on second-\norder nonlinear-optical processes. P\n revolution-\nized performance for applications based on second-\norder nonlinear-optical processes. Periodically poled\nlithium niobate waveguides have been the stan-\ndard device structure for second-order nonlinear-\noptical processes [16–23].

Unfortu-\nnately, the increase of the nonlinear strength cannot\nbe translated into the improvement of the nonlinear\nefficiency (unit%/W), which directly determines theperformance of nonlinear processes, even after in-\ntense efforts [9–15].\nThe intrinsic nanoscale inhomogeneity in\nnanophotonic lithium niobate limits the coherent\ninteraction length of second-order nonlinear-optical\n2processes to a few millimeters [9–15]. Currently,\nthe maximum demonstrated nonlinear efficiency in\nnanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides is around\n940%/W [14]. With much larger coherent interac-\ntion length, conventional lithium niobate crystals\ncan achieve nonlinear efficiencies 2400%/W in\nspite of smaller nonlinear strength [16]. It remains\nan outstanding question whether nanophotonic\nlithium niobate waveguides can outperform con-\nventional crystals to achieve efficient second-order\nnonlinear-optical processes.\nIt is noteworthy that high-efficiency second-order\nnonlinear processes can be realized in lithium nio-\nbate nanophotonic cavities, since the thickness vari-\nation is small within the length scale of integrated\nphotonic cavities [35]. However, waveguide-based\nsecond-order nonlinear processes can be highly pre-\nferred when large bandwidth, small insertion loss,\nwide tunability, and high power capability are re-\nquired.\nHere we overcome this challenge and demonstrate\nnanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides that out-\nperform conventional crystals in all critical mer-\nits including nonlinear efficiency, power consump-\ntion, optical bandwidth, and wavelength tunabil-\nity. Thesub-wavelengthconfinementofopticalfields\nleads to the increase of the second-order nonlin-\near strength but also causes the significant sen-\nsitivity of the phase-matching condition to struc-\nture variations. For example, a thickness change of\ntivity of the phase-matching condition to struc-\nture variations. For example, a thickness change of\n10 nminthe600-nmlithiumniobatedevicelayercan\ncause a phase-matching wavelength shift over 70 nm\nfor second-harmonic generation (Fig. 1c). Unfortu-\nnately, there is significant thickness variation in the\nnanophotonic lithium niobate device layer caused\nby intrinsic uncertainties during wafer manufac-\nturing including random ion implantation depth\nand non-uniform chemical-mechanical polishing rate\n(Fig. 1d) [36]. Non-ideal nanofabrication conditions\nand poor poling quality further intensify the inho-\nmogeneity. If the standard period poling technique\nis used, second-order nonlinear-optical processes will\naccumulate random phases long the nanophotonic\nwaveguide depending on the local photonic geom-\netry (Fig. 1b). Such random phases prevent the\nconstructiveenhancementofsecond-ordernonlinear-\noptical processes, thus limiting the nonlinear effi-\nciency. The calculated second-harmonic spectrum\nis shown in Fig. 1e (See Methods). Significant devi-\nation from the theoretical sinc-squared function can\nbe observed. Instead of the quadratic increase, thepeak second-harmonic efficiency starts to saturate\nwith device lengths over 3 mm and even decreases at\nlong device lengths (Fig. 1f). Therefore, increasing\nthe device length cannot improve the nonlinear effi-\nciency. Currently, efficient second-order nonlinear-\noptical processes have only been demonstrated in\nnanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides with de-\nvice lengths below 5 mm [9–15].\nTocompensatefortherandomperturbationtothe\nphase-matching condition caused by the nanoscale\ninhomogeneity, we propose the adapted poling ap-\nproach where the poling period is adjusted depend-\ning on the local photonic structure (Fig. 1a). Then,\nideal quasi-phase-matching conditions can be real-\nizedalongtheentirewaveguidedespitethenanoscale\ninhomogeneity (Fig. 1b). No extra optical loss will\nbe introduced as there is no sudden refractive index\nch\neneity (Fig. 1b). No extra optical loss will\nbe introduced as there is no sudden refractive index\nchange. The constructive enhancement at different\nwaveguide sections leads to the quadratic increase of\nthe second-harmonic efficiency with respect to the\ndevice length (Fig. 1f).\nWe use X-cut nanophotonic lithium niobate\nwafers with a 600-nm device layer to fabri-\ncate nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides (See\nMethodsandExtendedDataFig. 1). Thewaveguide\ndirection is aligned with the Y-axis of the lithium\nniobate crystal. We use the fundamental transverse-\nelectric mode for both fundamental and second-\nharmonic fields around 1550 nm and 775 nm respec-\ntively (Insets of Fig. 1c). This allows the use of\nthe largest nonlinear coefficient d33= 19.5pm/V. It\nis noteworthy that the nonlinear coefficient changes\nwith the wavelength [37]. As the accurate measure-\nment of the nonlinear coefficient for lithium niobate\nat1550 nmhasnotbeenperformed, weusethevalue\nmeasured at 1313 nm, which has the smallest wave-\nlength difference with our work [37]. Before fabri-\ncation, we measure the device layer thickness with\nbroadband optical reflectance along the designed\nwaveguide location (Insets of Fig. 1d). Then we pat-\ntern the electrode for ferroelectric domain inversion\nwithdifferentpolingregimelengths(Fig. 2a&b). We\nfabricate two types of nanophotonic lithium niobate\nwaveguides.

Peak efficiencies are also similar\nwith values of 135%/W and 138%/W respectively.\nThisagreeswithpreviousobservationsthatimprove-\nments in the second-order nonlinear-optical perfor-\nmance can be achieved with short waveguides [9–\n15], as the perturbation to the phase-matching con-\ndition caused by the nanoscale inhomogeneity is still\nrelatively small compared with the phase-matching\nbandwidth. However, the situation changes dra-\nmatically with long waveguides. We compare the\n4second-harmonicperformanceof21-mm-longwaveg-\nuides with periodic and adapted poling approaches.\nThe second-harmonic spectrum with periodic pol-\ning deviates significantly from the theoretical sinc-\nsquared function (Fig. 2f). The second-harmonic\nspectrum shows multiple peaks as different waveg-\nuide sections have different phase-matching condi-\ntions. The peak efficiency is measured as 1100%/W,\nwhich is significantly lower than the theoretical limit\nof 10500%/W. Using the measured thickness data,\nwe numerically calculate the second-harmonic spec-\ntrum only considering the local phase-matching con-\ndition change due to the nanoscale inhomogeneity.\nThe strong agreement between calculated and ex-\nperimental results shows that the nanoscale inho-\nmogeneity is the major factor limiting the overall\nsecond-order nonlinear-optical efficiency (Fig. 2f).\nWith the adapted poling approach, the second-\nharmonic spectrum still shows the theoretical sinc-\nsquared function. Compared with the 3-mm-long\nwaveguides, the second-harmonic spectrum shows\nmuchhigherpeakefficiencyandnarrowerbandwidth\n(Fig. 2g). This shows that the nanoscale inhomo-\ngeneity is compensated by the poling period adjust-\nment along the waveguide. We measure peak effi-\nciency as high as 9500 ±1000%/W close to the the-\noretical limit 10500%/W.\nT\n. We measure peak effi-\nciency as high as 9500 ±1000%/W close to the the-\noretical limit 10500%/W.\nThe bandwidth of the second-harmonic gener-\nation is measured as 0.97 nm in the 21-mm-long\nwaveguides, which is twice larger than conventional\nlithium niobate crystals with the same length. This\nis achieved with the smaller group-velocity mis-\nmatch between fundamental and second-harmonic\nfields (164 fs/mm), enabled by the dispersion engi-\nneering capability in nanophotonic lithium niobate\nwaveguides. We further observe that the peak wave-\nlength can be tuned more efficiently in nanophotonic\nlithium niobate waveguides, reaching 0.2 nm/oC\ntemperaturetunabilitywhichisbetterthanthetem-\nperature tunability of conventional lithium niobate\ncrystals (HC Photonics Corp.) 0.15 nm/oC (See\nMethods).\nNext, we measure the peak efficiency dependence\non the waveguide length with both standard peri-\nodicpolingandadaptedpolingapproaches(Fig. 3a).\nFor the periodic poling approach, the peak efficiency\nonly shows a marginal increase at small waveguide\nlengths and saturates at large waveguide lengths.

Here we derive the self-\ncalibrated parameter to characterize the impact of\nthe nanoscale inhomogeneity without requiring ab-\nsolute power and loss calibration (See Methods). We\nfirst integrate the measured second-harmonic effi-\nciency over wavelength to obtain the spectrum area\nA. Then we assume an ideal sinc-squared second-\nharmonic efficiency spectrum with peak efficiency\nη0, and calculate the corresponding spectrum area\nA0which is proportional to the ideal peak efficiency\nη0. As the nanoscale inhomogeneity conserves the\nspectrum area up to the dispersion correction, we\ncan use the measured spectrum area Ato calibrate\nthe ideal spectrum area A0, thus obtaining the ideal\npeak efficiency η0under the same loss condition\nwith the experiment [38]. Then the ratio between\nthe measured raw second-harmonic peak efficiency\n(η) and the ideal peak efficiency ( η0) gives the self-\ncalibrated evaluation of the nanoscale inhomogene-\nity without uncertainties from optical power and\nloss calibration (Fig. 3b). The efficiency ratio for\nthe adapted poling approach stays constant around\nunity for all waveguide lengths, while the efficiency\nratio for the periodic poling approach drops rapidly\nto 0.2 when the waveguide length is beyond 6 mm.\nThe optimized second-harmonic generation al-\nlows us to realize high absolute conversion effi-\nciency with low pump power. Using the 21-mm-\nlong waveguide with adapted poling, we observe the\n\nfi-\nciency with low pump power. Using the 21-mm-\nlong waveguide with adapted poling, we observe the\nonset of pump depletion and second-harmonic sat-\nuration with pump power below 5 mW. We have\nmeasured second-harmonic power of 16.5 mW with\na pump power of 20 mW, corresponding to 82.5%\nabsolute power conversion efficiency (Fig. 3c). By\nfitting the absolute conversion efficiency with the\npump-depletionmodel, weobtaintheoverallsecond-\nharmonic efficiency around 9500 ±500%/W, which\nis consistent with the value measured in the non-\ndepletion region.\nWe further compare our nanophotonic lithium\nniobate waveguides using adapted poling with\nlithium niobate devices using periodic poling in pre-\nvious works. The overall second-harmonic efficiency\nof our device exceeds both the conventional crys-\ntal limit and nanophotonic inhomogeneity limit sig-\nnificantly (Fig. 4a).

We expect that further improve-\nment can be readily made by increasing the length\nof nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides. With\n4-inch nanophotonic lithium niobate wafers, it is\npractical to fabricate nanophotonic lithium niobate\nwaveguides with lengths over 90 mm. Using adapted\npoling, this can lead to second-harmonic efficiency\n6above 2×105%/W without cavity enhancement.\nPumppowerbelow1 mWwillbesufficienttoachieve\nthe same conversion efficiency demonstrated in this\nwork. Even a smaller footprint can be realized by\nusing meandering waveguides.\nIn summary, we present for the first time an\nnanophotonic lithium niobate waveguide with over-\nall second-order nonlinear efficiency beyond the\nnanophotonic inhomogeneous limit and the con-\nventional crystal limit. This is achieved using\nthe adapted poling approach to compensate for\nthe nanoscale inhomogeneity in the nanophotonic\nlithium niobate platform. The capability to real-\nize ultra-high second-order nonlinear efficiency with\nan integrated platform is critical for future photonic\nsystems with strong requirements for low power con-\nsumption and large-scale manufacturing compatibil-\nity. The adapted poling approach can be readily ex-\ntended to other wavelength ranges and second-order\nnonlinear interactions. It can also be\neadily ex-\ntended to other wavelength ranges and second-order\nnonlinear interactions. It can also be used to en-\nhance the Kerr nonlinearity through the cascaded\nsecond-order nonlinear process [39, 40]. Therefore,\nthis work could have a profound impact on a wide\nrange of nonlinear photonic processes such as optical\nparametric oscillation and supercontinuum genera-\ntion in the classical regime, as well as entanglement\ngeneration and quantum frequency conversion in the\nquantum regime. The dramatic performance im-\nprovement of these second-order nonlinear processes\ncould open new opportunities for broad applications\nincluding ultra-short optical pulse generation, the\ninterconnection between diverse quantum systems,\nand all-photonic signal processing.\nAcknowledgments This work is supported in\npart by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office\nof Advanced Scientific Computing Research (Field\nWork Proposal ERKJ355); Office of Naval Research\n(N00014-19-1-2190); NSF-ERC Center for Quantum\nNetworks (EEC-1941583).

After the\nthickness measurement, nickel electrodes are pat-\nterned on top of the lithium niobate device layer.\nThe electrode period is obtained using Extended\nData Fig. 2. The gap between electrodes is 15 µm.\nWe apply 350 V electric pulses with 550 ms dura-\ntion to nickel electrodes for domain inversion. Then\nnickel electrodes are removed by hydrochloric acid.\nElectron-beam lithography is used to define pho-\ntonic waveguides with hydrogen silsesquioxane re-\nsist. Waveguides patterns are aligned in the poling\nregime. Then argon-based plasma is used to transfer\nwaveguide patterns into the lithium niobate device\nlayer (600 nm total thicknesses) with 350 nm etch-\ningdepth. Thewaveguidetopwidthis1.8 µm. SEM\nimage of the fabricated waveguide is shown in Ex-\ntended Data Fig. 1.\nDevice characterization and measurement\nuncertainty\nLight is launched into and collected from the\nwaveguidewithapairoflensedfibers. Acontinuous-\nwave telecom tunable laser is used as the pump.\nThe polarization is controlled by an in-line fiber\npolarization controller. Transmitted fundamental\nand second-harmonic fields are separated with a\nfiber wavelength-division multiplexer, and detected\nwith InGaAs and Si PIN photodetectors respec-\ntively. Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier is used after\nthe telecom laser for high-power measurement, and\na band-pass filter is used to remove the amplified\nspontaneous emission noise.\nThe mean transmission of waveguides is Tf,mean =\n0.085at the fundamental wavelength and Tsh,mean =\n0.040at the second-harmonic wavelength. Fiber-\nwaveguide coupling loss and waveguide propaga-\ntion loss are both included. The propagation loss\nis 0.76 dB/cm at the fundamental wavelength and\n0.69 dB/cm at the second-harmonic wavelength, in-\nferred from on-chip resonator quality factors. With\nfundamental power Pfin the input fiber and second-\n7harmonic power Pshin the output\nty factors. With\nfundamental power Pfin the input fiber and second-\n7harmonic power Pshin the output fiber, the nonlin-\near efficiency for each waveguide is calculated as\nη=Psh√TshTfP2\nf(1)\nThe uncertainty is mainly due to the calibration of\nthe transmissions for both fundamental and second-\nharmonic fields. We estimate the relative uncer-\ntainty of the on-chip input fundamental power is\n∼7%, the uncertainty of the waveguide transmis-\nsion is ∼9%, and the relative uncertainty of the on-\nchip generated second-harmonic power fluctuation\nis∼5%. Following the error propagation rule, we\ncalculated the relative uncertainty of the nonlinear\nefficiency as 12.5%. For the 21-mm-long adapted\npoling waveguide, this leads to ±1000%/W absolute\nuncertainty.\nCalculation of second-harmonic spectrum\nWe use the finite element method to simulate the\neffective reflective index of both the fundamental\nfield and the second-harmonic field with different\nwaveguide thicknesses, and then calculate the cor-\nresponding poling period for the target fundamental\nwavelength λ(Extended Data Fig. 1). Next, we nu-\nmerically solve the second-harmonic generation pro-\ncess in the non-depletion regime. We consider 2N\nsections with alternating second-order nonlinearity\ncoefficient\nχn=χ0(−1)n, n= 1,2, ...,2N (2)\nThe section length Lnis half of the poling period.\nFor the standard periodic poling approach, Lnis\nconstant. For the adapted poling approach, Lnde-\npends on the thickness of the nth section.\nEach section is divided into Mcells with equal\nlengths Ln/M. Therefore, the total number of cells\nis2N·M. With input fundamental wavelength λ,\nthe fundamental and second-harmonic fields in the\nmth cell of the nth section ( Ef\nn,m(λ)andEsh\nn,m(λ))\ncanbecalculatedfromthefieldsinprevioussections.\nEf\nn,m(λ) =Ef\nn,m−1(λ)·exp [ikf\nn,m(λ)Ln/M]\nEsh\nn,m(λ) =Esh\nn,m−1(λ)·exp [iksh\nn,m(λ)Ln/M]\n+χ0(−1)n[Ef\nn,m(λ)]2Ln/M(3)\nEf\nn,1(λ) =Ef\nn−1,M(λ)·exp [ikf\nn,1(λ)Ln/M]\nEsh\nn,1(λ) =Esh\nn−1,M(λ)·exp [iksh\nn,1(λ)Ln/M]\n+χ0(−1)n[Ef\n\nn,1(λ) =Ef\nn−1,M(λ)·exp [ikf\nn,1(λ)Ln/M]\nEsh\nn,1(λ) =Esh\nn−1,M(λ)·exp [iksh\nn,1(λ)Ln/M]\n+χ0(−1)n[Ef\nn,1(λ)]2Ln/M(4)with kf\nn,mandksh\nn,mthe wavevectors for the funda-\nmental and second-harmonic fields respectively. Ini-\ntial conditions are set as\nEf\n1,1(λ) =E0\nEsh\n1,1(λ) =0(5)\nThentheoverallsecond-harmonicefficiencyatwave-\nlength λis given by\nη(λ)∝\f\fEsh\nN,M(λ)\f\f2/|E0|4(6)\nIn this calculation, we assume low pump power\ntherefore the second-harmonic generation is in a\nnon-depletion regime. We also ignore the change of\nthesecond-ordernonlinearcoefficient( χ0)duetothe\noptical mode size. Therefore, only the local phase-\nmatching condition change due to the nanoscale in-\nhomogeneity is included.\nSelf-calibrated second-harmonic generation\nperformance\nThe area of the second-harmonic efficiency spec-\ntrum is calculated as\nA=Z\nη(λ)dλ (7)\nwhere η(λ)is the measured second-harmonic ef-\nficiency. The measured peak efficiency is η=\nmax[η(λ)]. We can also calculate the spectrum area\nassuming the ideal phase-matching condition along\nthe entire waveguide [38]\nA0=αη0/L (8)\nwhere η0is the peak efficiency for the ideal second-\nharmonic spectrum and α= 2π(d∆k/dλ )−1is the\ndispersion factor with ∆kthe wavevector mismatch\nbetween fundamental and second-harmonic fields.\nUnder the same loss condition, the spectrum area\nis conserved under inhomogeneous broadening [38].\nA=A0 (9)\nTherefore, we can get the ideal peak efficiency η0un-\nderthesamelosscondition,butwiththeidealphase-\nmatching condition along the entire waveguide.\nη0=AL/α (10)\nThen we can have the self-calibrated efficiency ratio\n8between the measured and ideal peak efficiencies\nR=η\nη0=ηα\nAL(11)\nAssuming uncalibrated extra losses t1andt2for\nthe input fundamental and output second-harmonic\nfields respectively, we have\nη\nA=η′t2t−2\n1R\nη′(λ)t2t−2\n1dλ=η′\nA′(12)\nwhere η′andA′are the second-harmonic efficiency\nand spectrum area with perfect loss calibration.\nEq. (12) shows that the efficiency ratio Ris inde-\npendent of loss and power calibrat\ns calibration.\nEq. (12) shows that the efficiency ratio Ris inde-\npendent of loss and power calibration.\nUsing the ideal peak efficiency η0(Eq. 10), we can\nalso obtain the intrinsic normalized efficiency with-\nout the impact of nanoscale inhomogeneity\nη0,norm =η0/L2=A/Lα (13)\nThe average intrinsic normalized efficiency across all\nwaveguides is 2044 ±150%/W/cm2. This value is\nslightly smaller than the theoretical normalized effi-\nciency 2388%/W/cm2mainly due to the deviation\nof poling duty cycles from 50%.\nTemperature tunability\nThe phase-matching condition can be written as\nπ\nΛ=2π(n2−n1)\nλ(14)\nwhere the poling period Λdepends on temperature\nTdue to thermal expansion, and fundamental and\nsecond-harmonic effective refractive indices ( n1and\nn2) depend both on the temperature Tand wave-\nlength λ. By differentiating Eq. (14), we obtain the\ntemperature tunability\ndλ\ndT=∂Λ\n∂T(n2−n1) + (∂n2\n∂T−∂n1\n∂T)Λ\n1\n2−(∂n2\n∂λ−∂n1\n∂λ)Λ(15)\nThe simulated temperature tunability of nanopho-\ntonic lithium niobate waveguides is 0.34 nm/oC, in\ncontrast to 0.13 nm/oC for conventional lithium nio-\nbate. This is mainly attributed to dispersion con-\ntrol. Instead of a constant negative dispersion value\nin conventional lithium niobate ( (∂n2\n∂λ−∂n1\n∂λ)Λ =\n−0.608), integrate waveguides show positive disper-\nsion value ( (∂n2\n∂λ−∂n1\n∂λ)Λ = 0 .363), boosting the tem-\nperature tunability (Extended Data Fig. 3 and 4).∗lfan@optics.arizona.edu\n[1] A.

Diamond, as a host to atom -like defects with optically -accessible spin qubits, is a leading platform to realize quantum memory \nnodes needed to extend the reach of quantum links. Photonic crystal (PhC) cavities enhance light -matter \ninteraction and are essential ingredients of an efficient interface between spins and photons th at are used to \nstore and communicate quantum information respectively. Despite great effort, however, the realization of \nvisible PhC cavities with high quality factor (Q) and design flexibility is challenging in diamond. Here, we \ndemonstrate one - and two- dimensional PhC cavities fabricated in recently developed thin- film diamonds, \nfeaturing Q -factors of 1.8x10\n5 and 1.6x105, respectively, the highest Qs for visible PhC cavities realized in \nany material. Importantly, our fabrication process is simple and high- yield, based on conventional planar \nfabrication techniques, in contrast to previous approaches that rely on complex undercut methods. We also \ndemonstrate fibe\n in contrast to previous approaches that rely on complex undercut methods. We also \ndemonstrate fiber -coupled 1D PhC cavities with high photon extraction efficiency, and optical coupling \nbetween a single SiV center and such a cavity at 4K achieving a Purcell factor of 13. The demonstrated \ndiamond thin- film photonic platform will improve the performance and scalability of quantum nodes and \nexpand the range of quantum technologies.  \n \n \n \nIntroduction  \nDiamond, as a host to atom -like defects with optically accessible long -lived spin qubits, has emerged as  a \ncompelling platform for applications in quantum sensing1–4 and communication5–8. Among diamond color \ncenters, nitrogen vacancies (NV)1–5, silicon vacancies (SiV)6,7,9–11, and tin vacancies (SnV)8,12–14 are \nparticularly promising, and have enabled many state -of-the-art demonstrations of quantum communication. \nFundamentally, practical quantum communication requires fast and low -loss transfer of quantum \ninformation between spins (stationary qubit/quantum m emory) and photons (flying qubit), which translates \nto figures of merit like bandwidth and fidelity. Therefore, achieving efficient spin- photon interfaces is \ncrucial for a wide range of applications. In diamond, these interfaces have been realized by embedding the \nemitters within optical structures, including microcavities15, microrings/microdisks16, waveguides8,11,17, and \nnanophotonic cavities6,9,12,13,18,19, which have been enabled by steady progress in diamond fabrication \ntechniques. Among all structures, photonic crystal (PhC) cavities are one of the most efficient spin -photon \ninterfaces because they support optical modes with high quality factors (Q) and small mode volumes (V), which greatly enhances light -matter interactions and allow for efficient control and readout of the emitter \nspin state. As a result, PhC cavities have been utilized in a diverse range of qubit platforms, including \nquantum dots20, defects in Si or SiC21–23, and\nzed in a diverse range of qubit platforms, including \nquantum dots20, defects in Si or SiC21–23, and rare -earth ions in host materials 24–26. \nSeveral methods have been developed to fabricate diamond nanophotonic structures from bulk diamond substrates, including the focused- ion-beam (FIB) milling\n19, Faraday -cage angled etching27, and approaches \nbased on reactive- ion-beam (RIE) angled etching6,9 (Figure 1a) or quasi -isotropic etching12,13,18 (Figure 1b). \nBoth angled and quasi -isotropic etching are the state -of-the-art methods and most popular as a result. \nHowever, despite great efforts, these methods typically result in visible PhC cavities with Q factors up to the low ~10\n4 range, much lower than the simulated values \u003E106, likely limited by fabrication imperfections \nsuch as roughness of etched surfaces induced by complex undercutting processes28. In parallel, diamond \nthin films generated by substrate thinning and ion- slicing followed by regrowth are explored as the tried -\nand true method, due to their potential to simplify and improve fabrication by eliminating undercutting. \nHowever, the PhC cavit y Qs fabricated using these approaches have been limited to ~103, due to thickness \nvariation and imperfect diamond crystal quality29–31. They are usually incompatible with quantum \nnetworking demonstrations for practicle reasons, so the bulk machining methods are still the work horse in \nthe quantum diamond photonics community today. Therefore, a new thin- film platform and fabrication \npathw ay that improve fabrication capability and maintain high diamond quality are needed to enhance the \nperformance of photonic components in diamond.  \n \nFig 1. State -of-art high -Q suspended PhC cavities fabrication methods.  (a) Angled etch of a 1D PhC \ncavity. The structure has a characteristic triangular cross section due to the nature of the fabrication process. Due to the shallow angle of the ion beam which would graze the top edge of nearby structures, \ndense pa\n to the shallow angle of the ion beam which would graze the top edge of nearby structures, \ndense patterns are prohibited.  (b) Quasi -isotropic etch of a 1D PhC cavity. The suspension is achieved by \nan isotropic O\n2 reactive- ion etch process. The disadvantage of this method is long undercutting ti me that \nscales with beam width. In both (a) and (b), the structure is carved out of a bulk diamond, and usually has visible artifacts/roughness on the bottom of the nanobeam due to the undercutting.  (c) This work: thin \nfilm fabrication of 1D and 2D PhC ca vities. This approach relies on top- down etching and undercutting of \nthe handle substrate, so it simplifies the fabrication and avoids the roughness of the bottom surface. As a \nresult, this approach leads to exceedingly higher Qs and also allows for more v ersatile photonic circuits to \nbe realized.   \nIn this paper, we demonstrate a new thin film diamond photonic platform and realize optical cavities in the \nvisible wavelength range featuring record -high Q factors coupled to stable SiV centers. In our approach, \nwe use a high -quality and homogenous thin film diamond bonded to a silicon oxide/silicon handle wafer. \nThe film is created through ion implantation in bulk diamond, regrowth, electrochemical etching, and \ntransfer printing32. We design and fabricate 1D and 2D PhC diamond cavities operating at 737 nm \nwavelength range and measure a Q -factor up to 1.8x105, a record for visible PhC cavities fabricated in any \nmaterial (Table 1). We also fabricate 1D PhCs critically coupled to a feeding waveguide and measure loaded Q of 8.4x10\n4 (intrinsic Q ~ 1.8x105 ) and a waveguide -cavity coupling efficiency of ~ 65%. We show that \nthis fabrication method exhibits high- yield and uniformity: 93% (53 out of 57) of the cavities feature high-\nQ modes with resonances matched closely to the designed resonances. Finally, we  demonstrate coupling of \nimplanted SiVs to fabricated diamo nd cavities and observe three -fold re\n  demonstrate coupling of \nimplanted SiVs to fabricated diamo nd cavities and observe three -fold reduction of their radiative lifetime, \nachieving a Purcell factor of 13. We expect the exceptional cavity performance, high -yield fabrication \nprocess, and excellent SiV properties of this new platform to further advance t he field of quantum photonics, \nas efficient spin -photon interfaces for color centers in diamond and beyond.  \n \nResult  \nDevice fabrication  \nIn our approach, we begin by generating diamond thin films by ion slicing and overgrowth and then use a \ntransfer printing process to directly bond the thin films to a SiO2/Si substrate32. The size and thickness of \nthe diamond film are ~200x200 um and 160 nm, respectively. The film has a surface roughness \u003C 0.3nm \nand thickness variation ~1 nm, both essential for minimizing optical scattering losses and achieving uniform, high- Q cavities. T he SiVs are generated through implantation across the membrane before the \ntransfer, resulting in randomly distributed SiVs. The fabrication process used to realize PhCs in diamond \nthin films is summarized in  Fig. 2 (a). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of fabricated 1D and \n2D PhC cavities are shown in Fig. 2 (b) and (c). The 1D cavities (lattice constant a\n1D = 184~226 nm and \nhole radius r 1d = 65 nm) are formed by introducing a quadratic hole shift near the waveguide center12, while \nthe 2D cavities ( a2D = 236~269 nm and r 2d = 65 nm) are formed by shifting the center holes outwards in the \nPhC line -defect waveguide29. The details of 1D and 2D cavity designs and resulting field profiles can be \nfound in Methods. The typical simulated Q and V for our 1D (2D) cavities are ~1.0x106 (~7.6x105) and \n~0.5 (~2.9) (λ/n)3 . \n For practical applications it is important to interface the cavity with a waveguide and eventually a fiber to \nefficiently transfer quantum information between local spins and propagating photons . Therefore, we also \nfabricate 1D PhC coupl\ninformation between local spins and propagating photons . Therefore, we also \nfabricate 1D PhC coupled to a feeding wa veguide Fig. 2(e) by reducing the number of holes in the photonic \ncrystal mirror on one side of the waveguide (see Methods). This results in the light preferentially coupling \nout of the cavity from the feeding waveguide and leading to a simulated cavity Q of 1.9x10\n5 (for a = 255 \nnm). The waveguide is tapered at the end (\u003C 60 nm tip width) to allow efficient coupling to a tapered fiber \n33,34.  \n \n  \nFig. 2: Fabrication of high- Q PhC cavities on a thin- film diamond membrane. (a) Fabrication flow of \nthe devices based on a thin -flim diamond platform. : (1) The diamond with implanted SiV is bonded to the \nSiO2/Si substrate; (2) A liftoff of Cr/Au metal stack is performed to define a “frame” around the film in \norder to secure it on the carrier chip; (3) a silicon nitride (SiN) hard mask is deposited using plasma -\nenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with electron beam (EB) resist ZEP520A on top; (4) The  \ncavity pattern is written using EB lithography, and is transferred onto the SiN hard mask using plasma \nreactive ion etching (RIE) in SF 6 and H 2 chemistry; (5)After removing the EB resist, the pattern is etched \ninto diamond using RIE in O 2 chemistry; (6) Finally, hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used to remove the SiN \nmask and the 1- um oxide sacrificial layer underneath. To introduce additional separation between diamond \nfilm and underlying substrate, the handle wafer is exposed to XeF 2 to etch a deep trench (\u003E 1u m) under the \nmembrane to avoid optical losses via coupling between the diamond membrane and silicon substrate .

The geometry is formed by removing 9 holes on the one side from the symmetric 1D cavity design to allow for more preferential coupling to the tapered- waveguide side of the structure.  \n \n \n \nDevice characterization: 1D and 2D photonic crystal  \nThe fabricated devices are first characterized by photoluminescence (PL) measurements at room \ntemperature (see Method). Figures 3 (a) and (b) show the PL spectra measured for 1D and 2D PhC cavities \nwith different lattice constants, a1D/2D. The broad peak at 737 nm is the emission of SiV centers. For 1D \nPhC cavities, we observe sharp peaks corresponding to the fundamental and high- order (2nd and 3rd) \nmodes.  A clear red -shift of their resonant wavelengths is observed as the values of a  increase. The measured \nwavelengths of fundamental modes are in good agreement with the simulations (see the upper panel of Fig. \n3 (c)). 2D PhC cavities also exhibit peaks corresponding to the band edges and fundamental modes, and \nshow shift of the cavity wavel engths as a becomes larger, which is consistent with the simulation as well \n(see the lower panel of Fig. 3 (c)).  \n This fabrication method exhibits high uniformity (resonances close to simulation) and high- yield (high- Q \nmodes) for both 1D and 2D PhC cavities: from Fig. 3 (c), we estimate the deviation of the measured wavelengths from the simulation to be within 2.9% an d 2.5% for 1D and 2D cavities, respectively. We fit \nthe cavity spectra observed in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) find that 100% (30 out of 30) of all 1D cavities and 85% (23 out of 27) of all  2D cavities characterized feature spectrometer -limited quality factors of  Q  \u003E ~2x10\n4.  \n   \n \nFig. 3: Lattice constant dependence of 1D and 2D PhC cavities:  Off-resonance excitation and \nspectrometer \n Lattice constant dependence of 1D and 2D PhC cavities:  Off-resonance excitation and \nspectrometer characterization of (a) 1D and (b) 2D phCs.

(c) The measured cavity  resonances \n(fundamental mode) versus the designed ones for 1D, 1D with taper, and 2D PhC cavities presented in this \npaper. We observe excellent agreement between the two.  \n \nTo further resolve the high- Q cavity resonances, we perform cross- polarized measurements using a tunable \nCW laser29, as schematically shown in Fig. 4 (a). We scan the laser across the cavity resonance and detect \nthe scattered light from the sample by an avalanche photodiode (APD). Figures 4 (c) and (d) show the \nreflection spectra of the fundamental cavity modes measured for 1D and 2D cavities with the highest Q \nfactors. The peaks are fitted to a Lorentizian function, and the Q factors obtained are 1.83x105 and 1.60x105, \nrespectively. We note that the Q value for 1D PhC device is one order of magnitude higher than those \npreviously reported in visible diamond PhC cavities, setting a new record for visible PhC cavities fabricated in any material (Table 1). Furthermore, our  method is compatible with fabrication of state -of-the-art 2D \nPhC cavities in diamond that are difficul t to make using bulk machining approaches or previous thin film \ndiamond approaches: we demonstrate 2D PhC devices with Q factors that are 20~100 times higher than those shown before (Table 1). Lastly, most measured 1D and 2D cavities on the same membrane e xhibit Q \nfactors over 0.5x10\n5  as shown in Fig. 4 (f). which further showcases the uniformity and yield of this \nplatform.  \n \nFurthermore, our method is c\nwhich further showcases the uniformity and yield of this \nplatform.  \n \nFurthermore, our method is compatible with fabrication of state -of-the-art 2D PhC cavities in diamond that \nare difficult to make using bulk machining approaches or previous thin film diamond approaches: The \nhighest Q factor achieved in the 2D PhC device is  also we demonstrate 2D PhC devices with Q factors that \nare 20~100 times higher than previous values reported using quasi -isotropic etching and thin film based \napproach those shown before (Table 1), suggesting the usefulness of our platform for the realiza tion of high \nexperimental Q factors. Lastly, most measured 1D and 2D cavities on the same membrane exhibit Q factors over 5x10\n4  as shown in Fig. 4 (f). which further showcases the uniformity and yield of this platform.  \n \nTo characterize the 1D PhC cavities coupled to a waveguide, we use an optical fiber coupling system, as \nshown in Fig. 4 (b). The light from the tunable laser is sent to the tapered waveguide through the optical \nfiber and the reflected light is detected by an APD. We use a low laser power of ~pW to avoid distortion of \nthe cavity spectrum due to the thermo- optic effect (see Methods).  Fig. 4 (e) shows the cavity spectrum of \nwaveguide -coupled 1D PhC cavity with the highest Q factor. The loaded Q factor is meas ured to be 8.4x104. \nThe cavity dip shows full contrast (95.3±0.3 % contrast), indicating that our cavity is almost critically \ncoupled. This allows us to estimate the intrinsic Q to be  Qi = (1.8±0.4)x105. The coupling efficiency \nbetween the cavity and the waveguide is measured to be η c ~ 65% in our system (see Methods).  \n  \nFig. 4: 1D and 2D PhC cavity on -resonance characterizations for measuring quality factors: (a) The \ncross -polarization setup for on- resonance characterization of the cavity.

The values from \nthis work are plotted along with the highest literature values in their respective categories, as shown in \nTable 1.  \n \n \nCharacterization of SiV  properties  \nStable and bright emitters are required for cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) experiments. To \ndemonstrate the immediate compatibility of this platform for efficient photonic interface for emitters \nembedded in diamond, we characterize the SiVs in the fab ricated devices at 4K and demonstrate optical \ncoupling between an SiV and a high- Q 1D PhC cavity.  \n \nWe optically characterize two single SiV centers embedded in the realized high -Q cavities by confocal PL \nmeasurements at 4K, as shown in Fig 5. (a). The spectrum of an SiV at 4K features four optical transitions labeled from A to D around 737 nm, as shown in Fig 5. (b). We first characterize the C transition of a single SiV at 737.09 nm. Figure 5 (d) shows the color map of its photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra \nmeasured over two hours (upper panel) and a single scan spectrum (lower panel). There is no significant \nspectral diffusion and the linewidth is fitted to be 605 MHz. The observed linewidth is slightly larger than \nthe typical value of ion -implanted SiV− centers35, possibly due to the laser broadening or/and \nmembrane/cavity fabrication36. We then perform the second -order correlation  (g2(𝜏𝜏)) measurements using \na Hanbury Brown- Tw\nn36. We then perform the second -order correlation  (g2(𝜏𝜏)) measurements using \na Hanbury Brown- Twiss setup (see Methods). The measured intensity correlation histogram (Fig. 5 (c)) \nexhibits a clear antibunching with a value of the zero time delay g2(0)  of 0.31±0.12, confirming the single -\nphoton nature of the investigated SiV. The non- zero value of g2(0) could be due to dark counts of the APD, \ndrift of the sample position, and diffusion of the ZPL line over a long time.  \n \nWe finally investigate the optical coupling between a single SiV center and a 1D cavity in our thin film \ndiamond platform. We choose a cavity device with measured resonance at 737.5 nm and experimental Q \nof 1.2x105. The measured PL spectra of the cavity device features four sharp peaks, corresponding to A ~ \nD transitions of an SiV, and the cavity resonance which is gradually tuned to the D line using a gas \ncondensation approach12(Fig. 5 (e)). The SiV experiences low strain, indicated by the ~55 GHz splitting \nbetween C and D line37. We observe small shifts of the D line during the tuning, which could indicate \nchanges in strain environment. It is noted that the linewidth of the cavity spectra shown is limited by our \nspectrometer resolution of ~10 GHz. Under the resonance condition (s pectral detuning between the D line \nand cavity of Δ ~ 0 nm, red spectrum in Fig. 5(e)), we observe a ~20- fold intensity enhancement of the D \nline emission compared to that under far -detuned conditions ( Δ ~ 0.4 nm, blue spectrum in Fig. 5(e)), \nsuggesting that the spontaneous emission rates of the SiV center are enhanced by Purcell effect.  \n \nWe also conduct time- resolved PL measurements on the same SiV  center (see Method). Figure 5 (f) shows \nthe PL curves measured under the resonance (red) and far -detuned condition (blue). By fitting the curves \nwith a single exponential function, we obtain the lifetime of the SiV on resonance ( 𝜏𝜏on) to be 0.47 ± 0.006 \nns, which is reduced approximately by a f\nfetime of the SiV on resonance ( 𝜏𝜏on) to be 0.47 ± 0.006 \nns, which is reduced approximately by a factor of 3 from the off -resonance value ( 𝜏𝜏off) of 1.3 ± 0.01 ns. The \nPurcell factor of the investigated zero -phonon line (ZPL) FZPL is estimated to be 13 (see Methods). This \nvalue is much smaller than the theoretical Purcell factor (see Methods), likely due to the large displacement \nof SiV position with respect to the cavity field maximum as a result of random bulk implantation. To further \nimprove the Purcell factor, the SiVs can be implanted at the cavity region usi ng the well -established masked \nimplantation technique6,7. We estimate that for SiV mask -implanted at the cavity regions, the cooperativity \nC, an important figure -of-merit for evaluating the emitter -cavity coupled system, could reach \u003E 960 \n(undercoupled, Q ~ 1.8x105) or \u003E 440 (critically coupled, Q ~ 8.4x104) with experimental values (see \nMethods), which are 9 or 4 times higher than the highest value reported in a previous work6.  The realization \nof such a large C  as a result of the high -Q cavity is highly advantageous for high fidelity of control of the \nspin/nuclear states and networking applications.   \n \n  \nFig. 5: SiV characterization and its optical coupling to the PhC cavity at 4 K:  (a) An illustration of SiV \nplaced close to the center of PhC cavity (SEM image).

We achieved \nQ factors up to 1.8x105, which is a record high in visible -wavelength PhC cavities in any materials. We \nalso fabricated high- Q 2D PhC cavities that were previously challenging using conventional diamond bulk \nmachining approaches, and also achieved record -high Q values up to 1.6x105. Finally, of interest for \npractical applications and demonstrations of efficient spin -photon interface, we demonstrated waveguid e-\ncoupled 1D PhD cavities featuring intrinsic (loaded) Q up to 1.8x105 (8.3x104) and coupling efficiency of \n65%. The significant improvement of the experimental Q factors in this work can be attributed to the use \nof a high- optical- quality thin film diamond membrane with a smooth surface roughness \u003C 0.3nm and small \nthickness variation ~1 nm 32. Still, Qs are one order of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions, \nindicating that there is room for improvement. The difference could be due to surface absorption38 and/or \noptical scatterings due to fabrication imperfections such as lithography error of the air holes in position or \nradius, surface roughness, sidewall roughness/tilt of air holes39. \n \nLastly, we demonstrated optical coupling between the realized high Q  cavity and a single SiV, with \nmeasured Purcell factor of 13, and therefore the immediate compatibility of this platform with color -center \ncavity QED. Us\nof 13, and therefore the immediate compatibility of this platform with color -center \ncavity QED. Using masked implantation, better overlap between SiV and optical mode can be achieved, \nresulting in cooperativities \u003E 440.  The lower loss and design flexibility in this platform can fundamentally \nenhance color -center -based technologies, by allowing for higher single photon rates, higher gat e fidelities, \nmore integrated functionalities, etc. In combination with the robust, high uniformity, and high- yield \nfabrication process, our thin- film diamond platform will hopefully unlock new opportunities for color -\ncenter applications for quantum inform ation.  \n Our platform and fabrication approach based on a thin- film diamond can be applied to a variety of other \nmicro/nanostructures that are important in diamond integrated photonic applications such as nonlinear \nphotonics\n40,41 and diamond phononics42,43.  Additionally, the flexibility of direct bonding makes this \napproach easily applicable to other substrates besides Si/SiO 232, which enables the heterogeneous \nintegration of the diamond platform containing color centers onto existing and emerging integrated photonic \ncircuits for quantum networks, including thin- film lithium niobate11, aluminum nitride10, and CMOS -\ncompatible platforms44.  \n \n \n \n \nCavity type,  \nmaterial  Wavelength \n(nm)  Q V \n(λ/n)3 Method  Reference  \n1D, diamond  737 8.3x104/1.8x105 0.5 Thin film  This work  \n1D, diamond  637 1.4x104 ~1 Quasi -isotropic etching  Mouradian18 \n1D, diamond  737 2.0x104 0.5 Angle etching  Bhaskar6 \n1D, diamond  660 2.4x104 0.5 Photoelectrochemical \netching  Lee31 \n1D, diamond  1529 (telecom)  1.8x105/2.7x105 0.57 Angle etching  Burek42 \n1D, SiN  780 1.1x105 0.4 Thin film  Samutpraphoot45  \n1D, AlN  403 6.9x103 1.6 Thin film  Sergent46 \n1D, 4H -SiC 700 7x103 0.5 Photoelectrochemical \netching  Bracher47 \n1D, GaP  744 3.0x104 ~1 Monolithic  Chakravarthi48 \n1D, InGaP  841 2.1x104 0.64 Monolithic  Saber49 \n2D, d\nP  744 3.0x104 ~1 Monolithic  Chakravarthi48 \n1D, InGaP  841 2.1x104 0.64 Monolithic  Saber49 \n2D, diamond  746 1.6x105 2.18 Thin film  This work  2D, diamond  645 8x103 0.35 Fib Jung19 \n2D, diamond  1470 (telecom)  1.8x103 2.15 Thin film  Kuruma29 \nTable 1 : Visible and telecom wavelength suspended diamond PhCs, and visible wavelength \nsuspended PhCs in other low loss visible photonic materials.  \n \n \nMethod   \nDevice design  \nThe 1D and 2D PhCs  in this paper are simulated using  a 3D finite -difference time- domain (FDTD) method. \nThey share the same geometry as in a previous work12.  Fig. S1 (a) and (b) show the mode profile and the \ngeometry of the cavity region of the 1D PhC cavity. Fig. S1 (a) inset shows the mode profile of the 1D PhC  \ndevice coupled to a feeding waveguide. The free -standing diamond nanobeam is designed to be 370 nm \nwide (w), and 160 nm thick (d). For the mirror cells, we scan the lattice constant a from 226 nm to 284 nm, \nto cover a wide range of target wavelength from 680 nm to 800 nm of the cavity. The airhole radius (r) is 65 nm. To form the cavity, we taper the lattice constant at the center quadratically, with a\n1 = 0.84a , a2 = \n0.844a, a3 = 0.858a, a4 = 0.88a, a5 = 0.911a, a6 = 0.951 a. Fig. 1 (b) shows the electric field profile (E y) of \nthe fundamental mode of the cavity with a = 269 nm. The simulated Q is 1.3 x 106, with a mode volume of \nV ~ 0.5( λ/n)3. The waveguide -coupled devices are designed by removing 9 holes from one side of the 1D \nPhC device. The holes that form the cavities have the same dimensions. When a is set to be 255 nm for the \ndevices with tapered waveguides, the simulated Q is 1.9 x 105, with a mode volume of V ~ 0.5( λ/n)3. The \ncoupling efficiency between the cavity and diamond waveguide η c is simulated to be ~87% by FDTD \nsimulations.  \n Fig. S1 (c) and (d) show the mode profile and the geometry of the cavity region of the 2D photonic crystal. The cavity is created by the local width modulation of a li\navity region of the 2D photonic crystal. The cavity is created by the local width modulation of a line defect. The lattice is triangular, where the \nlattice constant (a) ranges from 236 nm t o 269 nm to target wavelength from 677 to 767 nm, and the hole \nradius (r) is also 65 nm. By keeping the air hole size constant across a given chip, we can minimize \nsystematic distortion in the hole sizes in fabrication. The cavity is formed by removing shi fting the central \nholes “outwards” towards the mirror region in a linear fashion, where b\n1 = 10.1 nm,  b 2 = 0.75b 1 , b3 = 0.5 b1 \n, b4 = 0.25b 1. Fig. 1 (d) shows the electric field profile (E y) of the fundamental mode of the cavity with a = \n252 nm. The simulated Q is 6.3 x 106, with a mode volume of V = 2.9 (λ/n)3  \nExtended data Fig. 1 (a) 1D  phC mode profile (E y).  The field is normalized. (b) 1D phC design. The \ncavity is formed by tapering the lattice constant quadratically, a 1  to a 6. (c) 2D  phC mode profile (E y). (d) \n2D phC design. The cavity is formed by shifting the holes, by b 1  to b 4.  \n \n \n \nMeasurement setup  \nConfocal photoluminescence measurements   \nIn Fig.3, both spectra for 1D and 2D devices are measured using a commercial spectrometer system with \nfree-space off -resonance excitation and collection. A green diode laser (523 nm) is used to scatter off of the \ncavities via an objective (x100), and the scatter light is sent through a 1800 gr/mm grating and collected by \na Si CCD camera cooled to 4K.  The spectrometer used is SpectraPro HRS -750, the supercontinuum laser \nis SuperK EXTREME.  \n \nCross -polarized measurements  \nIn Fig. 4, the visible scanning laser is M Squared, which can stabilize in 710- 790 nm, and the APD is \nSPCM -AGRH- 14-FC from Perkin Elmer.  For these measurements, the input polarizer is aligned to the \ncavity polarization (TE), the half -wave plate is set to 23.5° so that the laser polarization is 45° relative to \nthe cavity polarization, and the output polarization is s\nthe laser polarization is 45° relative to \nthe cavity polarization, and the output polarization is set to be perpendicular to the cavit y polarization. The \nworking principle behind the measurement is that the cavity acts as a polarization filter when the incident light is resonant with the cavity. As such, off -resonant light is fully blocked by the cross polarization \nbetween P1 and P2, but  light resonant with the cavity has a non- zero polarization component in the direction \nof P2, resulting in a Lorentzian peak in reflection corresponding to the cavity resonance.  \n \nFiber- coupling measurements  \nThe waveguide -coupled 1D PhC cavities are measured via fiber -coupled reflection measurements (shown \nin Figure 4 e). These measurements are performed by inputting light from a tunable laser (M Squared) into \nthe diamond waveguide via a tapered optical fiber (S630 HP)33 and measuring the reflected light from the \noptical cavity. We can estimate the degree of over/under coupling via the depth of the cavity reflection dip \n𝑅𝑅0 via the formula 𝜅𝜅 𝑖𝑖=𝜅𝜅(1± 𝑅𝑅0) \n2 where the plus (minus) refers to the cavity being over (under) coupled. \nFor the cavities, where 𝑅𝑅0 is close 0, this is a signature of the cavities being near -critically -coupled ( κe ~ κi). \nFor the fitted 95.4% contrast, the Q i and Q e are estimated to be 1.4x105 and 2.2x105, interchangeably.  \n \nIn order to calculate coupling efficiency, it is necessary to decouple setup -related losses from losses related \nto the fiber -device coupling interface. We can express this mathematically by writing the total loss from \nD1 to D2 ( ηtot) as a product of these losses, i.e. ηtot = ηsηc2.  To find η s, we splice a retroreflector into the \nsetup at port 2, such that the loss from D1 to D2 can be solely attributed to setup losses  ηs. Once this is \ncalibrated, we can attribute any excess losses in the device measurement as fiber -device coupling losses.  \n \n \nExtended data Fig. 2  Q measurement summary.

(b) A summary of the Qs obtained from on -resonance laser scans \nfor all devices on the sample, compared with the highest literature Q factors in diamond 1D and 2D PhC.  \n \n \nTo confirm that the peaks are not broadened or narrowed because of thermo- optics caused by the laser sent \ninto the cavity, we scanned both forward and backward with the same scanning speed and laser power. The \nfitted Q is between 7.8~9.1x104, as shown in Fig. S3 (a). \n \nWe can resolve the devices with resonances reachable by the scanning laser, in the range of 710 -790 nm. \nThey are plotted in Fig. S2 (b) against literature values presented in Table 1, which is an extended version of Fig. 4. (g) in the main.  \n \nCalculating Purcell Factor and Cooperativity \n \nThe Purcell factor of the investigated zero -phonon line (ZPL) FZPL, is estimated using the following \nequation9: FZPL = (𝜏𝜏off /𝜏𝜏on  -1)/εZPL 9, where εZPL  is defined by the fraction of the total emission into the ZPL \nvisible at 4K for an SiV, which is estimated by a product of the Debye –Waller factor of 70%50 and the \nbranching ratio of 19.3% into D line at 4K9. For this estimation, we also assume that the lifetime of a SiV \nmeasured in unpatterned area 𝜏𝜏bulk (~1.2 ns) is equal to the off- resonance value9.  \n \nThe theoretical Purcell factor is obtained from the following equation: 𝐹𝐹≡3\n4𝜋𝜋2𝜆𝜆3\n𝑛𝑛3𝑄𝑄\n𝑉𝑉. We use the measured \nQ ~ 1.2x105  and simulated V ~ 0.5( λ/n)3, and estimated F   to be 1.8x104 in the most ideal case.  \n \nThe cooperativity is calculated using C = 4g2/(κγ), where g is the coupling rate between the SiV and the \ncavity,  κ  and γ are the decay rate of the cavity and the emitter, respectively. If the SiV is placed at the \ncavity field maximum, the estimated g is  15.2 GHz, and experimentally, it has been observed to be ~8 \nGHz6. To be \nximum, the estimated g is  15.2 GHz, and experimentally, it has been observed to be ~8 \nGHz6. To be realistic, we use g ~ 8 GHz, the natural SiV linewidth ( γ ~ 0.12 GHz)6, and the measured \nhighest Q of 1.8x105 (κ ~ 2.2 GHz) or Q of 8.4x104 (κ ~ 4.8 GHz) in the critically- coupled case. The \nobtained values are C ~970 or C ~440. If we use the theoretical g ~ 15.2 GHz, the C could be as large as \n3500.  \n \nAcknowledgement  \nThe authors thank Dr. C. De -Eknamkul, Dr. B.

Such superadditivity —a\nhigher communication rate than that achiev-\nable by any physically realizable symbol-by-\nsymbol optical detection—is a special case\nof the celebrated nonlocality without entan-\nglement and has yet to be demonstrated in\npractice. In this article, we propose a prac-\ntical design of the Green Machine —a joint-\ndetection receiver that can attain superaddi-\ntive capacity witha binary-phase-shift-keying\n(BPSK) modulated Hadamard code. We\nbuild this receiver and show that its capac-\nity surpasses that of all practical symbol-by-\nsymbol receivers in the low-received-photon-\nfluxregimeafterbackingoutlosseswithinour\nreceiver. Our Green Machine receiver not\nonly reduces the transmitter peak power re-\nquirement compared with the pulse-position\nmodulation(theconventionalmodulationfor-\nmat used for deep space laser communica-\ntions), but we show that its self-referenced\nphase also makes it more immune to phase\nnoise, e.g., atmospheric turbulence or plat-\nform vibrations, by orders of magnitude com-\nparedwithotherBPSK-compatiblereceivers.\nIntroduction\nHigher communications capacity fuels the Infor-\nmation Age as the demand for faster information\ntransfer continues \nations capacity fuels the Infor-\nmation Age as the demand for faster information\ntransfer continues to surge.

The ultimate limit of communications capac-\nity, given by the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland\n(HSW) theorem [2, 3]—colloquially known as the\nHolevo capacity —is higher than the Shannon capac-\nity achievable by any modulation format paired with\nany physically-permissible optical receiver design.\nThis gap in communications capacity is most signifi-\ncant when the received photon flux is very low [4, 5].\nHowever, inordertoachievetheHolevocapacity, the\nreceiver must make a joint detection, or collective,\nquantum measurement across a long codeword (a\nblock of modulated laser pulses)—an action whose\nstatistical outcome is unobtainable via any receiver\nthat detects each modulated pulse one at a time fol-\nlowed by or interspersed with classical or electronic\npost-processing.\nThe fact that joint detection over a codeword\nblock comprising k \u003E 1modulated pulses can\nachieve a bits-per-pulse rate that exceeds the high-\nest attainable by any receiver that detects one pulse\nat a time is often termed superadditivity . This phe-\nnomenon is a special case of the celebrated quan-\ntum mechanical principle called Quantum Nonlocal-\nity without Entanglement , introduced by Bennett et\nal.[6]:“an orthogonal set of product states (e.g., of\ntwo three-state particles) that nevertheless cannot be\nreliably distinguished by a pair of separated observers\nignorant of which of the states has been presented to\nthem, even if the observers are allowed any sequence\nof local operations and classical communication be-\ntween the separate observers.”\nVarious operational scenarios drive a laser-based\ncommunications system into the regime of very low\nmean received photon number p\n drive a laser-based\ncommunications system into the regime of very low\nmean received photon number per modulated pulse\ninterval, a regime where designing joint-detection re-\nceivers capable of superadditive capacity is benefi-\ncial. One example of that is in a deep-space commu-\nnications downlink, where the transmit laser’s peak\npower which is often limited by satellite payload and\navailable electrical power, and the sheer diffraction-\nlimited loss over a long-range limited by the tele-\nscopesizesonbothends,pushthelinkintoaphoton-\nstarved regime [7, 8]. In a ground-to-space uplink,\nin addition to diffraction, the shower-curtain effect\nof atmospheric turbulence early in the propagation\npath, despite adaptive optics, is a pivotal contribu-\ntor to loss and phase noise (Fig. 1a).\nThe relevant figure of merit to quantify super-\nadditive capacity in the photon-starved regime is\nthe Photon Information Efficiency (PIE): the aver-\nage number of bits (of information) reliably carriedby each received photon. We will denote PIEk=\nCk(¯n)/¯n, where ¯nis the mean photon number per\npulse slot (modulation interval) at the receiver, and\nCk(¯n)is the Shannon capacity—in units of bits re-\nceived per pulse slot—for the given choices of the\nmodulation format and the optical receiver. The\nsuperadditive capacity attained by a joint-detection\nreceiver amounts to PIEk\u003EPIE1, k \u003E 1(Fig. 1b).\nTheHolevolimitofPIEcanbeinterpretedas PIE∞.\nThe Holevo capacity for binary phase-shifted key-\ning (BPSK) modulation in the ¯n≪1regime, to the\nfirst two leading terms, is: PIE∞(¯n) =−log2(¯n) + 1\nbits per photon (bpp) [4], which can be large when\n¯n≪1and is no different from the Holevo-limited\nPIE of an unrestricted modulation format [9]. In\nother words, BPSK modulation is capacity-optimal\ninthephoton-starvedregime. However, whenpaired\nwith the best-known practical receivers for demod-\nulating BPSK (all of which perform symbol-by-\nsymbol detection), the PIE of decoding BPSK mod-\nulation caps off at 2/ln 2≈2\nich perform symbol-by-\nsymbol detection), the PIE of decoding BPSK mod-\nulation caps off at 2/ln 2≈2.89bpp. On the other\nhand, Pulse Position Modulation (PPM), paired\nwith single-photon detection, can achieve PIE(¯n) =\n−log2(¯n)−log2ln(1/¯n)bpp [4], which, despite be-\ning suboptimal compared to the Holevo capacity\nof BPSK, is achievable with conventional detection\ntechnology. PPM transmits one laser pulse of mean\nphoton number M¯nin one of Mconsecutive pulse\nslots. Since the optimal Mincreases as ¯ndecreases,\nin the photon-starved regime, PPM demands a high\npeak-power transmitter, which limits its practical\nutility for ultra-high-loss deep space links, while\nBPSK modulation has the lowest peak-power usage.\nIn this paper, we report our work on realiz-\ning a joint-detection receiver capable of deliver-\ning superadditive capacity with the BPSK alpha-\nbet, first proposed as an N-port linear-optical in-\nterferometer made up of (Nlog2N)/250:50 beam-\nsplitters [1]. The Green Machine (GM) transforms\nlength- NBPSK Hadamard codewords into N-ary\npulse-position-modulation (PPM) codewords prior\nto detection (Fig. 1c), thereby achieving the PIE\nperformance of PPM, which is higher than the PIE\nattainable with BPSK modulation paired with any\nsymbol-by-symbol detection, and using an N-fold\nlower transmitter peak power afforded by BPSK.\nTherefore, it is a receiver capable of superadditivity\nand a practical demonstration of Nonlocality without\nEntanglement [6].\nRealizing the GM receiver based on its original\nproposal [1] would require deserializing Npulses of\n2deb\nDelay (2!)InterfereDelay (2!)\nSwitchVπV0\nc\nS1S2S3(4!)(2!)(!)\n8!\nPM\nAttAliceChannelBob\nPM\nSNSPDS1S2S3\nGreen Machine\n♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢♢□□□□□□□□□□△△△△△△△△△△△△△△○○○○○10-40.0010.0100.1001100.00.51.01.52.02.53.0\nMean photon per symbolPIE(bit/photon)GM1GM2GM3DR\nHomodyneHeterodyne\n!BPSK Hadamard\n!Reduced BPSK HadamardLocal oscillatoraaSymbol-by-symbol dete\nM3DR\nHomodyneHeterodyne\n!BPSK Hadamard\n!Reduced BPSK HadamardLocal oscillatoraaSymbol-by-symbol detectionJoint detection\nU\nPIE!\u003CPIE\"\n0\n1100000\nError\nDownlink\nUplink\n!PPM\n!BPSK  Hadamardbc\nGreen MachineFIG. 2.

Comparison between PIEs for\nthe green machines (GM) with one, two, and three stages and other state-of-the-art receivers. The performances of\nGMs are drawn in colored markers. The error bars are located within the marker if they are not explicitly shown.\nThe colored solid lines show the simulation results with 4. 5%, 2. 5% and 0. 5% crosstalk for the GM1, GM2\nand GM3 experiments, respectively. Practical Dolinar-like receivers are labeled in squares [10], triangles [11], and\ndiamonds [12] with losses excluded. The gray line shows the ideal Dolinar symbol-by-symbol receiver (DR). The light\norange (blue) shade indicates the attainable soft PIE of the shot-noise-limited homodyne (heterodyne) receivers [9].\nThe GM3 \nates the attainable soft PIE of the shot-noise-limited homodyne (heterodyne) receivers [9].\nThe GM3 reaches the highest PIE of 2.947( ±0.019) bits/photon, achieving the superadditivity by outperforming all\ncurrent symbol-by-symbol receivers by 2%, more than three times the standard deviation away.\nthe BPSK Hadamard code, applying lossless differ-\nential delays, followed by an N-port interferome-\nter, which would be extremely difficult, if not im-\npossible, in practice. Recently, a scalable design\nfor the GM was proposed that—via linear mix-\ning of the time and path degrees of freedom—\ntransforms temporally-encoded N-pulse-slot BPSK\nHadamard codewords into N-PPM codewords, us-\ning only log2Nstages, making the idea far more\nfeasible for an experimental implementation [9, 13–\n15]. In this work, we improve the aforesaid design(s)\nbyimplementingMach-Zehnderelectro-opticalmod-\nulators to encode temporal modes with path infor-\nmation. This improvement overcomes the practi-\ncal bandwidth limit of polarization modulation [14,15], eases phase management, and removes pulsed-\noptical control [13] needed in previous proposals.\nWe then demonstrate the three-stage GM (GM3)\nto realize the firstpractical superadditive com-\nmunications system [1], and thereby also demon-\nstrate ’nonlocality without entanglement’ [6] among\na set of product coherent states, using commer-\ncially available fiber-optic components. After back-\ning out losses, the PIE achieved by our realiza-\ntion of GM3 for decoding the eight seven-symbol\nBPSK Hadamard codewords outperforms that of\nan ideal homodyne detection receiver, even if the\nlatter is assumed to be limited by noise only of\nquantum-mechanical origin [16]. Our GM design’s\nPIE also exceeds the PIE achieved by a BPSK mod-\n3ulation paired with the best symbol-by-symbol de-\ntection[11,12,17–20]fortellingapartthetwoBPSK\nmodulated laser-light symbols of mean photon num-\nber¯nat the Helstrom limit (minimum probability of\nerror discrimination) [21], the so-cal\nhoton num-\nber¯nat the Helstrom limit (minimum probability of\nerror discrimination) [21], the so-called Dolinar re-\nceiver[22], which employs adaptive, coherent feed-\nback control and photon detection.\nWe further verify that our GM receiver realiza-\ntion is robust to channel phase noise by the addi-\ntion of an additional BPSK symbol to each of the\neight codewords—making each codeword an eight-\nsymbol codeword—to serve as a local phase refer-\nence. This is a feature unique to the GM that does\nnot exist in other phase-referenced optical receivers,\nwhich makes its superadditive capacity even more\nprominent in noisy-phase environments, e.g., caused\nby imperfect adaptive optics in a turbulent channel\nor platform vibrations, by several orders of magni-\ntude compared to either homodyne detection or the\nDolinar receiver.\nThe Design Principle of the Green Machine\nThecentralprincipleindesigningaGMistoapply\nsimultaneous interferences between multiple pairs of\ntemporal modes [9, 13]. Here, we take a GM3 as an\nexample to illustrate the scalable Hadamard trans-\nform on a temporally-encoded BPSK Hadamard\ncodeword (Fig. 2b). Each symbol is a coherent state\nwith a temporal mode length τ, and each Hadamard\ncodeword contains eight symbols with equal ampli-\ntudes but binary-shifted phases. The full signal is\nreceived by the top port of the first stage (S1).\nThrough S1, the four pairs of symbols that are\n4τduration apart will interfere. These parallel pro-\ncesses are realized by switching the second four sym-\nbols to the second path and delaying the first four\nsymbols by 4τ. The switch is realized by control-\nlingtheelectro-opticalmodulatorwithsquarewaves.\nThen, each pair of symbols arrives at the beamsplit-\nter simultaneously and interferes. The second delay\nline decouples the time frames of the output inter-\nference patterns between the two paths to avoid de-\ngeneracy. Similarly, the second stage (S2) applies a\n2τdelay to match the time of the symbol pairs sit-\nting2τapart, and the la\ncond stage (S2) applies a\n2τdelay to match the time of the symbol pairs sit-\nting2τapart, and the last stage (S3) contains a τ\ndelay. The illustration of multiple BPSK Hadamard\ncodewords sharing the same electro-optical modula-\ntor and decoupling by the second delay line in S2 is\ndepicted in Fig. 2c (see Supplementary Informationfor a complete illustration through S1, S2, and S3).\nAfter three stages, the input binary-phase-shifted\nHadamard codeword is transformed into an eight-\naryPPMcodeword, whereonlyasingleopticalpulse\nat one of the eight pulse slots contains all the pho-\ntons. In the end, the single-photon detection de-\ncodes the PPM codewords by recording the photon\narrival time.\nAn ideal GM3 is a GM with the minimal num-\nber of stages that can attain superadditivity in de-\ncoding BPSK Hadamard codewords, with PIE8\nGM3\n= 3.0 bpp \u003E PIE1≈2.89bpp. This slight ad-\nvantage is easy to be lost due to practical imper-\nfections. However, a local-oscillator coherent state,\nprepared locally at the receiver, can replace the\nfirst symbol of the Hadamard codewords since it\nis the same for all the eight codewords (Fig. 2d),\nassuming the phase can be acquired well enough,\ne.g., using an optical phase-locked loop. This ob-\nservation reduces the number of temporal modes\nrequired to encode the eight Hadamard codewords\nto seven, and hence increases the ideal-GM-receiver\nPIE for the 8-ary BPSK Hadamard codebook to\nPIE8∗\nGM3 =8\n7PIE8\nGM3≈3.43bpp, which allows our\nGM3 to exhibit superadditivity in practice (see Sup-\nplementary Information, and Fig. 2e).\nSuperadditive Communication Demonstration\nWe then validate the GM design and its capabil-\nity to demonstrate superadditivity by implementing\nacompletecommunicationsystemwithalossychan-\nnel between the transmitter (Alice in Fig. 2a) and\nthe receiver (Bob in Fig. 2a). After the indepen-\ndent phase corrections at each stage (see Methods),\nAlice immediately starts to encode her information\ninto the reduced (seven-symbol) BPSK Hadamard\ncod\nAlice immediately starts to encode her information\ninto the reduced (seven-symbol) BPSK Hadamard\ncodewords as a series of N−1binary phase-shifted\ncoherent states with τ= 20ns, repeatedly for 50 ms.\nThe local oscillator, whose binary phase is indepen-\ndent of the encoding, is appended as the first sym-\nbol of the codeword to recover the full N-symbol\nHadamard codeword (Fig. 1d), which is presented to\nthe GM. The average photons per symbol received\nat the GM is governed by the channel loss. After\nthe GM transforms each N-symbol Hadamard code-\nword into an N-PPM codeword, a superconduct-\ning nanowire single-photon detector directly reads\nthe photon arrival time and decodes the informa-\ntion.

PIEs at 7.5×10−3(rectangle)\nand7.5×10−4(triangle) mean photon per symbol with emulated channel phase drift rate. GM3 and the Monte\nCarlo simulations of other receivers share a symbol length of 20 nsand a total communication period of 50 ms. Wi\ntions of other receivers share a symbol length of 20 nsand a total communication period of 50 ms. With\nhigh-frequency intractable phase drift in the channel, homodyne (light orange shades) and Dolinar (gray) receivers\nrapidly drop their PIE. On the contrary, the GM (green), structured homodyne (orange), and ideal heterodyne (blue\nshades) receivers remain robust under phase drift rate until near the modulation bandwidth, where the superadditive\ncommunication of GM3 becomes more prominent.\nforN= 2,4,8, respectively, with an average of\n4×10−5noise photon per symbol.\nThe information transmitted per codeword is cal-\nculated by combining the photon arrival times col-\nlected in each round of transmitting a given code-\nword, to measure the 8by8transition probabil-\nity matrix induced by the GM receiver. Then, the\nPIE is extracted by dividing the mutual informa-\ntion of the channel defined by the aforementioned\ntransition probability matrix by the mean photon\nnumber received in the N−1symbols (after back-\ning out all losses internal to the receiver). The re-\nsults are shown in Fig. 2e. The PIE achieved by\nour GM3 at 0.001to0.01mean photon number per\nBPSK symbol outperforms the shot-noise-limited\nsymbol-by-symbol homodyne receiver (light orange\nshaded regime) [9, 16]. Remarkably, the GM3’s\nPIE also beats the theoretical-best PIE achievable\nby any optical receiver employing symbol-by-symbol\ndetection, which includes the Dolinar receiver and\nan ideal Homodyne detection receiver with soft-\ninformation processing of its output. The PIE of\nour GM3 also outperforms various state-of-the-art\nsymbol-by-symbol quantum receivers (the gray line\nand marks [10–12]). The gap between the PIEs ofthe GM3 and the ideal symbol-by-symbol detection\nreceiver affirms quantum nonlocality without entan-\nglement, which means that product quantum states\ncan hold hidden information that is unattainable\nby symbol-by-symbol detection and classical post-\nprocessing [6, 23].\nUsing the complete N-symbol Hadama\nymbol-by-symbol detection and classical post-\nprocessing [6, 23].\nUsing the complete N-symbol Hadamard code-\nwords, the GM becomes a receiver that does not\nrely on any local oscillator with a phase relation-\nship with the input signal [24]. It utilizes the first\nsymbol of the Hadamard codeword as a self-phase\nreference to interfere with the following symbols [1].\nThis feature gives the GM robustness to counter fast\nchannel-induced phase drift. To validate this claim,\nwe implement an artificial phase drift in the chan-\nnel (Fig. 3a). We scan the mean photon numbers\nwith the phase-noise drift rate of 100kilo cycles per\nsecond (Fig. 3b). Then, we select two mean pho-\nton numbers and scan the phase drift rate from 10\ncycle/s up to 10million cycles/s. The PIEs at-\ntained with phase noise are exhibited in Fig. 3c,\nwhere the GM curves are fitted by an empirical low-\npass band functiona\n1+(f/f0)s(dashed: a= 2.23,\nf0= 1.96MHz, and s= 1.64; dash-dotted: a= 2.47,\nf0= 2.08MHz, and s= 1.61). The performances\n5of the symbol-by-symbol homodyne detection and\nDolinar receivers are fitted from Monte Carlo simu-\nlations with the same data acquisition time ( 50ms)\nand modulation bandwidth ( 50MHz). The hetero-\ndyne upper bound assumes perfect phase correc-\ntion over every symbol. Accounting for real-time\nphase acquisition by the heterodyne detection’s I/Q\nquadrature measurements will further deteriorate its\nPIE performance.\nThe results prove that our practical GM3 receiver\nhas nearly the same phase-drift tolerance as the the-\noretically optimal heterodyne-detection receiver but\nobtains up to 2.3dB higher PIE. Conversely, the\nideal Dolinar receiver and the local-oscilattor shot-\nnoise-limited homodyne detection receiver can not\nbear rapid phase drift, while the GM3 preserves\nits superadditivity in the presence of strong phase\ndrift as long as the rate of phase drift is signifi-\ncantly smaller than the underlying BPSK modula-\ntion bandwidth. It could be contended that this\nadvantage come\nller than the underlying BPSK modula-\ntion bandwidth. It could be contended that this\nadvantage comes from using the Hadamard code-\nwords. So we also show the performance of the\nhard-thresholded homodyne detection receiver on\nthe same BPSK Hadamard codewords in Fig. 3c.\nHere, we see the tolerance to phase drift re-emerge,\nbut three-quarters of the PIE is traded (compared\nwith homodyne used on an unrestricted BPSK-\nmodulated code) to gain phase stability due to the\nself-referenced phase of the BPSK Hadamard code-\nbook.\nDiscussion and Outlook\nIn this work, we present a proof-of-principle plat-\nform to demonstrate a practical Green Machine\n(GM) receiver design with superadditivity demon-\nstration at low mean photon numbers, over a phase-\ndrifting channel, with the receiver’s internal losses\nbacked out. The parallel processing of transform-\ning the N-symbol Hadamard codewords into N-\nPPM codes through log2Nstages, first observed in\nRef. [13], is crucial to the scalability of our GM re-\nceiver design.\nFuture directions include reducing the losses in\nthe receiver, and adding more stages to demonstrate\ntrue superadditivity, i.e., without any loss or other\nimperfectionsbackedout. Thenetlossofthecurrent\nGM3 system is around 15dB, which is primarily in-\ntroduced by commercial electro-optical modulators\n(EOMs). Withimprovedcouplingefficiencyandsidewall smoothness of the waveguides, the EOM loss\ncould be made negligible [25, 26]. If next-generation\nEOMs[27]coupledwithultra-low-lossintegratedde-\nlay lines [28] can further reduce the loss to under 0.4\ndB per stage, scaling up to five GM stages will un-\ndoubtedly overcome the overall net loss, reaching a\nPIE32of≈3.0bpp, retain immunity to phase noise,\nand will beat any ideal symbol-by-symbol receiver in\na realistic operational environment (see Supplemen-\ntary Information).\nAnotherpracticaldirectionistoincreasethemod-\nulationbandwidthtowardsGHztocompetewiththe\nstate-of-the-art single-channel bit rates of other re-\nceivers[29].

Thelengthofdelaylineswillbereduced\nto a submeter level, which will help further reduce\nthe size, loss, and design difficulty for a photonic-\nintegrated GM. The noise photon per symbol will\nbe further suppressed. Moreover, one can overcome\nthe limit caused by a single detector’s dead time by\nmultiplexing multiple single-photon detectors.\nIn summary, our results represent a significant\nmilestone transcending the boundary of practical\nsuperadditive communications towards the ultimate\nHolevo bound of communications capacity based on\ninformation theory and the law of physics. Build-\ning a receiver whose PIE scales better than the GM\nwith the mean photon number, and approaches the\nHolevo limit, will require using quantum processes\n(such as squeezing) within the joint-detection re-\nceiver [30]. Our current demonstration indicates\nthat the GM is capable of boosting the performance\nof extreme deep-space laser communication systems\nby giving it resilience to phase drift, a superad-\nditive PIE (assuming BPSK modulation), achiev-\ning orders of magnitude lower transmitter peak\npower (compared to PPM modulation), and low er-\nror rates [31]. Future modifications, including more\nstages with lower losses, quantum sources [32], and\nreceivers designed to better distinguish PPM code-\nwords [12, 18, 33], could enable more capacity for\nthe GM and more advanced receiver designs.\nThe optical Green Machine we have built also\nhas other applications, e.g., in (1) designing re-\nceivers for entanglement-assisted classical communi-\ncations [34], (2) reading information efficiently from\na passively-encoded reflective classical memory us-\ning a spatially-entangled probe [35], and (3) loading\nthe quantum state of 1photon spread across Ntime\nbins into log2Natomic quantum memories [36] us-\ningageneralizationoftheDuan-Kimblescheme[37].\nThe pursuit of quantum receivers that achieve\n6the Holevo capacity is fa\noftheDuan-Kimblescheme[37].\nThe pursuit of quantum receivers that achieve\n6the Holevo capacity is far from being concluded\nwith the GM. Over the decades, piles of theoret-\nical proposals have elucidated receivers capable of\nachievingsuperadditivitywithsuitablemodulations,\ncodes, and joint-detection measurements [1, 38–\n42], but practical solutions other than the GM\nremain elusive. Moreover, there is strong theo-\nretical evidence suggesting that joint-detection re-\nceivers whose internal optical transformations and\ndetections are limited to those whose statisti-\ncal properties are accurately describable using the\nsemi-classical theory of photodetection (GM being\nsuch an example of a joint-detection receiver as\nwell)—despite being superadditive-communications\ncapable—cannot achieve the Holevo capacity [30].\nIn theory, there are many alternative designs of\nreceivers that would explicitly achieve the Holevo\ncapacity, e.g., (1) quantum polar code and suc-\ncessive cancelation receiver [4], (2) the slicing re-\nceiver [43], (3) codeword unambiguous state dis-\ncrimination [44], and (4) the sequential-decoding re-\nceiver [45] using the multimode collective vacuum\nor not measurement [46]. The primary bottleneck\nin the practical realization of any of these strate-\ngies is the need for quantum-coherent operations\nthat involve either hard-to-realize all-optical non-\nGaussian transformations or even harder-to-realize\ninner-product-preserving transduction of the BPSK\ncoherent states into the state of a qubit and pro-\ncessed by a fault-tolerant quantum computer [47].\nTherefore, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) era, the GM receiver is undoubtedly a com-\npetitive near-term solution to photon-starved com-\nmunications that could afford a practical advantage\nover existing methods.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge the support from NASA\n(80NSSC22K1030) and the NSF ERC Center for\nQuantum Networks (EEC-1941583).

The en-\ntire setup is tightly mounted to an optical bread-\nboard with a temperature sensor, an evenly dis-\ntributed heater, and a home-built PID controller\nloop to reduce phase noise caused by fiber motion\nand temperature fluctuation. The delay lines are\n16mfor S1, 8mfor S2, and 4mfor S3. Square\nwaves control the switch modulators (EOSpace cus-\ntomized lithium niobate modules, 20GHz band-\nwidth)atnearly6.25MHz(S1), 6.25MHz+ π/2phase\n(S2), and 12.5MHz+ π/2phase (S3). Phase encod-\ning is achieved by loading a 6.25MHz, a 12.5MHz,\nand a 25MHz signal to PMs (Thorlabs, 10GHz\nbandwidth). All signals are generated by arbi-\ntrary wave generators (Rigol DG4102 AWG) capa-\nble of generating Vpp=10V(5V) square waves within\n20MHz(30MHz).\nFor each stage, the crosstalk is only sensitive to\nthe relative phase drift of two fiber links between\nthe switch and the beamsplitter [15]. To correct the\nphase of each stage, we send a bright probe laser\nlight (Newfocus Telecom Laser 6428) into the sys-\ntem and tap\nch stage, we send a bright probe laser\nlight (Newfocus Telecom Laser 6428) into the sys-\ntem and tap 1% after each stage’s beamsplitter. We\nscan the relative phase between symbols from 0- 2π\nthree times, each lasting a single period of 1ms, by\nthe PM (Bob) in front of the S1. The scan starts\nfrom the first stage. The phase control signal is first\ngeneratedfromanFPGA(RedPitayaSTEMlab125-\n14), amplified (SRS SIM911 BJT preamplifier), and\nsent as an amplitude modulation to the square wave\n7signal generator (Rigol DG4102 AWG) connected to\nthePM.Thedetectorwithlimitedbandwidth(New-\nport InGaAs Fiber-Optic Receiver 2011, tuned to\n10kHz bandwidth) reads the power envelope of the\nvarying tapped light, and the output is collected by\nthe same FPGA. The computer fits it by a sin func-\ntion and triggers the FPGA output voltage to retain\nmaximumorminimuminterference. Immediatelyaf-\nter, the phase control signal is set to this proper\nDC voltage to compensate for the phase. Similarly,\nin series, the phase drifts of S2 and S3 are com-\npensated. The entire phase correction takes roughly\n30ms, which is limited by the Ethernet communica-\ntion latency between the data acquisition units, the\ncontrol units, and the computer. After phase cor-\nrection, the three relative phases can remain stable\nfor more than 100msin most scenarios.\nParameter sweep and data acquisition. Al-\nice, channel, and Bob are all controlled by a Python\nscript running on the computer. The script switches\nbetween phase correction and data acquisition in a\ncontinuous way. During the phase correction, the\nchannel is switched to low attenuation to share the\nlaser by a programmable optical attenuator (JAS\nFitel HA9 Optical Attenuator). After phase cor-\nrection, the channel is switched to high attenua-\ntion with artificial phase drift to emulate the ac-\ntual channel, and Alice’s phase encoding changes to\ndial the Hadamard codeword.

Richard R.\nGreenofNASA’sJetPropulsionLaboratory, whenpursuinghisPh. D.atCaltechproposeda\n\"Serial Orthogonal Decoder\"[48] for a specific set of block codewords defined by sequentially\ntensored Hadamard matrices. A traditional decoder for the book would require 2Naddition\nor subtraction actions for the N-length code, which at the time was a high overhead for\ncomputing devices. By recognizing that the code was able to be transformed through a\nseries of permutation operations, Green devised a design for a scalable \"machine\" capable\nof decoding the codebook with log2Nidentical stages for an arbitrary N-length Hadamard\ncodebook. The results were promising, showing that a 7-stage \"machine\" would be capable\nof achieving \u003E35Kbps transmission.\nGreen’s idea was put to use only a few years later for the Mariner-9 mission, the first\ndevice to orbit another planet. Mission designers sought to transmit grayscale images of\nthe Martian surface back to Earth using binary 6-tuples representing the 64-bit pixel values.\nWith a channel error rate of 5%, each pixel error rate would be 26%. This failure rate\nwas far too high for such a critical mission, especially considering the intention to transmit\nthe data as a live feed and to orient the camera in response to what was seen. Due to\non to transmit\nthe data as a live feed and to orient the camera in response to what was seen. Due to\npower limitations, the mission allowed a forward error correction code to embed the 6-tuples\ninto 30 channel uses. The mission designers finally chose to use the first-order Reed-Solomon\n(Hadamard)codewithGreen’scircuitdesignandinternallydubbedit\"TheGreenMachine\".\nThe current Green Machine receiver design stems directly from the author Saikat Guha’s\n2011 paper [1] on using Joint-Detection Receivers (JDR) to approach the Holevo capacity\noverclassic and quantumcommunication channels. Theideafor the time-multiplexed optical\nGreen Machine was first considered and attempted experimentally by Timothy Rambo at\nNorthwestern University, Illinois, USA, who was able to realize a single-stage device experi-\nmentally [13] and independently developed by Konrad Banaszek and Michał Jachura [14, 15]\nat the University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, at almost the same time. This work, in a\nsimilar vein, brings to fruition the first realization of a multi-stage Green Machine JDR for\n10superadditive classical-quantum communications.\n11THEORETICAL BACKGROUND IN A NUTSHELL\nBPSK, PPM and Hadamard Codewords in Optical Communication\nIn classic optical communications, transmission is usually achieved by modulating a laser\nsource. The quantized electromagnetic field of an ideal CW laser in a single spatiotemporal\nmode can be described as a coherent state by the complex amplitude α.\n|α⟩=e−|α|2/2X\nnαn\n√\nn!|n⟩ (1)\nBinary phase-shifted keying (BPSK) is a common modulation formatted across digital\ncommunications. In optical systems, modulation embeds information into coherent state\nsymbols picked from the alphabet ABPSK ={|α⟩,|−α⟩}. For this alphabet, the transmitter\ngenerates one of the two coherent states that lasts for τseconds. An optical receiver is then\ntasked to perform optimal discrimination between the symbols sent during each channel use.\nBased on Shannon’s information theory and the fundament\nen the symbols sent during each channel use.\nBased on Shannon’s information theory and the fundamental quantum properties of the\ncoherent states, the symbol-by-symbol encoding and decoding of the BPSK signals are\nbounded to the Photon Information Efficiency (PIE) of 2 log2e≈2.89bits per photon\n(bpp). Grouping the symbols into codewords allows forward error correction, which is es-\nsential in modern communication systems. One iconic format for grouping up BPSK sym-\nbols is the Hadamard code, also known as the Reed-Solomon code, which is constructed\nfrom the Hadamard–Rademacher–Walsh transform matrix. The eight-symbol standard (full)\nHadamard BPSK codewords we are using in this experiment are\n12|X1⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|X2⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|X3⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|X4⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|X5⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|X6⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|X7⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|X8⟩=|α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩(2)\nApparently, the first symbol (we call it the phase symbol) does not contribute to the\ndistance among codewords (it only provides a phase reference), which means that a vacuum\nstate can replace it. Then, on the receiver side, a local oscillator can supply the phase symbol\nand increase the PIE by N/(N−1). This amount of information boost is significant when\nNis small. The eight-symbol reduced Hadamard BPSK codewords we are using in this\nexperiment are\n|˜X1⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|˜X2⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|˜X3⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|˜X4⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|˜X5⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|˜X6⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|˜X7⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗\n |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩\n|˜X6⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|˜X7⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩\n|˜X8⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |α⟩ ⊗ |− α⟩(3)\nPulse-position modulation (PPM) is another widely used modulation format in photon-\nstarvedregimes, suchasdeep-spacecommunication. Combinedwithdirectphotondetection,\n13the PPM can reach higher PIE than BPSK with classical detection but requires higher peak\npower, which poses a challenge to the transmitter. With the same mean photon numbers\nper codeword as BPSK, the 8-PPM codewords are\n|Xppm1⟩=|√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm2⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm3⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm4⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm5⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm6⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm7⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩ ⊗ |0⟩\n|Xppm8⟩=|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ ⊗ |√\n8α⟩(4)\nReceivers and Their Capacities\nBased on Shannon’s information theory, the classical channel capacity defines the amount\nof information able to be transmitted in a single channel use (codeword sent).\nC(¯n) = max\npX\u0014\nI(X;Y)\u0015\n, (5)\nwhere I(X;Y)is the classic mutual information. In the case of our channel, the transmitter\nencodes X, and the receiver’s outputs are Ywith ¯nphotons received per channel on average,\nrespectively. Then, the PIE is defined as PIE= C(¯n)/¯n.\nIn photon-starved communications, the Holevo PIE, a.k.a. the quantum-mechanically\nallowed highest possible PIE ≈log21\n¯n+ log2ebpp without specifying the transmitter or\nreceiver, is attainable using BPSK encoding, while any symbol-by-symbol detection receiver\ncannot. (1) The homodyne receiver has the PIE ≈1\n2¯nlog2(1+4¯ n)bpp with the cost of having\na robust local oscillator with perfect phase reference to the source.

An important\npoint of distinction is that PPM with direct detection does not rely on any local oscillator or\nphase reference, since the free phase parameters of each codeword are eliminated by direct\ndetection. The GM we build is to transform the full N-symbol Hadamard codewords into\nN-PPM codewor\nt\ndetection. The GM we build is to transform the full N-symbol Hadamard codewords into\nN-PPM codewords within log2Nstages so that it not only cuts the need for a high-peak-\npower laser, but also enjoys the PPM’s advantages on higher PIE and immunity to channel\nphase drift, which we will show later. The PIE of the N-symbol Hadamard codebook with\nthe GM receiver has the same capacity as the N-PPM with direct photon detection.\nPIE GM/PPM=1−e−N¯n\nN¯nlog2N (7)\nFor more details, we suggest the review article [9] by Konrad Banaszek.\nSuperadditive communication and nonlocality without entanglement\nSuperadditive communication is achieved when the PIE of a joint-detection receiver is\nhigher than that of any symbol-by-symbol detection with any electronic postprocessing. It\nmeans that adding one symbol to the codeword gains information higher than the informa-\ntion contained in that symbol individually. If no hidden information is embedded in the\nconcatenation of symbols, adding more symbols will only linearly increase the information,\na.k.a. an additive channel. That is to say, the existence of superadditive communication\n16means that joint detection can extract more information from a product state than any\nsymbol-by-symbol detections.\nFrom the quantum information perspective, it also means that this quantum system with-\nout entanglement can show some relation among the subsystems. Since these subsystems\nare generated in a time series, they have never talked to each other before arriving at the\nmeasurement apparatus. This infers that this type of relation is a facet of nonlocality, first\nintroduced in Charles Bennet’s paper [6], as quoted in the main text.\nOur current experiment has demonstrated superadditive communication and nonlocality\nwithout entanglement by showing that a GM3 receiver decoding reduced Hadamard BPSK\nsecures a higher PIE than any symbol-by-symbol detections. In the current interpretation,\nwe exclude the net loss of all receivers. This is a practical distin\n In the current interpretation,\nwe exclude the net loss of all receivers. This is a practical distinction for this claim since\nheterodyne and homodyne receivers usually have much lower losses than the current GM3\nsetup. However, the current loss of GM3 does not come from any fundamental physical\nlimit, which means that it could be improved with better devices, especially the electro-\noptical modulators. The feasibility of developing low-loss GM receivers will be an important\nquestion in forthcoming extensions of this work.\n17PHASE SYMBOL, CHANNEL PHASE NOISE, AND MONTE CARLO\nSIMULATIONS\nThe first symbol of the Hadamard BPSK code adds no distinguishability to the codewords.\nThus, it can be generated on either the receiver or transmitter sides. In real-world applica-\ntions where phase reference is hard to track, such as deep-space communication, this phase\nsymbol applied on the transmitter side will experience channel properties together with the\nrest of the symbols. The timescale of the codeword is so short that the channel phase remains\nnearly the same. Therefore, having this phase symbol will make the communication system\nrobust to channel phase noise.\nTo illustrate this advantage over other symbol-by-symbol detection receivers, we deployed\nMonte Carlo simulations to predict the performances of ideal homodyne, collective threshold\nhomodyne and ideal Dolinar receivers under different channel phase drift rates over a certain\namount of time ( 50ms).\n(I) The ideal symbol-by-symbol homodyne/heterodyne receiver decodes each symbol as\na real number based on the output of homodyne/heterodyne detection, where Shannon\n(soft) information can be extracted by including forward error correction and other post-\nprocessing [9].\n(II) The threshold homodyne receiver directly decodes each BPSK symbol based on the\nsign of the output of homodyne detection, yielding a \"0\" if the sign is positive or a \"1\" if\nnegative. The threshold homodyne receiver is more flexible in practical implemen\nositive or a \"1\" if\nnegative. The threshold homodyne receiver is more flexible in practical implementation as\nit fits short codewords with digitized collective postprocessing. Therefore, we also simulate\nit on decoding eight-symbol Hadamard codewords as a direct competitor toward the Green\nMachine.\n(III) The ideal Dolinar receiver in the simulation applies an immediate feedforward strat-\negy [49] to change the phase of the local oscillator according to the photon detection history\nwithin each symbol. The ideal Dolinar receiver reaches the lowest possible error rate (Hel-\nstrom bound) in decoding each BPSK symbol.\nThe Monte Carlo results indicate that the PIEs of Dolinar and homodyne receivers that\nneed an extra phase reference to generate a local oscillator start dropping at 10Hz-level\n18FIG. S2. Monte Carlo simulation results for PIEs w.r.t different phase drift rates.\nphase noise. Using the same eight-symbol Hadamard encoding and threshold homodyne\nreceiver for decoding will provide more robustness to phase noise, but reduce the PIE. On\nthe contrary, the heterodyne receiver can leverage the second-quadrature information to\ncorrect the phase drift but suffers a reduced PIE. Moreover, if the phase drift is as fast\nas the modulation bandwidth, the signal arriving at the receiver will be in a mixed state;\nthus, none of the receivers can extract information from it. To not compromise our claim of\npracticalsuperadditivity,weaggressivelyassumethattheupperboundofanidealheterodyne\nreceiver can retain its PIE until the phase drift approaches the modulation bandwidth with\nthe best possible strategy of phase correction that uses the extra quadrature. However, in\npractice, the PIE of the heterodyne receiver will drop at a much slower phase-drift rate\nwithout perfect phase-tracking.\n19EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CALIBRATION\nFollowingthe Methodssectionattheendofthemain text, here, weexpandtothedetails of\ntheexperimentalsetup(Fig.S3a), logicflows(Fig.S3bandFig.S4), andphasecompensatio\npandtothedetails of\ntheexperimentalsetup(Fig.S3a), logicflows(Fig.S3bandFig.S4), andphasecompensation\n(Fig. S5a) in this section.

After\nfitting the phase shift of the sinfunction, the computer will tell the FPGA to generate a DC\nvoltage to compensate for the S1 phase.\nThe process for S2 and S3 is similar.

For S3, it is at 25MHz to add an extra phase to all even symbols (2, 4, 6, 8). Note\nthat the compensation for the S2 phase must wait until the S1 phase is compensated, and\nfor the S3 phase, it must wait until both the S1 and S2 phases are compensated. Otherwise,\nthere will be ambiguity.\nThe phase compensation points for all stages can be chosen as a combination of the max-\nimum or minimum of the sinfunction, which only changes the code mapping. In Fig. S5a,\nthe detailed flow shows the case where all phase compensation points are maximum.\nWe have tested the compensation performance by recording the monitor output with an\nadditional 50msdelay after 50msdata acquisition and comparing it with the output during\nphase scanning. The comparison results of compensating to the maximum at S1, minimum\nat S2, and maximum at S3 are shown in Fig. S5b. The\nts of compensating to the maximum at S1, minimum\nat S2, and maximum at S3 are shown in Fig. S5b. The error rates of each codeword, a piece\nof the histogram, and the mean photon of each codeword in each round of experiment are\ncollected in Fig. S5c, d, & e, which visualizes an example of data processing for figures in the\nmain text. It is clear that the system is running near the ideal phase-compensated points\nduring data acquisition.\n23...",

In this work, we design protocolsthat schedule entanglement swapping in quantum switches. Incontrast to most existing studies, we consider that entanglementrequests randomly arrive at the switch, and determine the\ncapacity region of rate vectors that the switch can support stably.\nFor a rate vector inside the capacity region, we develop protocolsthat not only stabilize the switch, but also achieve zero averagelatency. Among these protocols, the on-demand protocols arecomputationally efﬁcient and achieve high ﬁdelity and low latencydemonstrated by results obtained using a quantum networkdiscrete event simulator.\nIndex T erms—quantum switch, entanglement distribution,\nquantum networking\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networks will play a critical role in enabling nu-\nmerous quantum applications such as quantum key distribution\n[1]–[4], teleportation [5]–[7], and quantum sensing [8]–[10].\nOne of the major tasks of quantum networks is distributing\nquantum entanglement among ge ographically separated nodes.\nSuch a task usually involves generating Einstein-Podolsky-\nRosen (EPR) pairs through quantum channels and then per-\nforming entanglement swappi ng among the generated EPR\npairs. For example, consider a star-shape network consistingof a center node and a collection of end nodes. Entanglementswapping is performed at the center node to establish entangle-\nment among end nodes. The center node serves as a quantum\nswitch, a critical building block in quantum \nt among end nodes. The center node serves as a quantum\nswitch, a critical building block in quantum networks. SeeFigure 1 for details.\nA key problem in the implementation of a quantum switch\nis decision-making about which EPR pairs to perform en-\ntanglement swapping operations on. The prioritization of en-\ntanglement swapping affects the performance of the switch,\nsuch as the ﬁdelity of the distributed entanglement, the\nlatency of the entanglement requests, and the throughputof the switch.

Note that a protocol that\nmaximizes the entanglement gene\nis not\nvery large with a high probability. Note that a protocol that\nmaximizes the entanglement generation rate may not stabilizethe switch since the number of unaddressed entanglement\nrequests may grow to inﬁnity sub-linearly with respect to\ntime. The goal of this manuscript is to solve the following\ntwo problems: What is the capacity region of the switch?

Note that in classical data networks, stability is widely\nused to investigate protocols for data routing and resource\nallocation [11]–[13]. These studies cannot be directly applied\nto quantum networks because entanglement swapping involve\ntwo interfaces, whereas data transmission in classical data\nnetworks normally involves one link. Moreover, entanglementgenerated through quantum channels can be stored to satisfy\nfuture entanglement requests whereas in classical networks,\ndata have to arrive ﬁrst and then get transmitted throughchannels.

B ACKGROUND\nIn this section, we provide some background information\nused in this manuscript. An EPR pair is a quantum state\nconsisting of two qubits:\n|ΨAB/angbracketright=1\n√\n2(|0A/angbracketright|0B/angbracketright+|1A/angbracketright|1B/angbracketright)\nwhere |0/angbracketrightand|1/angbracketrightare qubits represented by two-dimensional\nvectors, and the subscripts AandBrepresent two physics\nsystems.\nOne can use entanglement swapping at an intermediate party\nCto generate an EPR pair between two parties AandB[14].\nIn our setup, the quantum switch generates EPR pairs with end\nnodes through quantum channels, and performs entanglement\nswapping to generate EPR pairs between end nodes.\nGenerating EPR pairs between the quantum switch and end\nnodes requires qubit transmissi on through quantum channels.\nOne of the widely used mediums for qubit transmission is\noptical ﬁber, and correspondingly, the qu\n.\nOne of the widely used mediums for qubit transmission is\noptical ﬁber, and correspondingly, the quantum informationin qubits are carried by photons. For a single photon thatgoes through optical ﬁber, with probability pthis photon\nsuccessfully reaches the receiver, and with probability 1−pit is\nlost. Note that we consider hera lded entanglement generation,\ni.e., the results of entanglement generation, either success orfailure, are known to the switch.\nEntanglement swapping requires making Bell state measure-\nments on two qubits at the quantum switch. This can be doneby performing a CNOT operation and making measurements\nwith standard computation basis. In practice, CNOT operations\nare not always successful when implemented using linearoptics [15]–[17] or photon-spin interaction [18]. Therefore, we\nmodel the Bell state measurement as a probabilistic operator:\nwith probability q, it succeeds and the EPR pair between the\ncorresponding two end nodes is generated; with probability1−q, no EPR pair is generated between the two end nodes\nalthough the two EPR pairs between the quantum switch and\nthe two end nodes are consumed.\nIII. R\nELA TED WORK\nQuantum switches are important components of quantum\nnetworks, and have attracted increasing research interest [19]–\n[22]. In [19], a quantum switch that serves multipartite entan-\nglement to a set of end nodes is analyzed. In [20], a similar\nsetup that focuses on bipartite entanglement distribution isconsidered. Compared to [19], the model of the quantum\nswitch in [20] is more general, accounting for decoherence\nof quantum states in the memory and ﬁnite memory size.\nThe setup in this manuscript is signiﬁcantly different from\nthese studies in three aspects. Fi rst, entanglement generation\nbetween the quantum switch and end nodes in these studies\nis formulated as a continuous-time Markov chain, i.e., at\neach time slot, one and only one of entanglement pair isgenerated through the quantum channels. In this manuscript,\ninstead of the \ne of entanglement pair isgenerated through the quantum channels. In this manuscript,\ninstead of the continuous-time Markov chain, we adopt the\ndiscrete-time Markov chain, which is shown to be much more\nchallenging for analysis [21]. Second, [19]–[22] implicitly\nassume that the number of entanglement requests for everypair of users is inﬁnite at any time slot, and when the quantum\nswitch performs entanglement swapping or GHZ projection\nsuccessfully, the generated bipartite or tripartite entanglementis immediately released from me mory to address the entangle-\nment requests. In this manuscript, the entanglement requestsrandomly arrive at the switch acco rding to a stochastic process\nmodel. Correspondingly, the deﬁn ition of stability is different\nfrom [19], and we focus on the unaddressed entanglementrequests at the quantum switch. Third, one of the contributions\nof this manuscript is the design of entanglement swapping\nprotocols, whereas in [19]–[22], the operations of the quantumswitch are relatively simple. The reason for such differences is\nthe introduction of entanglement requests, and the objective of\nthe switch is to address these requests instead of maximizing\nthe entanglement switching rate.\nEntanglement swapping protocols are proposed for networks\nwith other structures than the star-shaped ones. In a recent\npaper [23], entanglement distribution for a network consistingof quantum switches and users is considered. Similarly to this\n390\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Massachusetts Amherst. Downloaded on July 26,2023 at 01:22:26 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. manuscript, entanglement requests are considered. However,\nthe setup in this manuscript is signiﬁcantly different that in\n[23]. First, the lifetime of a qubit is assumed to be one\ncycle in [23], but the lifetime is assumed to be inﬁnite\nin this manuscript. Second, the protocols proposed in [23]\nhave high computational complexities, whereas most of theprotocols, especially the \nproposed in [23]\nhave high computational complexities, whereas most of theprotocols, especially the on-demand protocols, proposed in\nthis manuscript are efﬁcient. Third, we show the proposed\nprotocols can achieve zero average latency in addition to sta-bility. Another example of entanglement swapping protocols\nis [24], where the authors propose an approach to calculate\nthe average waiting time for generating an entangled pairin quantum repeater chains. Similarly to the studies on the\nquantum switch, this work aims at maximizing entanglement\ngenerating rate rather than addressing entanglement requests\nbetween end nodes.\nIV . S\nYSTEM MODEL\nConsider a star-shape network consisting of K+1 nodes,\nwhere node 0is a quantum switch and the rest are end nodes.\nThe quantum switch has Kinterfaces that serve EPR pairs,\nwhere interface kserves EPR pairs between the switch and\nnode k,k∈K ={1,2,...,K }. Time is slotted and at each\ntime slot t, three types of events may occur, described as\nfollows.\nEntanglement Generation: The quantum switch attempts to\ngenerate EPR pairs with end nodes. An EPR pair between\nthe quantum switch and node kis generated with probability\npk,k∈K using a quantum channel. One qubit of each EPR\npair is stored at the switch and the other at the end node.\nLetC0i(t)denotes the number of EPR pairs |Ψ0i/angbracketrightgenerated\nbetween the quantum switch and node i∈K at time slot t,\nand we assume that {C0i(t):t≥0},i∈K are mutually\nindependent Bernoulli processes.1\nEntanglement Swapping: The quantum switch performs\nentanglement swapping operations.

P\nROTOCOL DESIGN\nIn this section, we design several protocols, namely, the\nstationary and the on-demand protocol, for entanglement\nswapping in a quantum switch. More importantly, we showthat these protocols stabilize the switch when the rate matrix\nis within the capacity region. For simp\nat these protocols stabilize the switch when the rate matrix\nis within the capacity region. For simplicity, we assume\nthat the quantum switch can perform an arbitrary number of\nentanglement swapping operations (i.e., W=∞), but all of\n4We do not distinguish between the order of nodes iandj, i.e., fij=fji,\n∀i, j∈K .the protocols can be easily modiﬁed to satisfy the constraint\non the number of entanglement swapping operations per time\nslot. The stationary protocol requires knowing the rate matrix\nand channel parameters, and does not depend on the statesof the system. The on-demand protocols do not require any\nknowledge of rate matrix or channel parameters. Though they\nneed to solve an optimization problem every time slot, thisoptimization problem can be efﬁciently solved.\nA. Stationary Protocol\nWe ﬁrst design a stationary protocol π\nstat as follows.\nStationary Protocol: Suppose the rate matrix (λij)i,j∈K is\nknown to the quantum switch and there exists /epsilon1\u003E0such that\n(λij+/epsilon1)i,j∈K∈Λ. (6)\nThen there exists a set of variables {˜fij}i,j∈K such that\n/summationdisplay\ni∈K˜fij≤pj,∀j∈K (7)\nλij+/epsilon1≤q˜fij,∀i, j∈K.

This\nmotivates the design of on-demand protocols.\nB. On-demand Protocol\nWe next develop an on-demand protocol that has the ﬂexi-\nbility to prioritize entanglement requests as long as they satisfy\ncertain constraints.\nOn-demand Protocols: At each time slot, the quantum\nswitch attempts to create entanglement |Ψij/angbracketrightusing Fijpairs of\nentanglement |Ψ0i/angbracketrightandFijpairs of entanglement |Ψ0j/angbracketright.T h e\ndecisions {Fij}i,j∈K need to satisfy the following constraints:\n/summationdisplay\ni∈KFij≤E0j(t)+ C0j(t),j ∈K (9)\nFij≤Uij(t)+ Aij(t),i , j ∈K (10)\nFij=Fji∈N,i , j ∈K\n/parenleftbig\nE0i(t)+ C0i(t)−/summationdisplay\nk∈KFik/parenrightbig/parenleftbig\nE0j(t)+ C0j(t)−/summationdisplay\nk∈KFkj/parenrightbig\n·/parenleftbig\nUij(t)+ Aij(t)−Fij/parenrightbig\n=0,i , j ∈K. (11)\nThen the quantum switch attempts to create entanglement|Ψ\nij/angbracketrightusing Fijpairs of entanglement |Ψ0i/angbracketrightandFijpairs\nof entanglement |Ψ0j/angbracketright. An on-demand protocol is denoted by\nπod.\nRemark 1: The intuition of (10) in on-demand protocols is\nthat the quantum switch creates entanglement only to serve\nexisting requests. Moreover, the quantum switch should not\n“waste” any opportunities to creat e entanglement, in the sense\nthat for any i, j, it should attempt to create as many pairs\nof|Ψij/angbracketrightas possible provi\nthat for any i, j, it should attempt to create as many pairs\nof|Ψij/angbracketrightas possible provided that (10) holds. This gives the\ncondition (11). Note that there may be multiple choices of\n{Fij}i,j∈K that satisfy the constraints. The quantum switch\ncan select any one of them for entanglement swapping.\nRemark 2: One way to satisfy constraints (9)-(11) is to\nﬁrst set Fij=0 ,i, j∈K and then check the unﬁnished\nentanglement requests {Uij(t)}i,j∈K in any order. Details are\ngiven in Algorithm 1. Note that the complexity is O(K2)since\nthe iteration is over i, j∈K . Comparatively, the stationary\nprotocol also has a complexity O(K2)in average since the\nswitch has to randomly label every EPR generated between the\nswitch and nodes. In practice the complexity is much lower. Infact, as shown later in Appendix I, F\nij(t)= Uij(t)+ Aij(t)\nwith a high probability, and there is no need to solve anyoptimization problem.\nIn order to establish stability of the on-demand protocols,\nwe need to make the following assumption with on-demandprotocols.\nAlgorithm 1 On-demand Protocol\nInput: E0j(t),C0j(t),∀j∈K ,Uij(t),Aij(t),∀i, j∈K\nOutput: Fij∀i, j∈K that satisfy (9) to (11)\n1:Initialization: Fij=0∀i, j∈K\n2:fori, j∈K do\n3: Fij← min{ Uij(t)+ Aij(t),E0i(t)+ C0i(t)−/summationtext\nk∈K,k/negationslash=iFkj,E0j(t)+ C0j(t)−/summationtext\nk∈K,k/negationslash=iFkj}\n4:end for\nAssumption 1: For an arbitrary /epsilon10\u003E0, consider the\nfollowing event:\nB0:∃i, j,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1\nt+1t/summationdisplay\nτ=0Aij(τ)−λij/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u003E/epsilon1\n0.

Z ERO AVERAGE LA TENCY\nIn previous sections, we showed that the stationary and on-\ndemand protocols stabilize the switch provided the rate matrix\nis an interior point of the capacity region. In this section, we\ntake a step further and show that with slight modiﬁcation, these\nprotocols achieve zero average latency.\nIt sufﬁces to show for all i, j∈K\nlim\nt→∞E[Uij(t)] = 0 . (14)\nTherefore, we only need to show the expected queue lengthE[U\nij(t)]converges to 0. This coupled with Little’s law [26]\nallows us to conclude that average latency is zero. To do this,we need a stronger assumption than Assumption 1.\nAssumption 2: For an arbitrary /epsilon1\n0\u003E0, consider the\nfollowing event:\nC0:∃i, j,1\nt+1t/summationdisplay\nτ=0Aij(τ)\u003Eλ ij+/epsilon10.

Therefore, (19) converges to zero\nastgoes to inﬁnity. This concludes the proof.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the stationary protocol\nrequires knowing the rate matrix (λij)i,j∈K, which may not\nbe available in practice. To address this issue, we develop on-\ndemand protocols with virtual requests that provide for zero\nlatency. They allow the switch to create and store end-to-endentanglement that can be used to some future requests, so\nlatency can be made arbitrarily small. In particular, select α∈\n(1/2,1)and deﬁne\n/tildewideA\nij(t)= Aij+⌈(t+1 )α⌉−⌈ tα⌉ (20)\nwhere the term ⌈(t+1 )α⌉−⌈ tα⌉is the virtual request.

N UMERICAL RESULTS\nIn this section, we investigate the performance of the sta-\ntionary and the on-demand protocols with a quantum networkdiscrete event simulator, NetSquid [27]. Since the stability of\nthese protocols are proven in previous sections, we focus onother performance metrics in p ractical scenarios. Moreover,\nwe relax several assumptions including the inﬁnite amount ofmemory for storing EPR pairs and the inﬁnite qubit lifetime.\nA. Simulation Setting\nA quantum switch can be implemented with different tech-\nnologies. For example, qubits stored in quantum memories can\nbe realized with electron spi ns of SiV defect centers [28]. A\nquantum switch is equipped with photon sources, and each of\n394\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Massachusetts Amherst. Downloaded on July 26,2023 at 01:22:26 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. them generates a pair of entangled photons in each time slot.\nOne of the photons interacts with the electron spin, and the\nother photon is sent to one of the end nodes through a quantum\nchannel and interacts with the electron spin at the end node. A\nphoton-spin interaction is essentially a CNOT operation on the\nphoton and the spin. After the photon-spin interaction, photonsare measured in the X basis by beamsplitters and photon\ndetectors. Entanglement swapping in the quantum switch can\nalso be realized with photon-spin interactions. To be consistentwith practical devices, we assume that qubits stored in the\nmemory suffer from decoherence. Furthermore, we assume\nthat the quantum switch has a ﬁnite nu\nin the\nmemory suffer from decoherence. Furthermore, we assume\nthat the quantum switch has a ﬁnite number of memoryslots, and these memory slots are equally distributed among\ninterfaces. With these practical constraints, we can evaluate\nmore performance metrics:\n•Average ﬁdelity: for a state ρshared between node iand\nj, the ﬁdelity is deﬁned as F(ρ)= /angbracketleftΨij|ρ|Ψij/angbracketright.N o t e\nthat a generated EPR pair m ay decohere in the memory\nslots before being used to serve entanglement requests.\n•Average latency: the latency of an entanglement request is\ndeﬁned as the amount of time to address the entanglement\nrequest. Note that the entanglement request may occur atany time in a slot, and we evaluate the latency in units\nof nanoseconds rather than slots.\nThe developed protocols do not specify how to prioritize\nthe EPR pairs and unserved requests, but such prioritization\nimpacts ﬁdelity and latency. In this section, we apply the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method to process entanglement requests,\ni.e., the oldest request is the ﬁrst to serve. Regarding the order\nof EPR pairs, we consider two methods: Oldest-Qubit-First\n(OQF) and youngest-Qubit-First (YQF), which use the oldest\nand youngest qubit for entanglement swapping, respectively.All the protocols discard EPR pairs when their ﬁdelities fall\nbelow a preset threshold.\nEach time slot is 1 μs long. The number of entanglement\nrequests between any two end nodes iandjin a time slot is\ngiven by a mixture of two Poisson distributions with different\nrates. Speciﬁcally, A\nij(t)is i.i.d over time and given by\nAij(t)= Z·Y1+( 1− Z)·Y2\nwhere Zis a Bernoulli random varable with mean 1/2,a n d Y1\nandY2are independent Poisson random variables with mean\nλ1andλ2.\nB. Performance Analysis\nIn this subsection, unless otherwise speciﬁed, the number of\nmemory slots is 100 per interface and the entanglement swap-\nping probability q=0.9. The channels between the switch\nand end nodes are lossy optical ﬁbers, and the entanglement\ngen\n0.9. The channels between the switch\nand end nodes are lossy optical ﬁbers, and the entanglement\ngeneration probability p=0.9is the same for all interfaces.\nNote that p=0.9corresponds to a distance between the switch\nand end nodes of 2.3 km given a ﬁber attenuation coefﬁcientof 0.2 dB/km.\n5The qubits suffer from dephasing noise [29]\n5When p=0.9(i.e., the distance between the switch and end nodes is\n2.3 km), the link level entanglement rate is 0.9 EPR pair per μs. This is\nreasonable since ideally photon sources can emit photons at the rate of 107\nHz, corresponding to 10 EPR pairs per μs.when staying idle in memory slots, and the T2 time for thedephasing noise in each memory slot is set to 1 millisecond.\nSpeciﬁcally, the dephasing noise model in a memory slot is\nmodelled as follows:\nN\ndephase :ρ→(1−pdephase )ρ+pdephase σZρσZ\nwhere ρis the density matrix of a qubit, σZ=|0/angbracketright/angbracketleft0|−|1/angbracketright/angbracketleft1|\nis one of the Pauli operators, and pdephase is the dephasing\nprobability, given by\npdephase =1\n2(1−exp{−Δ t/T 2})\nin which Δtdenotes the time that a qubit stays idle in the\nmemory slot.

The\nnumber of interfaces is K=5 . Tables II and III show the\nperformance of the developed protocols for λij=0.2/μs\nandλij=0.12/μ s,∀i, j∈K , respectively. First, the on-\ndemand protocols and stationary protocols perform similarly in\nterms of ﬁdelity. Regarding latency, the on-demand protocols\nperform the best in most cases. Note that the on-demand\nprotocol does not require any statistical knowledge of the\nrequests or the systems, and that it involves low computational\noverhead. Therefore, the on-demand protocol is a desirablechoice in practice. Second, the average ﬁdelities of the YQF\nprotocols are much higher than those of the OQF protocols,\nbut the average latencies are g enerally greater than those of\nthe OQF protocols, especially when λ\nijis small. This agrees\nwith intuition. YQF tends to use newly generated EPR pairs forentanglement swapping, so the ﬁdelities are higher. Moreover,\nsince the EPR pairs are discarded when their ﬁdelities are\nlow, more EPR pairs are discarded when YQF is used. Sincefewer EPR pairs are used, latencies increase.

In these two ﬁgures, we set/summationtext\ni,jλij=1.2/μs.\nForK=8 , the average ﬁdelity and average latency decrease\nwith memory size; for K=4 , the average ﬁdelity and average\nlatency remain constant. This is because for K=4 ,t h e\nrates (λij)1≤i\ne average ﬁdelity and average\nlatency remain constant. This is because for K=4 ,t h e\nrates (λij)1≤i,j≤4lie outside the capacity region. The quantum\nswitch is then unstable, leading t o high latencies. Since there\nare many unserved entanglement requests, most of the time\nthe generated qubits between the switch and end nodes are\nused immediately for entanglement swapping, and this leadsto a ﬁdelity close to one. For K=8 ,t h er a t e s (λ\nij)1≤i,j≤8\nlie inside the capacity region. In many occasions, there areno unserved entanglement requests, and qubits in the memory\nsuffer from decoherence. An increase in memory slots results\nin qubits staying in the memory longer before consumed,leading to a decrease in ﬁdelity. In addition, more memory\nslots imply that the quantum switch discards fewer EPR pairs\nand therefore reduces latency.\nFigures 4 and 5 respectively show average ﬁdelity and\nlatency of the quantum switch achieved by the on-demandprotocols (YQF and OQF) as functions of the entanglement\nswapping success probability q. In these two ﬁgures, we set/summationtext\ni,jλij=2/μs. First, ﬁdelity initially decreases with q\nand then remains constant. This is because for small q,t h e\nrates are outside the capacity region, and the generated qubits\nbetween the switch and end nodes are used immediately for\nentanglement swapping, leading to ﬁdelities close to one. As\nqincreases, the rates gradually move into the capacity region,\nand some qubits stay in the memory before being consumed\nfor entanglement swapping, leading to a decrease in ﬁdelity.\nWhen qis sufﬁciently large, the memory slots are full most\nof the time, and increasing qdoes not signiﬁcantly improve\nthe memory occupancy rate. In these occasions, the averageﬁdelity does not change with q.

The reasoning\nfor this behavior is almost the same as that for ﬁdelity. Third,one observes that the sudden change of ﬁdelity and latency\noccurs around q=0.33 forK=8 and q=0.67 for\nK=4 . These two points exactly correspond to the boundary\npoints for the capacity region. This shows that the switchdemonstrate entirely different behavior inside or outside thecapacity region, which is consistent with the stability analysis\nin earlier sections. This ﬁgure also shows that if qcorresponds\nto a boundary point of the capacity region, increasing q\nprovides limited perfo rmance improvement.\nVIII. C\nONCLUSION\nWe develop efﬁcient entanglement swapping protocols for\na quantum switch and analyze their performance in terms ofstability of the switch, ﬁdelity of EPR pairs and latency of\nentanglement requests. We determine the capacity region for\nentanglement rates under the assumption of inﬁnite memory\nsize and inﬁnite qubit lifetime.

The performan ce of the developed protocols\nis evaluated using NetSquid, and practical constraints such as\ndecoherence in memory slots are accounted for. We show\nthat stationary protocols and on-demand protocols exhibit\nhigh ﬁdelity and low latency. Moreover, the tradeoff b\nary protocols and on-demand protocols exhibit\nhigh ﬁdelity and low latency. Moreover, the tradeoff betweenmemory size, decoherence rate, ﬁdelity, and latency shown inthe simulation results offer guidance in the implementation of\nquantum switches.\nA potential future direction is the design and analysis of\nswitches with a ﬁnite memory size and ﬁnite lifetime. Note\nthat in this manuscript, simulation results are obtained in\npractical scenarios, whereas the stability analysis is based on\nthe assumptions that the switch has sufﬁciently many memoryslots and that qubits have inﬁnite lifetime when stored in the\nmemory. The capacity region for a ﬁnite memory size and\nlifetime must be different, and the entanglement swapping\nprotocols must be des igned accordingly.\nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors thank Philippe Nain for his helpful suggestions\nand careful reading of the manuscript.\nAPPENDIX I\nSKETCH OF THE PROOF FOR THEOREM 3\nWe consider a random event S(t)deﬁned as follows:\nS(t)=/braceleftBig/summationdisplay\ni∈K/bracketleftbig\nUij(t)+ Aij(t)/bracketrightbig\n≤E0j(t)+ C0j(t),∀j∈K/bracerightBig\n(25)\nWhen the event S(t)occurs, then the quantum switch has\nsufﬁcient entanglement to address the entanglement request,\ni.e.,Fij≥Uij(t),i, j∈K when an on-demand protocol is\nused.Lemma 1: Under Assumption 1, if an on-demand protocol\nis used, then there exists a constant c2irrelevant of t,s u c h\nthat for any ˜i,˜j∈K\nE/bracketleftBigt/summationdisplay\nτ=0A˜i˜j(τ)|\nS(t)/bracketrightBig\nP/bracketleftbig\nS(t)/bracketrightbig\n≤c2.

In recent years, an analogous architecture\nhas emerged for quantum networks with optically\ndistributed entanglement [3, 4] between remote\nsuperconducting quantum processors, a leading\nplatform for quantum computing [5–7]. Here we\nreport an important milestone towards such net-\nworks by observing non-classical correlations be-\ntween photons in an optical link and a supercon-\nducting electrical circuit. We generate such states\nof light through a spontaneous parametric down-\nconversion (SPDC) process in a chip-scale piezo-\noptomechanical transducer [8]. The non-classical\nnature of the emitted light is veriﬁed by observ-\ning anti-bunching in the microwave state condi-\ntioned on detection of an optical photon. Such\na transducer can be readily connected to a su-\nperconducting quantum processor, and serve as a\nkey building block for optical quantum networks\nof microwave frequency qubits.\nNetworks of remotely situated qubits [3, 4] are essen-\ntial to harness quantum cor\nfrequency qubits.\nNetworks of remotely situated qubits [3, 4] are essen-\ntial to harness quantum correlations for long-distance se-\ncure communication [9, 10], distributed quantum com-\nputation [11, 12] and precision measurements [13, 14].\nOptical photons are naturally suited to act as ﬂying\nqubits over room temperature links and distribute en-\ntanglement in such networks [15]. Quantum optical net-\nworks with few nodes have been realized with systems\nsuch as atoms [16, 17], quantum dots [18, 19], trapped\nions [20], and color centers [21], which naturally pos-\nsess optical frequency transitions between their internal\nenergy levels. In parallel developments, superconduct-\ning circuits based on Josephson junctions have emerged\nas a leading platform for quantum information process-\ning with the ability to realize entangled states of many\nqubits in microwave frequency circuits [5–7]. However,\n∗These authors contributed equally\n†opainter@caltech.edu; http://copilot.caltech.edusuperconducting qubits do not possess a natural, coher-\nent interface with optical photons. This limitation has\nmotivated recent eﬀorts to develop transducers capable\nof generating quantum correlations between optical pho-\ntons and microwave frequency qubits. While schemes to\nproduce such states are fundamentally well-understood,\npreserving fragile quantum correlations during the trans-\nduction process has not been possible so far in a wide\nvariety of physical platforms [22–27]. This roadblock is\nprimarily due to technical challenges posed by the vast\ndiﬀerence in energy scales between microwave and optical\nphotons.\nHere we demonstrate non-classical microwave-optical\nphoton pairs from such a transducer. We use a piezo-\noptomechanical device in which an acoustic mode acts\nas an intermediary between microwave and optical ﬁelds.\nFirst, a pump laser pulse generates photon-phonon pairs\nin an optomechanical cavity via an SPDC process. Sub-\nsequently, a strong piezoelectric interaction converts the\nphonon i\ncavity via an SPDC process. Sub-\nsequently, a strong piezoelectric interaction converts the\nphonon into a microwave photon. To characterize the\nphoton pairs emitted by the transducer, we simultane-\nously perform single photon detection of the optical com-\nponent and heterodyne detection of the microwave com-\nponent. For experimental trials in which single opti-\ncal photons are detected, we compute the normalized\nsecond order intensity correlation function of the con-\nditional microwave state. Observation of a value below\nunity for this function constitutes direct veriﬁcation of\nnon-classical statistics of the photon pairs. Compared\nwith a recent demonstration of microwave-optical two-\nmode squeezing [28], our experiment demonstrates the\nrequisite techniques to implement the well-known DLCZ\nprotocol [10], which uses detection of optical photons to\nherald entanglement between distant nodes in quantum\nnetworks.\nOur result is primarily enabled by fabricating nearly all\ncircuit components of a chip-scale piezo-optomechanical\ntransducer from niobium nitride (NbN), a superconduc-\ntor in which quasiparticles (QPs) generated by optical\nabsorption relax on the timescale of a few nanoseconds\n[29]. Compared with our previous work in which we di-\nrectly coupled such a transducer to a transmon qubit on\nthe same chip [30], using a circuit with fast QP relaxationarXiv:2303.17684v1  [quant-ph]  30 Mar 20232\nallows us to mitigate the eﬀects of parasitic absorption\nof stray optical pump light by superconducting compo-\nnents of the transducer. In particular, we add well below\none quantum of noise to the circuit during transduction\nwhile increasing the rate of probabilistic optical detec-\ntion events by two orders of magnitude. While supercon-\nductors with fast QP relaxation have been employed in\npiezo-optomechanical transducers recently [31, 32], these\ndemonstrations were limited to classical states of light.\nOur device design and optical detection setup provide\nthe eﬃciency and noise \nsical states of light.\nOur device design and optical detection setup provide\nthe eﬃciency and noise levels required to observe non-\nclassical correlations.\nFigure 1a shows a conceptual schematic highlighting\nthe resonator modes involved in our transduction ex-\nperiment. Interaction between an optical mode, ˆ aand\na microwave-frequency acoustic mode, ˆbis mediated by\na pump laser driving an optomechanical cavity in the\nresolved sideband regime. Simultaneously, the acous-\ntic mode is resonantly coupled to a microwave-frequency\nelectrical mode, ˆ cvia the piezoelectric eﬀect. We can\nwrite the Hamiltonian for this system as\nˆH//planckover2pi1=−∆aˆa†ˆa+ωbˆb†ˆb+ωcˆc†ˆc+ˆHom//planckover2pi1+ˆHpe//planckover2pi1(1)\nHereωb,ωcare the frequencies of the modes ˆb,ˆcrespec-\ntively and ˆHom,ˆHpeare the optomechanical and piezo-\nelectric interaction Hamiltonians described in more de-\ntail below. ∆ a=ωp−ωais the diﬀerence between the\nfrequency of the optical pump, ωpand that of the opti-\ncal mode,ωa. Setting the frequency of the pump laser\nto be red (∆ a\u003C0) or blue detuned (∆ a\u003E0) with\nrespect to the optical cavity resonance allows us to se-\nlect either beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interac-\ntions, respectively [33]. The ﬁrst setting can be used\nto transfer states between the acoustic mode and the\noptical mode when the transducer is operated as a fre-\nquency converter [30, 32, 34]. In this work, we use the\nlatter setting to generate non-classical pairs of optical\nphotons and acoustic phonons in an SPDC process. This\nchoice is motivated by recent proposals for heralded re-\nmote entanglement generation which indicate that oper-\nation in SPDC mode relaxes the eﬃciency requirements\nfor piezo-optomechanical transducers [8, 35, 36]. In this\nsetting, we have ˆHom//planckover2pi1=−Gom(t)(ˆa†ˆb†+ ˆaˆb). The\ntime-dependent optomechanical coupling rate Gom(t) =/radicalbig\nna(t)gomis controlled parametrically via the intra-\ncavity photon population na(t) due to the detuned pump\nlaser. He\nolled parametrically via the intra-\ncavity photon population na(t) due to the detuned pump\nlaser. Here gomdenotes the optomechanical coupling rate\nat the single optical photon and acoustic phonon level.\nThe piezoelectric interaction is described by the beam-\nsplitter Hamiltonian ˆHpe//planckover2pi1=−gpe(ˆb†ˆc+ˆbˆc†). Here\ngpedenotes the piezoelectric coupling rate at the sin-\ngle microwave photon and acoustic phonon level. This\ninteraction can be used to map the acoustic compo-\nnent of the optomechanical two-mode squeezed state onto\nthe microwave electrical mode. In the absence of any\nadded noise, the joint state of the modes, ˆ a,ˆccan be de-\nscribed in the photon number basis by the wavefunction|ψ/angbracketright=|00/angbracketright+√p|11/angbracketright+p|22/angbracketright+O(p3/2). For a weak pump\nﬁeld, the higher order terms may be neglected, and the\ntransducer emits single optical and microwave photons\nin pairs with probability, p/lessmuch1. Detection of a single\noptical photon can then be used to conditionally prepare\nor herald a single microwave photon.\nFigure 1b shows the physical schematic of our de-\nvice, which consists of a half-wavelength superconduct-\ning kinetic inductance resonator [37] coupled to a piezo-\noptomechanical transducer. The transducer itself com-\nprises a half-wavelength aluminum nitride (AlN) piezo-\nacoustic cavity attached to a silicon optomechanical crys-\ntal (OMC) resonator via an acoustic waveguide [30]. We\nachieve piezoelectric coupling in our system by using the\ntwo end terminals of the microwave resonator as electri-\ncal leads over the AlN section of the transducer. The\nmicrowave resonator is patterned in a disordered, thin\nﬁlm of NbN in a meandering ladder geometry. The inclu-\nsion of closed loops in the thin superconducting ﬁlm, as\nshown in Fig. 1c, allows for tuning of kinetic inductance,\nand hence tuning of the frequency of the microwave res-\nonator via an external magnetic ﬁeld [38]. Using narrow\nsuperconducting wires in a \ne microwave res-\nonator via an external magnetic ﬁeld [38]. Using narrow\nsuperconducting wires in a meandering geometry results\nin high impedance, which helps us achieve strong piezo-\nelectric coupling, gpewith a small acoustic mode volume\n[39]. This design strategy is followed to maximize the\nfraction of acoustic energy in silicon, which has the low-\nest acoustic loss in our material stack. The NbN res-\nonator is capacitively coupled to a 50Ω transmission line\n(not shown in schematic) to facilitate microwave spec-\ntroscopy of the transducer. Likewise, the optical cavity\nis coupled to a waveguide, which terminates in a tapered\ncoupler at the edge of the chip allowing for eﬃcient cou-\npling to a lensed optical ﬁber. The layout of our device\nis chosen to reduce optical ﬂux from stray pump light at\nthe microwave resonator. We use an ∼1 mm long opti-\ncal waveguide to physically separate the circuit section\nof the transducer from the optical coupler, where there is\nsigniﬁcant scattering of pump light. Additionally, we use\nextended electrical terminals to physically separate the\noptically sensitive current anti-node of the kinetic induc-\ntance resonator from the OMC, and reduce the impact\nof local pump scattering.\nOur experiments are carried out by mounting the\ntransducer chip on the mixing plate of a dilution refrig-\nerator. We initially perform optical and microwave spec-\ntroscopy to identify the frequencies of the internal trans-\nducer modes as well as the optomechanical and piezo-\nelectric coupling rates. For the device used in the exper-\niments that follow, we found an optical resonance at a\nwavelength λ= 1561.3 nm with critical coupling to the\nexternal waveguide, κe,a/2π=κi,a/2π= 650 MHz.

In Fig. 2b, we\nshow the corresponding microwave reﬂection spectrum of\nthis mode as we sweep a magnetic ﬁeld applied perpen-\ndicular to the sample. We observe an anti-crossing be-\ntween the microwave electrical resonator mode, which is\nidentiﬁed through its characteristic quadratic tuning re-\nsponse in an external magne\nmode, which is\nidentiﬁed through its characteristic quadratic tuning re-\nsponse in an external magnetic ﬁeld [39], and the acous-\ntic mode of the transducer. The minimum frequency\nsplitting between these two modes allows us to estimate\nthe piezoelectric coupling rate, gpe/2π= 800 kHz. The\nindependent linewidths of the modes are measured far\nfrom the anti-crossing and are found to be κi,b/2π= 150\nkHz for the microwave acoustic mode and κe,c/2π= 1.2\nMHz,κi,c/2π= 550 kHz for the microwave electrical res-\nonator mode. For the experiments that follow, we set\nthe external magnetic ﬁeld at the value corresponding\nto the minimum mode splitting of 2 gpe/2π= 1.6 MHz\nwhere both modes are maximally hybridized. This cor-\nresponds to the condition, ωb=ωcin Eq. (1). In this set-\nting, we deﬁne the hybridized electromechanical modes,\nˆc±= (ˆb±ˆc)/√\n2 with frequencies, ω±=ωc±gpere-\nspectively. Even though the transducer supports other\nmicrowave-frequency acoustic modes as shown in Fig. 2a,\nthese are far detuned from the modes of interest, ˆ c±, rel-\native to the coupling rates, gpeandGom. As a result, we\nexpect the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) to provide a suﬃciently\naccurate description of our system.\nWe operate the transducer in SPDC mode by exciting\nit with optical pump pulses at the blue optomechanical\nsideband of the optical cavity (∆ a= (ω++ω−)/2). In\nthe experiments described below, Gaussian pump pulses\nof full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) duration, Tp=\n160 ns with a peak power corresponding to intra-cavity\noptical photon occupation, na= 0.8 were sent to the de-\nvice at a repetition rate of 50 kHz. Each pulse represents\nan experimental trial with a ﬁnite probability of gener-\nating a microwave-optical photon pair. Figure 3a shows\na schematic of the setup used to characterize the optical\nand microwave emission from the transducer under these\nconditions. The optical emission in the mode, ˆ aout, is\nsent to a superconducting nanowire single photon detec-\ntor (SNSPD) after passing thro\ne, ˆ aout, is\nsent to a superconducting nanowire single photon detec-\ntor (SNSPD) after passing through a Fabry-Perot ﬁlter\nsetup to suppress the pump pulses reﬂected by the trans-\nducer. In Fig. 3b, we show the optical photon ﬂux at the\nSNSPD obtained by averaging single photon ‘clicks’ over\nmultiple trials of the experiment. Gating the detection\nevents in a time window of duration, 2 Tp= 320 ns shown\nby the gray shaded region, we obtain a click probability,\npclick= 2.7×10−6, which leads to an optical heralding\nrate,Rclick= 0.14 Hz. A detailed account of various con-\ntributions to this heralding rate is provided in Ref. [39].\nIn parallel with optical photon detection, the mi-\ncrowave emission from the transducer in the output\nmode, ˆcoutis sent to a heterodyne detection setup as\nshown in Fig. 3a.

Emis-\nsion from the transducer modes ˆ c±is concentrated in a\nsmall bandwidth about the frequencies ω±within ˆsout.We isolate this signal by integrating the recorded het-\nerodyne voltage signal with a matched emission enve-\nlope function f(t) as detailed in the supplementary in-\nformation [39]. This corresponds to a measurement of\nthe quadratures of the temporal mode ˆS(t) :=/integraltext\nˆsout(t+\nt/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/primeat the output of the heterodyne detection\nsetup. Similarly, we deﬁne ˆC(t) :=/integraltext\nˆcout(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime\nand ˆH(t) :=/integraltextˆhout(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/primeto be temporal modes\ncorresponding to emission referred to the output port\nof the transducer device and ampliﬁer noise. As a\nconsequence of the large bandwidth of the pump pulse\ncompared to the mode splitting ( ηTB/Tp= 2.75 MHz\n\u003E2gpe/2π= 1.6 MHz, where ηTB= 0.44 is the time-\nbandwidth product of a Gaussian pulse) we cannot in-\ndividually resolve emission coming from ˆ c±. With this\nin mind,f(t) is constructed to capture emission from\nboth ˆc±, and consequently the temporal modes have large\nspectral overlap with both hybridized modes ˆ c±. By\nmeasuring the heterodyne voltage signal in experimental\ntrials carried in the presence (absence) of optical pump\npulses, we collect complex-value\nperimental\ntrials carried in the presence (absence) of optical pump\npulses, we collect complex-valued voltage samples of ˆS\n(ˆH†). These voltage samples are then used to calculate\nthe moments of the microwave ﬁeld, ¯Cmn=/angbracketleftˆC†mˆCn/angbracketright\nby taking an ensemble average over the experimental\ntrials and inverting the ampliﬁer input-output relations\n[39, 41]. For m=n= 1, we obtain the microwave in-\ntensity shown by the red time trace in Fig. 3c. Since\nthe SPDC excitation probability in our experiment is far\nless than unity, this signal is nearly entirely noise added\nfrom heating of the hybridized electromechanical modes\ndue to parasitic absorption of pump light. Further, the\ndecay of this added noise exhibits fast and slow compo-\nnents relative to the repetition rate of our experiment.\nIn particular, the slow component is responsible for the\nnon-zero microwave intensity prior to the optical pulse.\nDetailed measurements of the heating dynamics of the\ntransducer are presented in Ref. [39].\nTo measure microwave-optical cross-correlations, we\nperform conditional microwave readout by triggering\nthe heterodyne measurement based on the occurrence\nof an optical click in an experimental trial. Follow-\ning the same inversion process used for the uncondi-\ntional microwave ﬁeld, we can obtain the moments of\nthe microwave ﬁeld conditioned on optical detection,\n¯Cmn|click=/angbracketleftˆA†ˆC†mˆCnˆA/angbracketright//angbracketleftˆA†ˆA/angbracketright. Here, ˆArefers to the\ntemporal mode deﬁned by gating the optical waveguide\nmode, ˆaoutin the time window indicated by the gray\nshaded region in Fig. 3b. The result for m=n= 1\nis shown by the purple time trace in Fig. 3c. We ob-\nserve that detection of an optical photon is correlated\nwith substantially higher microwave intensity than that\nof the unconditional state. The temporal shape of the\nconditional signal is in good agreement with the result of\na numerical simulation of our system [39].\nDividing the conditional \nod agreement with the result of\na numerical simulation of our system [39].\nDividing the conditional and unconditional microwave\nintensity traces recorded in Fig. 3c, we obtain the normal-\nized microwave-optical intensity cross-correlation func-6\ntion,\ng(2)\nAC(τ) =/angbracketleftˆA†ˆC†(τ)ˆC(τ)ˆA/angbracketright\n/angbracketleftˆA†ˆA/angbracketright/angbracketleftˆC†(τ)ˆC(τ)/angbracketright(2)\nIn Fig. 3d, we plot this function sampled at three rep-\nresentative time delays as indicated by vertical dashed\nlines in Fig. 3c. τois the delay corresponding to the\nmaximum conditional microwave intensity, ¯C11|click, and\nτ±=τo±800 ns are oﬀset from τoin opposite direc-\ntions by ﬁve times the FWHM duration of the optical\npump pulse. We measure g(2)\nAC(τo) = 3.90+0.093\n−0.093, indicat-\ning strongly correlated microwave and optical emission at\nthis time delay. The error bars for this observation and\nsubsequent correlation functions referred to in the text\nare determined via a bootstrapping procedure over the\ndataset of heterodyne voltage samples [39], and represent\na conﬁdence interval spanning two standard deviations\nabout the mean. We observe that the microwave-optical\ncorrelations disappear at times well before and after the\noptical pump pulse as evinced by the near-unity values\nofg(2)\nAC(τ+) = 1.00+0.08\n−0.08andg(2)\nAC(τ−) = 0.94+0.27\n−0.27.\nFor classical microwave-optical states, g(2)\nACis bounded\nby a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, g(2)\nAC≤/radicalBig\ng(2)\nAAg(2)\nCC[42–\n44]. Here, g(2)\nAAandg(2)\nCCare the normalized intensity\nautocorrelation functions of the unconditional optical\nand microwave temporal modes, ˆAand ˆCrespectively,\nand are deﬁned in a manner similar to Eq. (2). Us-\ning the moment inversion procedure with the uncon-\nditional microwave voltage samples, we have measured\ng(2)\nCC=¯C22/(¯C11)2= 1.91+0.14\n−0.14atτ=τo. This is con-\nsistent with the theoretically expected value of 2 for a\nthermal state. An explicit measurement of g(2)\nAAwith\nour current device is impracti\nalue of 2 for a\nthermal state. An explicit measurement of g(2)\nAAwith\nour current device is impractical given the low coinci-\ndence rate expected in a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss mea-\nsurement. In principle, since optomechanical scatter-\ning from an acoustic mode in a thermal state is ex-\npected to produce g(2)\nAA= 2, we expect the classical upper\nbound,g(2)\nAC≤2. Our observation that g(2)\nAC(τo) exceeds\nthis classical bound for thermal states by over twenty\nstandard deviations serves as a promising signature of\nnon-classical statistics of the microwave-optical states.\nFurther, by performing this cross-correlation experiment\nwith increasing pump power, which is accompanied by\nincreasing thermal noise in the modes, we observe that\ng(2)\nAC(τo) monotonically approaches the value of 2 [39].\nTo unambiguously verify the non-classical nature of\nthe microwave-optical photon pairs, we measure the nor-\nmalized second order intensity correlation function of\nthe microwave state conditioned on an optical click,g(2)\nCC|click=¯C22|click/(¯C11|click)2. For noiseless SPDC in\nthe weak pump regime, we expect g(2)\nCC|click = 0 with\nthe detection of an optical photon heralding a pure sin-\ngle photon in the microwave mode. In practice, the\nvalue ofg(2)\nCC|clickwill be higher due to noise added dur-\ning transduction. Classical microwave-optical states are\nexpected to satisfy the inequality, g(2)\nCC|click≥1 [39].\nViolation of this inequality signiﬁes the observation of\nphoton anti-bunching in the conditionally prepared mi-\ncrowave state. With the conditional heterodyne volt-\nage samples collected in our experiment, we observe\ng(2)\nCC(τo)|click= 0.42+0.27\n−0.28. As shown in Fig. 3e, this ob-\nservation is below the classical bound of unity by 2.1\nstandard deviations. This corresponds to a probability\nof 1.7% for the null hypothesis of conditional prepara-\ntion of a classical microwave state. Details of the data\nanalysis and the underlying probability distribution of\ng(2)\nCC(τo)|clickare provided in \nf the data\nanalysis and the underlying probability distribution of\ng(2)\nCC(τo)|clickare provided in the supplementary informa-\ntion [39]. We emphasize that all the normalized correla-\ntion functions referred to in the text are, by deﬁnition, in-\ndependent of the gain, Gof the ampliﬁcation chain in the\nmicrowave heterodyne measurement. As a result, even\nthough the values of the moments, ¯Cmnand ¯Cmn|click\ndepend on the absolute accuracy of the calibrated gain,\nour inferences of non-classical statistics are based on nor-\nmalized correlation functions, which do not require this\ncalibration.\nThe non-classical photon pairs generated from our\ntransducer can be used to entangle distant quantum cir-\ncuits by adopting the DLCZ protocol [10]. Following\nthis scheme, interference of optical photons from two dis-\ntant transducers and subsequent single photon detection\ncan be used to herald entanglement between remote mi-\ncrowave nodes [45]. In this work, by conditionally prepar-\ning non-classical microwave states using detection of op-\ntical photons, we demonstrate both a capable transducer\ndevice and key experimental techniques for such a remote\nentanglement scheme. Towards entanglement of remote\nquantum processors, the microwave emission from our\ntransducer chip can be routed and eﬃciently absorbed\nin a superconducting qubit [46] residing in a separate\nprocessor module [23]. The use of a stronger piezoelec-\ntric material such as lithium niobate in our transducer\n[31, 32] would improve the electromechanical conversion\neﬃciency, and thereby, mitigate the primary microwave\nloss channel in our experiment. Transducer heating due\nto optical absorption can be reduced through better ther-\nmalization of the acoustic mode with the substrate [47],\nthereby improving the ﬁdelity of the photon pair for\na given emission rate. Finally, the strongly hybridized\nelectromechanical modes in our transducer provide two\nfrequency bins to encode a qubit in both the optical\nand microwave emission and c\nsducer provide two\nfrequency bins to encode a qubit in both the optical\nand microwave emission and can allow the generation of\nmicrowave-optical Bell states [8].7\n[1] Q.

DEVICE FABRICATION PROCESS\nThe fabrication process for the transducer chip is illus-\ntrated in Fig. S1 and described in the caption. Masks for\nall steps are patterned in ZEP-520A resist via electron-\nbeam lithography on a Raith EBPG 5200 tool. All dry\netching is performed in Oxford Plasmalab 100 inductive\ncoupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP RIE) tools.\nThe process ﬂow can be sub-divided into sections used\nto deﬁne various portions of the transducer device. Steps\n∗These authors contributed equally\n†opainter@caltech.edu; http://copilot.caltech.edu(i)-(vi) complete the deﬁnition of the AlN box essential\nfor the piezoacoustic cavity. The combination of dry and\nwet etch steps ensures that the dimensions of the AlN\nbox are precisely deﬁned while the silicon device layer is\nundamaged on most of the chip. This is important to\nachieve op\nned while the silicon device layer is\nundamaged on most of the chip. This is important to\nachieve optical, mechanical, and microwave modes with\nhigh quality factors. Steps (vii)-(ix) deﬁne the NbN res-\nonator and step (x) deﬁnes the OMC. Steps (xi)-(xiii) are\nuse to deﬁne aluminum electrodes on the piezo-resonator\nand galvanically connect them to the NbN resonator us-\ning bandage steps. The bandaid steps involve in situ Ar\nmilling for two minute and six minute durations respec-\ntively to clear the surface of NbN and Al prior to Al\nbandaid evaporation. To provide optical ﬁber access to\ncoupler sections at the end of the silicon photonic waveg-\nuides, we clear a portion of the SOI substrate up to a\ndepth of 150 µm using a deep reactive ion etch at the\nedge of the chip. Finally, the buried oxide (BOX) layer\nis etched in anhydrous vapor HF to release the device\nmembrane.\n3. MICROWAVE CIRCUIT DESIGN\nThe kinetic inductance resonator used in our trans-\nducer is fabricated from an NbN ﬁlm of 10 nm thick-\nness and 50 pH/sq sheet inductance. The meander-\ning ladder geometry described in the main text is com-\nprised of 2 µm×1µm rectangular loops formed from\ntraces of width 130 nm. We use extended electrical ter-\nminals of length 200 µm and width 1 µm to spatially\nseparate the high kinetic inductance section from the\nOMC. The resonator is designed to achieve a target fre-\nquency of 5.0 GHz for the fundamental mode with a ca-\npacitance, Cres= 7.1 fF, which includes a small con-\ntribution of 0.27 fF from the electrodes on the piezo-\nacoustic resonator. Nearly the entire inductance of the\nresonator mode is due to the kinetic inductance of the\nsuperconducting ﬁlm. The use of closed superconduct-\ning loops in the resonator allows for tuning of the ki-\nnetic inductance, Lk, via a DC supercurrent, I, induced\nby an external magnetic ﬁeld according to the relationarXiv:2303.17684v1  [quant-ph]  30 Mar 2023S2\nSiSiO2AlN\nSi(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi)\n...(vii) (viii) (ix)\n...(x)\n(xi) (xiv)\nt-ph]  30 Mar 2023S2\nSiSiO2AlN\nSi(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi)\n...(vii) (viii) (ix)\n...(x)\n(xi) (xiv) (xii) (xiii)Piezo box\nNbN resonator\n+ Si OMC\nAl IDT\n+ HF releaseNbN resonatorAr/Cl\ndry etchPECVD\nSiO2C4F8/SF6\ndry etchH3PO4\nwet etchBHF 10:1\nwet etch\nE-beam\nlithographyNbN\nsputteringSF6/Ar\ndry etchC4F8/SF6\ndry etch\nAl\nevaporation Bandaid 1 Bandaid 2Anhydrous HF\nvapor release\nFIG.

I∗/greatermuchIis a\ncharacteristic current on the order of the critical current\nof the nanowire [2]. This relation leads to quadratic tun-\ning of the resonator frequency in response to an external\nmagnetic ﬁeld as observed in Fig. 2b of the main text.\nThe resonator is capacitively coupled to an on-chip 50 Ω\ncoplanar waveguide (CPW) patterned in NbN to achieve\nan external coupling rate, κe,c/2π= 1.3 MHz. On the\nchip used for the experiments in this work, sixteen trans-\nducer devices were laid out in groups of four with eachgroup addressed by a separate CPW. Adjacent resonators\non the same CPW were designed to be detuned from each\nother by a frequency spacing of 100 MHz, much larger\nthan the cross-coupling, which was estimated to be less\nthan 1 MHz from simulation. This frequency multiplex-\ning approach allows us to increase the number of trans-\nducers available for testing on the chip while ensuring\nminimal microwave crosstalk.S3\n4. PIEZO-OPTOMECHANICS DESIGN\nThe piezo-optomechanical transducer in our work is re-\nalized by attaching a half-wavelength AlN piezo-acoustic\ncavity to a silicon OMC as shown in Fig. S2a. Fig-\nure S2b,c shows the optical and acoustic modes used for\ntransduction. The energy of the acoustic mode is split\nbetween the piezo-acoustic and OMC regions, which are\ndesigned independently to support acoustic resonances at\n5 GHz with large piezo-electric and optomechanical cou-\npling respectively. Similar to the device demonstrated in\n[3], hybridization of acoustic modes in these two portions\nis achieved through the connecting OMC section, whose\nband structure is designed to provide a bandgap for opti-\ncal photons and waveguiding for acoustic phonons at the\nfrequencies of interest. The primary diﬀerence compared\nto the previous design is the change to an ultra-low mode\nvolume piezo-acoustic cavity to reduce energy participa-\ntion in the piezo region, which is lossier for acoustics\nwhen c\nc cavity to reduce energy participa-\ntion in the piezo region, which is lossier for acoustics\nwhen compared to silicon. This design change is pos-\nsible without sacriﬁcing piezoelectric coupling since the\nimpedance of the kinetic inductance resonator is roughly\nan order of magnitude larger than that of the transmon\nqubit used in [3].\nFigures S2d,e show the hybridization of the piezo-\nacoustic and OMC modes via a sweep of the length of the\npiezo box. We observe strong hybridization of two dis-\ntinct branches that are piezo-like and OMC-like as high-\nlighted by the dashed lines with maximal hybridization\noccurring at a piezo length of 880 nm. On the trans-\nducer chip used in our experiments, we fabricate devices\nwith piezo length swept over a range of 20 nm about\nthis nominal value to compensate for fabrication disor-\nder. Clamping loss of the piezo-acoustic resonator is min-\nimized by using tethers with modulated width as shown\nin Figs. S2a,b. The tethers are designed to support a 1.5\nGHz wide acoustic bandgap centered around the trans-\nducer acoustic modes.\nThe OMC is evanescently coupled to a suspended sili-\ncon waveguide, which terminates in a coupler section at\nthe edge of the chip. We use a millimeter length scale\nwaveguide to distance the NbN circuit from scattering\nof pump light generated near the optical coupler sec-\ntion. The waveguide is designed with alternating curved\nsections in order to increase robustness against buckling\nfrom intrinsic stress in the silicon device layer. Adiabatic\ntethers are used to anchor the waveguide in order to re-\nduce scattering loss and maintain high optical collection\neﬃciency.\n5. MEASUREMENT SETUP\nThe measurement setup used in this work is detailed\nin Fig. S3. For SPDC experiments, trigger signals from a\nmaster digital delay generator are used to synchronize op-\ntical pump pulses with the timing window used for optical\nand microwave readout. Optical pump pulses with \u003E120dB extinction are generated using two analog acousto-\no\nrowave readout. Optical pump pulses with \u003E120dB extinction are generated using two analog acousto-\noptic modulators (G&H Photonics) and are routed via a\ncirculator into the ‘Optics in/out’ path towards the de-\nvice in the dilution fridge as shown in Fig.S3a. The op-\ntical emission from the device passes through the same\ncirculator and is directed to a pump ﬁltering setup prior\nto single photon detection (SPD) along the ‘SPD in’\npath in Fig. S3a. The ﬁltering setup comprises two tun-\nable Fabry–Perot ﬁlter cavities (Stable Laser Systems)\nin series and provides 104 dB extinction for a pump de-\ntuning of 5 GHz along with a transmission bandwidth\nof 2.7 MHz. This transmission bandwidth naturally\nexcludes emission due to optomechanical scattering by\nother transducer modes besides the two hybridized elec-\ntromechanical modes of interest, ˆ c±. During the exper-\niment, transmission through the ﬁlters is checked every\nfour minutes and a lock sequence is initiated if the trans-\nmission drops below a set threshold. At the beginning\nof the transmission check, the optical path is set to by-\npass the fridge via a MEMS switch. An electro-optic\nphase modulator ( φ-m in Fig. S3a) is used to generate\na sideband on the pump tone at the target frequency to\nwhich the ﬁlters are locked. In our SPDC experiments,\nthis target frequency corresponds to a pump detuning,\n∆a= (ω++ω−)/2. If required, the locking algorithm\nadjusts the ﬁlter cavities to maximize transmission at\nthe target frequency by monitoring the output of each\ncavity on a separate photodetector. Additionally, during\nlong measurements, we periodically monitor the polar-\nization of the pump light sent to the device and compen-\nsate for long term polarization drifts along the excitation\npath. Active polarization control is preformed by using\nan electronic polarization controller (Phoenix Photonics)\nand maximizing the optical pump power reﬂected by the\ndevice.\nOptical photon counting is achieved using a tungsten\nsilicide (WSi) sup\nower reﬂected by the\ndevice.\nOptical photon counting is achieved using a tungsten\nsilicide (WSi) superconducting nanowire single photon\ndetector (SNSPD) mounted on the still plate of the di-\nlution refrigerator (BlueFors LD-250) maintained at a\ntemperature of 770 mK. As shown in Fig. S3b, electri-\ncal pulses from the SNSPD generated by single optical\nphoton detection events are ampliﬁed and split into two\nseparate paths to record the detection time on a time\ncorrelated single photon counter (TCSPC) and to trigger\nmicrowave readout conditioned on an optical click. For\nconditional microwave readout, we ﬁrst generate a logi-\ncal bit for every optical click by performing a logic level\ntranslation of the SNSPD electrical pulse to a TTL sig-\nnal. We then perform a logical AND operation between\nthis ‘optical click bit’ and a trigger bit provided by the\nmaster delay generator deﬁning the duration of the op-\ntical gating window. On the other hand, unconditional\nmicrowave readout is triggered directly by the master\ndelay generator. An RF switch (MiniCircuits ZASWA-2-\n50DRA+) is used to switch between unconditional and\nconditional readout of the microwave output signal.\nThe microwave output chain shown along the ‘MW\nout’ path in Fig. S3c begins with a Josephson traveling-S4\n820 840 860 880 900 920 940\nPiezo length (nm)4.854.94.9555.055.15.15Frequency (GHz)\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7\ngOM /2π (MHz)\n820 840 860 880 900 920 940\nPiezo length (nm)4.854.94.9555.055.15.15Frequency (GHz)\n00.511.522.533.544.55\ngPE /2π(MHz)aluminum nitride\nacoustic \nwaveguideacoustic \nmirroracoustic shield\ntethers\ndefect regiona\nbd\nce\nDisplacement (a.u.)1 0\n-1 1\nEy (a.u.)aluminumsilicon\nFIG.

For TWPA operation, we use a CW pump tone\nat a frequency of ∼6.07 GHz added to the ampliﬁer in-\nput using a 20 dB directional coupler (not shown in the\nﬁgure). A dual junction circulator with 40 dB isolation\nis placed between the directional coupler and the sample\nto shield the transducer from back-reﬂected pump. The\nTWPA is followed by a high mobility electron transis-\ntor (HEMT, Low Noise Factory LNF-LNC4 8C) ampli-\nﬁer mounted on the 4K plate. In the setup outside the\nfridge as shown in Fig. S3b, we perform additional am-\npliﬁcation of the signal and ﬁltering of the TWPA pump\ntone using a tunable notch ﬁlter (Micro Lambda Wire-\nless MLBFR-0212). The microwave signal is then down-\nconverted to an intermediate frequency (IF) of ∼100 MHz\nafter mixing with a local oscillator on an IQ mixer (Marki\nIQ-4509). The I and Q outputs of the mixer are subse-\nquently bandpass-ﬁltered, ampliﬁed and recorded inde-\npendently on two channels of an analog to digital con-\nverter (ADC, Alazartech ATS 9360). These two digi-\ntized voltage signals correspond to measurement of thereal and imaginary quadratures of the output mode of the\nampliﬁcation chain, ˆ sout. Based on the calibrated gain\nof our ampliﬁcation chain, we measured that our hetero-\ndyne detection setup has an added noise of ∼2.5 quanta\nreferred to the output of the transducer at a signal fre-\nquency of∼5.0 GHz. This near-quantum-limited hetero-\ndyne readout enabled by the TWPA is a key enabler for\nmeasurements of microwave-optical correlations from our\nt\nt enabled by the TWPA is a key enabler for\nmeasurements of microwave-optical correlations from our\ntransducer on a reasonable experimental timescale. The\nsetup shown in Fig. S3b additionally allows for pulsed\nmicrowave excitation of the transducer as well as spec-\ntroscopy with a vector network analyzer (VNA).\nThe transducer sample is wire-bonded to a printed cir-\ncuit board (PCB) with coaxial connectors and is housed\nin an oxygen-free high thermal conductivity (OFHC)\ncopper package. The microwave resonance frequency of\nthe NbN resonators can be tuned by an external mag-\nnetic ﬁeld generated from an Nb-Ti coil mounted over the\nsample package.

S3. Experimental setup. a.Optical pulse synthesis and detection. An external cavity diode laser is wavelength locked to\na wavemeter, and a 50 MHz tunable narrowband ﬁlter is used to remove spontaneous emission noise. Optical pulse shaping is\nachieved by modulating the laser with two acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) connected in series. The envelope for the optical\npulses is generated by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). A variable optical attenuator (VOA) is used to adjust the optical\npower level sent to the device. Excitation of the device is performed via an optical circulator through which the device reﬂection\nan\nxcitation of the device is performed via an optical circulator through which the device reﬂection\nand emission can be routed to two separate paths to perform either continuous wave (CW) spectroscopy or pulsed single photon\ncounting. For CW spectroscopy, the reﬂected optical pump along with the optomechanically transduced signal is ampliﬁed with\nan erbium doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA) and detected on a high-speed photodetector. On the single photon counting path,\npump light is ﬁltered using two tunable Fabry–Perot ﬁlter cavities (Stable Laser Systems) before directing the optical signal to\nthe single photon detector (SPD) in the dilution fridge. b.Microwave pulse synthesis and detection. For measurements that\nrequire electrical excitation of the transducer, pulsed input signals to the fridge are generated at the intermediate frequency\n(IF) by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and subsequently upconverted to ∼5GHz on an IQ mixer. Likewise, for CW\nmicrowave spectroscopy, a vector network analyzer (VNA) may be switched into the setup. The microwave output from the\nfridge passes though a tunable bandstop ﬁlter to remove the TWPA pump tone, and is down-converted, ampliﬁed and ﬁltered\nbefore acquisition on an analog to digital converter (ADC). For unconditional microwave readout, the master delay generator\nfor the experiment generates the trigger signal for the ADC. For microwave readout conditioned on an optical click generated\nfrom SPDC, the trigger signal for the ADC is generated by performing a logical AND operation between optical click events\nfrom the SPD and a trigger bit from the master delay generator spanning the gating window for collection of the optical signal.\nc.Dilution refrigerator conﬁguration. The microwave (MW) input line contains attenuators on the 4K, cold, and mixing\nchamber plates for thermalization of the coaxial cables. The MW output line passes through an ampliﬁcation chain consisting\nof a Traveling-Wave Parametric Ampliﬁer (TWPA) mounted on the \nough an ampliﬁcation chain consisting\nof a Traveling-Wave Parametric Ampliﬁer (TWPA) mounted on the mixing plate and a High Electron Mobility Transistor\n(HEMT) ampliﬁer mounted on the 4K plate. The TWPA is driven by a strong pump tone sent along a separate line and\ninserted via a directional coupler placed before the ampliﬁer input (not shown). The superconducting nanowire single photon\ndetector (SNSPD) is mounted to the still plate and the electrical output signal is ampliﬁed on the 4K plate before being sent\nto room temperature electronics.\ncouplers. The entire assembly is enclosed in a cylindri-\ncal magnetic shield and is mounted to the mixing plate\nof the dilution refrigerator cooled to a base temperature\nTf≈20 mK.6. OPTICAL HERALDING RATE\nCONTRIBUTIONS\nThe optical heralding events in our SPDC experiments\nhave a ﬁnite noise contribution from pump-induced heat-\ning of the hybridized electromechanical modes as well as\ntechnical sources in our experimental setup, namely de-\ntector dark counts and pump laser leakage.

To determine the noise contribution from the\nthermal occupation of the acoustic mode, we perform a\nmeasurement of optomechanical sideband asymmetry [5].\nWe excite the transducer with the same pump pulse se-\nquence used in the SPDC experiment but with the pump\nlaser tuned to the red mechanical sideband of the opti-\ncal cavity (∆ a=−(ω++ω−)/2). The resultant photon\nﬂux from this measurement is shown by the red trace\nin Fig. S4a. Integrating the photon counts from these\nindependent measurements over the gating window, we\nobtain the contributions of each noise source to the total\nprobability of a heralding event, pclick= 2.7×10−6as\nshown in Fig. S4b. The corresponding fractional contri-\nbutions are enumerated in Tab. S2. Further, the diﬀer-\nence between the count rate under red and blue detuned\nlaser excitation allows us to infer an average thermal oc-\ncupation of 0 .097±0.019 for the acoustic mode over the\nduration of the optical gating window.7. MICROWAVE MOMENT INVERSION\nTo measure the statistical moments of the microwave\nemission from the transducer, we adopt the method origi-\nnally demonstrated in Ref. [6], which has been widely ap-\nplied to perform tomography of non-classical microwave\nradiation emitted by superconducting qubits [7–9]. The\nmicrowave signal emitted from the device undergoes a se-\nries of ampliﬁcation steps before a record is captured as\na digitized, complex-valued voltage signal on the hetero-\ndyne setup. This phase-insensitive ampliﬁcation chain\ninevitably adds noise and is model\nthe hetero-\ndyne setup. This phase-insensitive ampliﬁcation chain\ninevitably adds noise and is modelled as [10, 11],\nˆsout=√\nGˆcout+√\nG−1ˆh†, (1)\nwhere ˆcout, ˆsoutand ˆh†are the bosonic mode opera-\ntors corresponding to the transducer output, the hetero-\ndyne setup output and added noise respectively, with di-\nmensions of T−1/2. In the limit of large ampliﬁer gain\n(G/greatermuch1), this relation may be approximated as\nˆsout≈√\nG/parenleftBig\nˆcout+ˆh†/parenrightBig\n, (2)\nOnce recorded, we take the inner product of the het-\nerodyne traces with an emission envelope function, fin\nsoftware. A particular choice of the envelope function\ncorresponds to a measurement of the quadratures of the\ntemporal mode ˆS(t) :=/integraltext\nˆsout(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime. With this\nchoice Eq. (2) becomes,\nˆS≈√\nG/parenleftBig\nˆC+ˆH†/parenrightBig\n, (3)\nwhere ˆC(t) :=/integraltext\nˆcout(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/primeand ˆH(t) :=/integraltextˆh(t+\nt/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime. Note that ˆCis a temporal mode in the\noutput waveguide, not the internal microwave mode, ˆ c\nof the transducer. Thus from a sequence of Nhetero-\ndyne measurements, a dataset of complex voltage sam-\nples{S1,S2,...SN}is generated and the statistical mo-\nments are numerically calculated as [6, 11],\n¯Smn:=/angbracketleftˆS†mˆSn/angbracketright=1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1(S∗\ni)m(Si)n. (4)\nThe results in the main text require us to determine\nthe statistical moments of ˆC, which we organize into a\nmoments matrix with elements ¯Cmn=/angbracketleftˆC†mˆCn/angbracketright. This is\naccomplished using additional reference measurements in\nwhich the transducer is not optically pumped so that the\ninput to the ampliﬁer is a vacuum state. This reference\nmeasurement directly gives the anti-normally ordered\nmoments of the added noise as ¯Hmn:=/angbracketleftˆHmˆH†n/angbracketright=\n¯Smn/Gn+m\n2.\nWe experimentally veriﬁed that ¯Hmnis consistent with\na thermal state for m,n≤2.

Knowledge of the mean oc-\ncupancy (nth,H) of the state constitutes full knowledgeS7\nof the statistics for a thermal state. Accordingly, we ex-\ntractnth,Hfrom the reference measurements and calcu-\nlate ¯Hmnas [12],\n¯Hmn=/braceleftBigg\nm!(nth,H+ 1)mm=n,\n0 otherwise .(5)\nFinally, under the assumption that there are no corre-\nlations between ˆCand ˆH, Eq.

Performing\nsingle photon detection on the optical state coupled out\nof the cavity naturally allows us to discard the vacuum\ncomponent of|ψ/angbracketright. Further, we can neglect higher order\nterms,O(p) in the expansion since p/lessmuch1 for the optical\npump power level used in our experiments. In our exper-\niment, the SNSPD has nanosecond timing jitter, which\nis much smaller than the period of the beat note between\nthe modes ˆa±given by 2π/2gpe= 625 ns. As a result, de-\ntection of an SNSPD click in an experimental trial erases\nfrequency information of the optical state.

The large band-\nwidth of the pump pulse of 2.75 MHz in comparison\nto the mode splitting of 1.6 MHz means that the fre-\nquency bins cannot be individually well resolved in the\noptical emission. Further, given the splitting between\nthe frequency bins versus their individual linewidths of\n1.0 MHz, our device is not deep in the strong piezo-\nelectric coupling regime. This is evinced by the two\npeaks with ﬁnite overlap in the experimentally mea-\nsured power spectrum of the conditional microwave emis-\nsion,/angbracketleftˆc†\nout(ω)ˆcout(ω)/angbracketright|clickshown with the blue trace in\nFig. S5b. However, the theoretical pi\nt(ω)ˆcout(ω)/angbracketright|clickshown with the blue trace in\nFig. S5b. However, the theoretical picture discussed\nabove can guide the parametrization of the envelope func-\ntion used for microwave readout. Accordingly, we deﬁne\nthe microwave emission envelope function as a coherent\nsuperposition of two frequency bins centered at ω±,\nf(t) =g(t)√\n2/parenleftBig\ne−i(ω+t+φo/2)+e−i(ω−t−φo/2)/parenrightBig\n.(10)\nThe relative phase, φois assumed to be ﬁxed since the\noptical pulse duration used in our experiment is short\ncompared to the beat period between the frequency bins.\nThe function, g(t) accounts for the ﬁnite linewidth of the\nfrequency bins and is obtained by numerically solving theS8\nmaster equation for our system using the QuTiP software\npackage [14]. For this calculation, we use the Hamilto-\nnian in Eq. (1) of the main text along with experimentally\ndetermined coupling and decay rates for the transducer\nmodes. The resulting MW emission intensity is shown in\nFig. S5a.g(t) is parameterized as a skewed Gaussian to\ncapture the faster timescale of the rising edge relative to\nthe decay. The corresponding voltage envelope is given\nby the square root of a skewed Gaussian and is written\nas\ng(t) =1\n4/radicalBig\n2πT2gexp/parenleftbigg\n−t2\n4T2g/parenrightbigg/bracketleftBigg\n1 + erf/parenleftBigg\nαt√\n2Tg/parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg1/2\n,\n(11)\nup to a normalization factor involving the gain of the mi-\ncrowave ampliﬁcation chain. Here the Gaussian standard\ndeviation,Tg= 230 ns and skew factor, α= 2.0 are ob-\ntained from ﬁtting to the simulated result. We note that\nfor a microwave photon instantaneously loaded into the\nresonator,g(t) is expected to follow an exponential decay.\nHowever, in our transducer, due to the ﬁnite conversion\nrate of the phonon from SPDC into a microwave pho-\nton,g(t) has a ﬁnite rise time. As a result, we ﬁnd that\nchoosing the skewed Gaussian parametrization instead\nof an exponential decay provides ∼4% higher overlap\nbetween the emission envelope fun\nzation instead\nof an exponential decay provides ∼4% higher overlap\nbetween the emission envelope function and the simu-\nlated wavepacket as quantiﬁed by their normalized inner\nproduct. The power spectrum of the resultant envelope\nfunction,|f(ω)|2is shown as the orange trace in Fig. S5b.\nThis is observed to be well-matched to the power spec-\ntrum of the conditional microwave emission from the\ntransducer obtained from experimentally recorded het-\nerodyne voltage traces.\n9. MICROWAVE GAIN CALIBRATION\nWe calibrate the gain of our microwave heterodyne\ndetection setup by operating the transducer as a fre-\nquency converter with the optical pump laser on the red\nmechanical sideband. The calibration procedure is per-\nformed at zero magnetic ﬁeld, when the acoustic and mi-\ncrowave modes, ˆb,ˆcare detuned by a frequency separa-\ntion,ωb−ωc= 2π×12 MHz/greatermuch2gpeand are weakly hy-\nbridized. An independent measurement of optomechan-\nical sideband asymmetry provides a meter for phonon\noccupation in the acoustic mode, ˆbvia the single phonon\ncount rate, Ro[5]. We then resonantly excite the acoustic\nmode via the microwave port and measure the transduced\noptical photon count rate, R. Simultaneously, we record\nthe reﬂected microwave signal from the transducer, which\nproduces an output power, Pdetat the output of the het-\nerodyne setup. The gain, Gof the ampliﬁcation chain\ncan be determined using the series of equations below.R=nb,sigRo, (12)\nnb,sig/planckover2pi1ωb=Pin4κe,b\nκ2\ni,b, (13)\nPdet=G/parenleftbiggκe,b−κi,b\nκe,b+κi,b/parenrightbigg2\nPin.

Pinis the\ninput microwave power to the transducer. κb,eis the cou-\npling rate of the acoustic mode to the microwave waveg-\nuide due to weak hybridization with the microwave res-\nonator and κb,iis the intrinsic linewidth of the acoustic\nmode. Both rates are determined via a VNA measure\nand κb,iis the intrinsic linewidth of the acoustic\nmode. Both rates are determined via a VNA measure-\nment of the acoustic mode in the presence of the opti-\ncal pump pulses. Following this procedure, we estimate\ngain,G= 103 dB between the microwave output port of\nthe transducer and the output of the heterodyne setup.\nWhile knowledge of the gain allows us to estimate the mi-\ncrowave intensity at the transducer output, we note that\nthe values of the normalized correlation functions mea-\nsured in our experiment are independent of the absolute\naccuracy of this calibration.\n10. TWPA OPTIMIZATION\nThe operating point of the TWPA was optimized prior\nto data acquisition. In order to ensure fast acquisition\nand unbiased statistics, our operational criterion were\n(1) maximize the gain and (2) ensure linearity in the re-\nsponse. In our optimization procedure, the frequency and\npower of the pump tone driving the TWPA were swept,\nand coherent pulses with amplitude matched to the con-\nditional microwave signal in our experiment were sent to\nthe transducer input port. The result of the heterodyne\nmeasurement of the reﬂected signal from the transducer\nwas used to compute g(2)\nCC. To ensure linearity, we chose\na region in the TWPA pump frequency and power space\nwhereg(2)\nCC= 1 to within one standard deviation. The\nﬁnal operating point was then chosen as the one with\nmaximum gain from this cohort. Over the course of the\nexperiment, linearity of the TWPA was periodically ver-\niﬁed by measuring g(2)\nCCfor a weak coherent input. In\ncase of a deviation of g(2)\nCCfrom unity by one standard\ndeviation, the experiment was halted and the pump op-\ntimization routine was re-run.\n11. TRANSDUCER HEATING DYNAMICS\nTo investigate the heating dynamics of the transducer,\nwe performed a series of microwave measurements under\npulsed optical excitation. In Fig. S6a, we show the time-\nresolved power spectrum of the unconditional microwaveS9\nemission at the transducer output port. For this mea-\nsurement, we\n of the unconditional microwaveS9\nemission at the transducer output port. For this mea-\nsurement, we use the optical pulse sequence ( Tp= 160\nns, 50 kHz repetition rate) used in the SPDC experiments\nin the main text albeit at a higher pump power, na= 12,\nwhich generates higher thermal noise. We observe that\nmajority of the heating occurs in the emission bandwidth\nof the hybridized electro-mechanical modes. The peak of\nthis thermal emission is noticeably delayed from the op-\ntical pump pulse. Additionally, we observe a small but\nnon-zero noise contribution far from the transducer res-\nonances, which we attribute to heating of the microwave\nwaveguide. These resonator and waveguide contributions\nto the added noise are separated by ﬁtting the power\nspectrum at each delay to a double Lorentzian function\nwith a constant ﬂoor. The ﬁt result is shown in Fig. S6b,\nand indicates that resonator heating signiﬁcantly domi-\nnates waveguide heating and has a stronger time depen-\ndence. This points to parasitic optical absorption in the\nintrinsic baths of the acoustic and microwave modes as\nthe dominant source of transducer heating. Additionally,\nwe measured the scaling of the intensity of this thermal\nemission with optical pump power and observed it to be\nsub-linear as shown by the results plotted in Fig. S6c. Fi-\nnally, from the time dynamics of heating in Fig. S6a, we\nobserve that while most of the thermal emission decays\non the timescale of a few microseconds, a small compo-\nnent persists as steady state heating and is observed prior\nto the arrival of the optical pump pulse. We attribute\nthis to a slower component of the hot bath generated\nby optical absorption and characterize it by varying the\nrepetition rate of the optical pulses. The result shown in\nFig. S6d conﬁrms slow decay of this component of heat-\ning with an exponential decay time of 33 ±6µs. The\nmeasurements described in this section were performed\non the same device used for the SPDC experiments in the\nmain text, b\n in this section were performed\non the same device used for the SPDC experiments in the\nmain text, but after a partial warm up and cooldown to\nbase temperature. After this thermal cycle, we observed\nfrequency shifts of the microwave and acoustic modes by\na few MHz and an increase in the normal mode splitting.\nHowever, the thermal noise quanta generated by the op-\ntical pulse sequence used for the experiments in the main\ntext remained nearly the same.\n12.

(16c)\nWe have explicitly included the time dependence of the\noptomechanical coupling Gom(t) =/radicalbig\nna(t)gomdue to the\ntemporal shape of the intra-cavity pump photon number,\nna(t) =κe,a/(∆2\na+κ2\na/4)Pin(t).Pin(t), the optical pump\npower at the device follows a Gaussian shape with param-\neters described in the main text. In our experiment, we\nuse a blue detuned pump with ∆ a=ωb. Further, our\ndevice is in the sideband resolved regime with ωb/greatermuchκa.\nIn addition to unitary evolution due to couplings\namong the internal modes of the transducer, the system\nis also subject to dissipation and heating due to coupling\nto the environment. This is captured by the master equa-\ntion,\n˙ˆρ(t) =L(t)ˆρ(t).

(19c)\nHere the total dissipation rate of the optical mode, κa=\nκe,a+κi,a. To capture heating of the transducer modes\ndue to parasitic absorption of the optical pump, we as-\nsume that the acoustic and microwave modes are coupled\nto intrinsic baths with time dependent thermal occupa-\ntion,nth,b(t) andnth,c(t) respectively. nth,w, the ther-\nmal occupation of the microwave waveguide is set to a\nconstant value much smaller than nth,b(t) andnth,c(t)\nbased on the measurements detailed in Section 11. We\nnote that while these baths may be signiﬁcantly more\ncomplex and involve several components possessing dif-\nferent, time-dependent coupling strengths, our model is\naimed at capturing the total inﬂux of thermal excita-\ntions into the transducer modes generated by the optical\npulse. With this endeavor in mind, we assume that the\nacoustic (microwave) mode couples to a single intrinsicbath at a ﬁxed dissipation rate, κi,b(κi,c) and ascribe\nthe time-dependence of the heating dynamics entirely to\nthe thermal occupation of the bath. This phenomenolog-\nical approach to heating induced by optical absorption\nhas previously been used to model photon correlations in\noptomechanics experiments [15].\nWhile Eq. (17) can be numerically solved in princi-\nple, this is computationally intensive owing to the large\nstate space involving the three modes of the transducer.\nInstead, we take advantage of the fact that κa/greatermuchGom\nto adiabatically eliminate the optical mode [16]. Moving\ninto a frame rotating with the mechanical and microwave\nmodes and deﬁning the optomechanical s\noving\ninto a frame rotating with the mechanical and microwave\nmodes and deﬁning the optomechanical scattering rate,\nΓom(t) = 4|Gom(t)|2/κa, we arrive at the simpliﬁed mas-\nter equation,\n˙ˆρr(t) =Lr(t)ˆρr(t), (20)\nwhere ˆρr= Tra{ˆρ}denotes the reduced density matrix\nspanning only the acoustic and microwave modes. Lris\ndeﬁned by its action on the reduced density matrix,\nLr(t)ˆρr(t) =−i\n/planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig\nˆHpe,ˆρr(t)/bracketrightBig\n+ (Lom(t) +Lb(t) +Lc(t)) ˆρr(t),(21)\nwhere we have introduced optomechanical scattering as\na coupling of the reduced system to an eﬀective bath\naccording to the relation,\nLom(t)ˆρr(t) = Γ om(t)D(ˆb†)ˆρr(t). (22)\nThe Lindblad superoperator, D(ˆb†) contains a non-\nnumber preserving quantum jump operator which adds\na phonon to the system due to optomechanical SPDC.\nThis process is naturally correlated with the creation of\nan optical photon, which is routed with ﬁnite collection\neﬃciency to a single photon detector. Given that opti-\ncal decay ( κa/2π= 1.3 GHz) occurs on a much faster\ntimescale than the dynamics of the rest of the system\n(κa/greatermuchκb,gpe,κc), optical detection is assumed to be in-\nstantaneous. Under this approximation, in the event of a\nclick on the optical detector caused by a quantum jump\nat timetJ, the resultant conditional state of the reduced\nsystem is,\nˆρJ(tJ) =ˆb†ˆρr(tJ)ˆb\nTr/braceleftBig\nˆb†ˆρr(tJ)ˆb/bracerightBig. (23)\nThis state then evolves according to Eq. (20). Since\nwe operate in the weak pump regime where the inte-\ngrated jump probability over the optical pulse duration,/integraltext\nΓom(t)dt/lessmuch1, we neglect two-fold SPDC events.\nWhile the treatment above describes the evolution of\nthe internal modes of the transducer, we experimen-\ntally measure the emission in the temporal mode, ˆCin\nthe transducer microwave output port. This temporal\nmode is linearly related to the internal microwave mode\nof the transducer as ˆC(t) :=/integraltext\nˆcout(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime=S11\n√κe,c/integraltext\nf the transducer as ˆC(t) :=/integraltext\nˆcout(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime=S11\n√κe,c/integraltext\nˆc(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime. We can thus compute the oc-\ncupation of the temporal mode as\n/angbracketleftˆC†(t)ˆC(t)/angbracketright\n=κe,c/angbracketleft/integraldisplay\nˆc†(t+t/prime/prime)f(t/prime/prime)dt/prime/prime/integraldisplay\nˆc(t+t/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime/angbracketright\n=κe,c/integraldisplay\n/angbracketleftˆc†(t+t/prime/prime)ˆc(t+t/prime)/angbracketrightf(t/prime/prime)f∗(t/prime)dt/prime/primedt/prime\n=κe,c/integraldisplay\n/angbracketleftˆc†(t/prime+τ/prime)ˆc(t/prime)/angbracketrightf(t/prime+τ/prime−t)f∗(t/prime−t)dt/primedτ/prime,\n(24)\nwhere the correlator, /angbracketleftˆc†(t/prime+τ/prime)ˆc(t/prime)/angbracketrightinside the integral\non the ﬁnal line can be numerically computed using the\nquantum regression theorem [17]. Further, to model the\nconditional state due to a quantum jump at time tJ, this\ncorrelator is computed using ˆ ρJ(tJ) in Eq. (23) for times,\nt\u003Et J. For times t\u003Ct J, we use the value for the uncon-\nditional state. Performing this calculation for a sequence\nof jump times,{tJ}associated with detector clicks re-\nceived within the optical gating window, we obtain a\nsequence of conditional time traces for the occupation\nof the temporal mode, {/angbracketleftˆC†ˆC/angbracketright|tJ}. The ﬁnal conditional\ntrace,/angbracketleftˆC†ˆC/angbracketright|clickis given by a weighted average over this\nsequence with weights determined by the inﬁnitesimal\njump probability, δpJ∝Γom(tJ)dtin an interval dtat\ntimetJ. The eﬀects of detector dark counts as well as\nthe optical pump ﬁlter in our experiment are incorpo-\nrated via appropriate modiﬁcations to these weights.\nWe perform a numerical simulation of our system by\nimplementing the above model using the QuTiP software\npackage [14]. Solutions to the master equation as well as\nthe required correlators are evaluated in a 10 ×10 Fock\nspace of the acoustic and microwave modes. To incor-\nporate eﬀec\ntors are evaluated in a 10 ×10 Fock\nspace of the acoustic and microwave modes. To incor-\nporate eﬀects of heating of the microwave and acous-\ntic baths separately in our model, we measured the un-\nconditional microwave emission from the transducer in\nresponse to optical pump pulses under two conditions\n(i) mechanics far detuned from the microwave mode,\nωc−ωb/greatermuch2gpe, (ii) mechanics on resonance with the mi-\ncrowave mode, ωb=ωc. The results of the measurement\nare shown with the dotted traces in Fig. S7d. Under\ncondition (i), which is achieved at zero magnetic ﬁeld,\nthe microwave emission is approximately entirely due to\nheating of the microwave bath alone. On the other hand,\ncondition (ii) corresponds to maximal electro-mechanical\nhybridization and is relevant to the SPDC experiments\ndescribed in the main text. In this setting, heating of\nboth microwave and acoustic baths is expected to con-\ntribute to the measured microwave output signal. Us-\ning measurements of the microwave emission under both\nconditions, we invert the master equation to determine\nnth,b(t) andnth,c(t) approximated as a piece-wise linear\nfunction over coarse samples as shown in Fig. S7b. The\ninversion is performed by choosing an ansatz for nth,b(t)\nandnth,c(t), iteratively solving the master equation and\nperforming least mean square optimization with respect\nto the experimentally measured thermal microwave emis-\nBath occupation\nsimulation\nmeasur ed\nsimulation: far detuned\nsimulation: on r esonancemeasur ement: far detuned\nmeasur ement: on r esonance\n0 2\nt (µs)1 -1 -0.5 0.5 1.5 2.5nth,b\nnth,c\n00.10.20.10.15\n0.0500.5100.4\n0.20.6naa\nb\nc\nd\nFIG.

The resulting occupations of the acoustic mode, ˆb\nand of the unconditional temporal microwave mode, ˆC\nobtained by solving the master equation are shown in\nFig. S7c and with the solid traces in Fig. S7d respec-\ntively. While the model for the hot baths is determined\nentirely using microwave measurements, we observe that\nthe simulated occupation of the acoustic mode is in rea-\nsonable agreement with an experimental measurement\nshown by the gray data point in Fig. S7c. This data\npoint corresponds to the optomechanical si\nement\nshown by the gray data point in Fig. S7c. This data\npoint corresponds to the optomechanical sideband asym-\nmetry measurement described in Section 6, and repre-\nsents the thermal occupation of the acoustic mode aver-\naged over the duration of the optical pump pulse. Finally,\nthe conditional microwave emission determined using our\nmodel shown with the solid purple trace in Fig. S8 is in\ngood agreement with the corresponding experimental re-\nsult shown via the dotted purple trace. The simulated\nconditional and unconditional intensity traces plotted in\nthis ﬁgure predict a value of g(2)\nAC(τo) = 3.97, which is in\ngood agreement with the experimentally observed value\nof 3.90.\nSimulation of g(2)\nCC|click requires evaluation of\n/angbracketleftˆC†2ˆC2/angbracketright|click. Extending the approach of Eq. (24)\nto the second order moment is a nontrivial computa-\ntional endeavor as it requires calculation of the four-time\ncorrelator,/angbracketleftˆc†(t+t/prime/prime/prime/prime)ˆc†(t+t/prime/prime/prime)ˆc(t+t/prime/prime)ˆc(t+t/prime)/angbracketright.\nFor the purpose of this work, we pursue the more\ntractable task of placing bounds on g(2)\nCC|click. First,\nwe consider the conditional state of the acoustic mode\nimmediately after the addition of a phonon as triggered\nby an SPDC event. Since the extraction of this acoustic\nstate into the microwave output port is accompanied\nby loss and addition of noise, we expect the func-\ntion,g(2)\nbb|click =/angbracketleftˆb†2b2/angbracketright|click/(/angbracketleftˆb†b/angbracketright|click)2to provide\na lower bound for g(2)\nCC|click. Our model estimates\ng(2)\nbb|click(0) = 0.24. Next, we consider a choice of the\nemission envelope function, f(t) =δ(t−To−τo), where\nTois the time corresponding to the peak intensity of the\npump pulse. Physically, employing this function results\nin collecting the microwave emission at all frequencies\nfrom the transducer at a ﬁxed time. This is strictly less\noptimal than the choice in our measurements, name\ne transducer at a ﬁxed time. This is strictly less\noptimal than the choice in our measurements, namely\na function coherently matched to the theoretically ex-\npected single photon wavepacket as discussed in Sec. 8.\nIn the event of this sub-optimal choice, moments of the\ntemporal mode, ˆCare proportional to the corresponding\nmoments of the internal microwave mode, ˆ cand the\nfunction,g(2)\ncc|click=/angbracketleftˆc†2c2/angbracketright|click/(/angbracketleftˆc†c/angbracketright|click)2, serves as\nan upper bound for g(2)\nCC|click. Our model estimates\ng(2)\ncc|click(τo) = 0.77. In summary, the above argu-\nments allow us to use numerical simulations to bound\ng(2)\nCC|click(τo) to the interval (0.24, 0.77), which has\nsubstantial overlap with the experimental observation of\ng(2)\nCC|click(τo) = 0.42+0.27\n−0.28.13. DATA ANALYSIS FOR CORRELATION\nFUNCTIONS\nFor measurements of g(2)\nACandg(2)\nCC|clickpresented in ﬁg-\nure 3 of the main text, 9 .1×104heterodyne voltage traces\nwere acquired over a one month period. For every ∼16\nminutes of acquisition of conditional microwave data, we\ninterleaved the acquisition of voltage samples of ampli-\nﬁer noise and the unconditional microwave signal. The\nunconditional microwave intensity signal, ¯C11(τ) used to\nevaluate the normalized cross-correlation function, g(2)\nAC\nwas obtained from 1 .4×107heterodyne voltage traces.\nLikewise, the measurement of the normalized second or-\nder intensity correlation function, g(2)\nCC(τo) used 3.2×107\nheterodyne voltage samples.\na b\n10.20.40.60.81\nnm 02 344310\n2\n10.20.40.60.81\nnm 02 344310\n2\nFIG. S9. a.Moments matrix for the unconditional microwave\noutput of the transducer, ¯Cmn.b.Moments matrix for the\nmicrowave output of the transducer conditioned on receipt of\nan optical click, ¯Cmn|click. Error bars calculated via boot-\nstrapping with replacement are indicated by the black pins.\nTo minimize the eﬀect of long term ﬂuctuations in\nthe added noise and gain of the TWPA, we divide the\ndataset into chunks correspo\nterm ﬂuctuations in\nthe added noise and gain of the TWPA, we divide the\ndataset into chunks corresponding to acquisition over\none day, and invert each separately to extract the mo-\nments ¯C(k)\nmn,¯C(k)\nmn|click, where the index kruns over the\ndaily chunks. This inversion process follows the meth-\nods detailed in Sec. 7 and assumes that no correlations\nexist between ˆHand ˆAas well as ˆHand ˆC. We then\ntake a weighted average to compute the entries of the\nmoments matrix, ¯Cmn=/summationtext\nkw(k)¯C(k)\nmnand ¯Cmn|click=/summationtext\nkw(k)\nclick¯C(k)\nmn|click, wherew(k),w(k)\nclickdenote the frac-\ntion of records in the kthchunk of the unconditional and\nconditional datasets respectively. The moments matrices\nconstructed from this process are shown in Fig. S9b.\nThe acquisition rate for the moments of the condi-\ntional heterodyne output, ¯Smn|clickis determined by the\noptical heralding rate, Rclick= 0.14 Hz. This is much\nslower compared to that for the ampliﬁer noise moments,\n¯Hmn, which can be acquired at the 50 kHz repetition\nrate of the experiment and determined with high accu-\nracy. As a result, the error in g(2)\nCC|clickis dominated by\nuncertainty in ¯Smn|click. To calculate error in g(2)\nCCand\ng(2)\nCC|click, we employ bootstrapping with replacement us-S13\ning 105bootstraps to construct the probability density\nfunctions shown in Fig. S10a. Finally, error estimates\nwere calculated by numerical integration of the distribu-\ntions such that they they cover a 34.1% conﬁdence in-\nterval above and below the mean. The error estimates\ncalculated using this process vs. number of bootstraps\nis shown in Fig. S10b-c for the conditional and uncondi-\ntional datasets. We ﬁnd that the use of 105bootstraps\nyields acceptable convergence in the error estimate.\nTo mitigate the eﬀects of long term drifts in frequencies\nof the microwave modes, we periodically measured the\nunconditional microwave power spectrum and monitored\nthe resonance frequencies, ω±. This additionally allowed\nus to ch\nowave power spectrum and monitored\nthe resonance frequencies, ω±. This additionally allowed\nus to characterize the spectral diﬀusion of the microwave\nmodes. In our data analysis, we excluded intervals of\nthe measurement where the mode frequencies drifted by\nmore than twice the standard deviation associated with\nspectral diﬀusion, which represented 3% of all recorded\ntraces.\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nBootstraps0.270.280.29Err{ gCC|click }\n0.130.1350.140.145\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nBootstraps x104a\nb-0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5/gid00017/gid00018/gid00019/gid00020\ncProb.

CLASSICAL BOUND ON THE\nCONDITIONAL SECOND ORDER INTENSITY\nCORRELATION\nIn the main text, we claim that the conditional mi-\ncrowave autocorrelation function is expected to satisfy\nthe inequality, g(2)\nCC|click≥1 for classical microwave-\noptical states. This can be proved by rewriting the con-\nditional quantities deﬁned in the main text in terms ofcorrelators of the joint microwave-optical state,\ng(2)\nCC(τ)|click=/angbracketleftˆC†2(τ)ˆC2(τ)/angbracketright|click/parenleftBig\n/angbracketleftˆC†(τ)ˆC(τ)/angbracketright|click/parenrightBig2\n=/angbracketleftˆA†ˆC†2(τ)ˆC2(τ)ˆA/angbracketright/angbracketleftˆA†ˆA/angbracketright\n/parenleftBig\n/angbracketleftˆA†ˆA/angbracketright/angbracketleftˆC†(τ)ˆC(τ)/angbracketright/parenrightBig2, (25)\nwhere the above correlators are explicitly written in nor-\nmal order. Using the the optical equivalence theorem,\nwe can recast the expectation values of the above cor-\nrelators in phas\noptical equivalence theorem,\nwe can recast the expectation values of the above cor-\nrelators in phase space using the Sudarshan-Glauber P\nrepresentation [18, 19] as\n/angbracketleftˆA†mˆC†n(τ)ˆAmˆCn(τ)/angbracketright=/integraldisplay\n|α|2m|γ|2nPτ(α,γ)d2αd2γ\n:=/angbracketleft|α|2m|γ|2n/angbracketrightPτ, (26)\nwherePτ(α,γ) is the joint phase space density cprre-\nsponding to modes ˆAand ˆCwith relative delay τ. Ap-\nplying this directly to Eq. (25) gives,\ng(2)\nCC(τ)|click=/angbracketleft|α|2\nP|γ|4/angbracketrightPτ/angbracketleft|α|2/angbracketrightPτ\n/angbracketleft|α|2|γ|2/angbracketright2\nPτ≥1, (27)\nwhich follows directly from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequal-\nity.\n15. CONVERGENCE OF g(2)\nACTO THE\nCLASSICAL BOUND\nThe results of pump power dependent measurements of\nthe normalized intensity cross-correlation function, g(2)\nAC\nare shown in Fig. S11.\n1gAC(τ0)(2)\n10\nna135\nFIG.

We observe that at higher pump powers,\nthe value of g(2)\nACapproaches the classical upper bound\nof 2 as expected from the increased thermal noise added\nto the photon pair generated in SPDC. The data in thisﬁgure was collected from the same device used for the\nexperiments in the main text albeit after a partial warm\nup and cooldown to base temperature.

As examples of application, we computationally \ndemonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced \nmagnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative \nphase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes.

The strong coupling between the Kittel mode magnon \n(spatially uniform precession of magnetization) and the cavity photon was theoret ically predicted \nby Soykal and Flatté9,10 and experimentally observed in hybrid systems that involve a yttrium iron \ngarnet (YIG) bulk crystal slab11,12, permalloy thin-film stripe13, YIG film14 mounted on a coplanar \nmicrowave resonator, or YIG bulk crystal sphere(s) /slab  inside a three-dimensional (3D) \nmicrowave cavity4,15–19. One key feature of such strong coupling is the mode frequency splitting \nwith an avoided crossing in the frequency spectrum, which indicates the hybridizati on of magnon \nand photon into a new quasiparticle called magnon polariton14,18,20. In the time-domain, the energy \nof magnon polaritons is constantly exchanged between the magnon and the photon system with \n100% conversion efficiency.  \nTo realize practical quantum operation such as mode swapping and storage21, it is necessary \nto dynamical ly control the exchange process bet\nch as mode swapping and storage21, it is necessary \nto dynamical ly control the exchange process between the two hybrid modes of magnon polaritons \nupon the completion of transferring a single quantum of excitation2. For example, Floquet \nengineering22 — which herein refers to the simultaneous application of a periodic driving magne tic \nfield —  has been successfully implemented to in situ  control the transition between the two hybrid \nmodes and even induce further splitting of each mode into two energy levels associ ated with \ndifferent Floquet modes23, analogous to the Autler-Townes splitting in atomic physics. The \nprinciples of magnon polariton formation and the magnonic Autler-Townes splitting ca n be well \nexplained by Hamiltonian-based theoretical analysis23,24, but such theoretical calculations need to \ntake magnon-photon coupling strength as the input and are therefore not predictive16,23. To predict \nthe time-domain dynamics of the coupled physical processes and thus guide the des ign of cavity \nstructure and control conditions for realizing desirable quantum operation, it would be more \nconvenient to develop a computational model that works based on direct numerical sol ution of \ngoverning equations with fundamental material parameters as the input. \nThe dynamically evolving physical parameters in a cavity electromagnonic system include the \nmagnetic-field component ( HEM) of the electromagnetic (EM) wave in the microwave cavity, the \nmagnetization ( M) and elastic strain ( e) the magnon resonator (e.g., YIG). The propagation of HEM \nis governed by the Maxwell’s equations, while dynamical evolution of M and e, which represent \nthe magnon and phonon subsystem, are usually described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (L LG) \nequation and elastodynamic equation, respectively. Crucially, the dynamics of M is modulated by \nthe HEM via the Zeeman torque, while in the meantime M and e are coupled via magnetoelastic \ninteraction. Therefore, a complete, direct numer\nhe meantime M and e are coupled via magnetoelastic \ninteraction. Therefore, a complete, direct numerical simulation of the dynamical processes in a \ncavity electromagnonic system requires the simultaneous solution of the coupled LLG, \nelastodynamic, and Maxwell’s equations. The formulation of such a computational model is \nmathematically complex because the discontinuity in material paramet ers requires the placement \nof complex magnetic, mechanical, and electromagnetic boundary conditions at the interfaces. \nFurthermore, the large mismatch in the spatial and temporal scale s of the different physical \nprocesses require the simultaneous use of small cell size  and small time step  to resolve the smallest \nfeature length and fastest dynamical process. As a result, the computational  cost can be \nexceedingly high when the system size is large.   3 Due to these challenges, there only exist a few advanced computational model s that include \ncoupled dynamics of M and EM wave25–28 but excludes either the exchange coupling field (i.e., \nmacrospin model) in the LLG equation25,27,28 or the displacement current in the Maxwell’s \nequations26. Recently, models that include coupled dynamics of e, M, and EM wave have also \nappeared29–32, but these models are either limited to 1D system30–32 or based on simplified \nelastodynamic equation29. In this article, we present a dynamical phase-field model that includes  \nthe coupled dynamics of e, M, and EM wave in a 3D cavity electromagnonic system by solving \nthe exact for ms of the coupled LLG, elastodynamic, and Maxwell’s equations (see Methods). Thi s \nnew computational model enables a more accurate simulation of the magnon m odes dynamics than \nexisting models. Furthermore, our new model can be used to design and discover new physi cal \nphenomena that involves strong coupling or entanglement among phonons, magnons, and \nphotons33–36, which has previously not been possible. All numerical solvers are accelera ted by \ngraphics processi\nwhich has previously not been possible. All numerical solvers are accelera ted by \ngraphics processing unit (GPU) to increase the computation throughput. We demonstrate the \ncapability of the model in simulating the time-domain dynamics of excitation and dyna mical \ncontrol of magnon polariton modes in cavity electromagnonic systems. Typical coherent  gate \noperations including Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference are computational ly demonstrated. \n \nResults \nSimulation system set-up \nFigure 1a schematically shows the cavity electromagonic system. YIG, w hich has been widely \nused in hybrid magnonic systems15–17,33,37 –41 due to its ultralow magnetic damping, is used as the \nmagnon resonator. The 3D microwave cavity has a dimension of 45×9×21 mm3, which supports \nthe TE101 mode of the standing EM waves with a frequency wc/2p=7.875 GHz. To excite the \nTE101 cavity mode, a point charge current pulse Jc(t) in the form of a Gaussian function exp(-\n!!\n\"#\"!)×t is applied along the y axis (i.e ., only the 𝐽$% component is nonzero) at the position (22.5mm, \n1.5mm, 10.5mm) of the cavity, where σ0 is a free parameter that controls the pulse duration and \nchosen to be 70 ps so that the frequency window of the pulse covers the wc. The simulated HEM \nhas a vortex-like distribution in the xz plane, as shown in Fig. 1a. The YIG resonator is placed at \n1.5 mm below the top surface center of the cavity, where the magnitude of HEM is relatively large. \nAt the initial equilibrium state, the magnetization in the YIG m0 is along + z ([001]) due to a bias \nmagnetic field Hbias=(0,0, Hzbias) applied along the same direction. Note that energy dissipation of \nboth the cavity photon (arising from the imaginary component of the relative dielectri c permittivity \ntensor εr) and magnon (arising from the effective magnetic damping) are both set to be zero t o \nstudy the magnon-photon coupling under the most ideal situation. \nThe entire system is discretized into three-dimensional (3D) compu\n under the most ideal situation. \nThe entire system is discretized into three-dimensional (3D) computational cells with a cell \nsize ∆ x=∆y=∆z=2 nm. Numerically, a nm- scale computational cell is necessary to ensure spatial \nuniformity of the magnetization (i.e., the formation of Kittel mode magnon) via the Hexch \n(proportional to | ∇m|2) between neighboring spins. Moreover, a basis for any micromagnetic \nsimulation is that the cell size needs to be smaller than the exc hange length lex=#Aex(0.5µ0Ms2)⁄ , \nwhich is about 16.3 nm for YIG with an exchange coupling coefficient 𝐴+, of 3.26 pJ/m and Ms= \n140 kA/m42. However, discretization of a 45×9×21 mm3 system using a cell size of ∆ x=∆y=∆z=2 \nnm would lead to a total of about 1021 cells, which is computationally unaffordable. To address \nthe issue, the εr is tuned to scale down the EM wavelength and hence the size of the mic rowave \ncavity. For example, in the case of 1×1×1 mm3 YIG cube, we set all three diagonal components of  4 the εr to be 6.25×1010 for both the YIG cube and the microwave cavity, thus the EM wavelength \nis scaled down by 2.5×105 (=√εr) times. Accordingly, the size of the microwave cavity can be \nreduced from 45×9×21 mm3 to 180×36×84 nm3 (i.e., 68,040 cells) without changing the spatial \nprofile and the frequency of the TE101 mode EM wave. Meanwhile, the size of the 1×1×1 mm3 \nYIG cube should be scaled down to 4×4×4 nm3 to maintain a constant volume ratio of the YIG \ncube to microwave cavity. Although such size down-scaling makes it not possibl e to simulate the \nhigh-order magnon modes (spatially non-uniform precession of local magnetization) that ma y \noccur in a mm-scale YIG, it would not influence the present work on the interact ion between Kittel \nmode magnon and cavity photon. Importantly, although the larger εr leads to a smaller EEM, the \nmagnitude of HEM, which interacts with the magnetization, remains constant (see Eqs. (4-5) i n \nMethods). As a result, the simulated coupled magnon-photon\non, remains constant (see Eqs. (4-5) i n \nMethods). As a result, the simulated coupled magnon-photon dynamics remains the same  as that \nin the original mm-scale system. Furthermore, the use of a larger εr allows using a larger time step  \nwhich significantly reduces the computation time in long-term dynamics simulat ion (see Methods).  \nMagnon-photon coupling \nTo demonstrate the validity and high numerical accuracy of our computational mode l, we first \nsimulate the formation of the commonly observed k=0 mode magnon polariton ( k is wavenumber), \nwhich features the hybridization between the k=0 (Kittel) mode magnon m/ and k»0 mode cavity \nphoton c0. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the HEM, which is perpendicular to the initial equilibrium \nmagnetization m0 (see Fig. 1a), drives the magnetization precession. Due to the exchange coupl ing, \nall local magnetization vectors m in the YIG precess in phase, resulting in the excitation of the \ndesirable Kittel mode magnon. Since HEM is largely uniform around the YIG cube ( i.e., \nwavenumber k»0) and the magnon-photon interaction time is sufficiently long in the present 3D \ncavity, the k=0 mode magnon polariton should form if the angular frequency of the Kittel mode \nmagnon wm, or the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency, can be magnetically tuned to matc h \nthe angular frequency of the cavity wc. Specifically, for an initial equilibrium magnetization along \n[001], one has wm/2p=γ(Hzbias-1\n3Ms+2K1\nμ0Ms)30, where  γ=27.86 GHz/T is the gyromagnetic ratio and \nK1=620 J /m3 is the magnetocrystalline anisotropy coefficient of the YIG. Accordingly, Hbias=(0, 0, \n0.291 T) is applied to have wm/2p=wc/2p=7.875 GHz. \nFigure 1b shows the dynamics of the Kittel magnon mode and the photon, where Dt=0 refer \nto the moment at 20 ns after the injection of the Gaussian-shaped current puls e Jc(t) at t=0 ns. \nTypical behavior of coherent beating oscillation similar to a two-level system31,43 is observed. \nSpecifically, the peak amplitudes of t\n oscillation similar to a two-level system31,43 is observed. \nSpecifically, the peak amplitudes of the two modes show a Rabi-like oscil lation16 with a period of \n~6.9 ns (frequency ~ 145 MHz), suggesting a back-and-forth energy transfer between the YIG and \nthe microwave cavity. For clearer illustration, Figure 1c shows the simulat ed magnon state and \nspatial distribution of the radiation electric field EEM(t) at a few representative moments. As shown \nin the left panel, when the EEM reaches its peak amplitude, the magnetization m aligns almost \nalong its initial direction [001], indicating an almost zero free energy change in the YIG. As the \nenergy is being transferred from the cavity to the YIG, the amplitude of EEM in the cavity decreases \nwhile the amplitude of the magnon mode (or |Δ m|=2(∆𝑚-)\"+5∆𝑚$6\" increases, as shown in \nthe middle panel. After a half period of the energy transfer (3.45 ns = 6.9 ns/2), almost all the EM \nwave energy is absorbed by the YIG, which is indicated by the negligibly small EEM in the cavity \nand relatively large |Δ m|, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1c. Figure 1d shows the frequency \nspectrum of the temporal waveform Δ mx(t) in Fig. 1b, which reveals two peak frequencies at 7.8  5 GHz and 7.945 GHz, respectively. The two peak frequencies are symmetric with respect to the \nwm/2p=wc/2p=7.875 GHz with a frequency gap of 145 MHz, indicating the formation of magnon \npolariton with two different hybrid modes d7+ and d7-. The frequency gap (denoted as 𝛿.) is \nconsistent with the frequency of the Rabi-like oscillation and defines a magnon-phot on coupling \nstrength gcm=δD/2=2p´72.5 MHz. It is worth remarking that the magnon subsystem of the YIG is \nalso coupled to the phonon subsystem, because the precessing m generates dynamical strain via \nthe magnetoelastic feedback (Eq. 2) and the dynamical strain in turn modulate s the dynamics of m \nvia the Hmel (Eq. 1). Moreover, the stiffness damping coefficient β in the elastodynamic equati\nf m \nvia the Hmel (Eq. 1). Moreover, the stiffness damping coefficient β in the elastodynamic equation \ncreates an additional channel for energy dissipation. However, in the present syst em, the energy \nexchange between magnon and phonon subsystems is negligible because the magnitude o f the \ndynamical strain is negligibly small (~10-7) due to the relatively small magnetoelastic coupling \nconstant of the YIG. \nFigure 1e shows the numerically simulated mode frequencies (indicated by holl ow circles) \nas functions of the bias magnetic field in three different hybrid systems where the sizes of the YIG \ncube are 0.4×0.4×0.4 mm3, 1×1×1 mm3 and 2×2×2 mm3, respectively, and the cavity size remains \nto be 45×9×21 mm3. The goal of these simulations is to computationally verify the theoretical  \nrelation of gcm =𝑔/√N (Ref. 15), where 𝑔/ is the coupling strength of a single Bohr magneton to \nthe cavity; N is the total spin number in the YIG and increases linearly with its size . The presence \nof avoided crossings in all three systems indicate the formation of magnon polarit ons. The \ncorresponding magnon-photon coupling strength gcm can be extracted from the frequency gap \nunder on-resonance m/ and c0 modes (where Δ Hbias=0), which are 2 p´18.3 MHz, 2 p´72.5 MHz, \nand 2p´182.2 MHz, respectively. One can evaluate that the gcm is largely proportional to the square \nroot of the cube size and hence the √N. The gcm in the case of 2×2×2 mm3 is smaller than the value \nof 2p´204.6 MHz obtained from linear extrapolation due to the \u003C100% spatial mode profile \noverlapping, which is consistent with experimental observation16. Based on the extracted gcm, we \nfit the simulations results via the expression 𝜔±=1\n2(𝜔m+𝜔c)±1\n22(𝜔m-𝜔c)2+4gcm2, which describe \nthe angular frequencies of the two hybrid modes ( d7+ and d7-) in a two-level system44. The excellen t \nfitting indicat es the validity of our model set-up and high numerical accuracy of our dynamical \nphase-field model.  \nFloquet-induced m\nur model set-up and high numerical accuracy of our dynamical \nphase-field model.  \nFloquet-induced magnonic Autler-Townes splitting \nBased on the cavity electromagnonic system with a YIG resonator of 1×1×1 mm3, a \nperiodic dynamical magnetic field hD(t) is applied along the same axis ( z) with the Hbias to \nimplement Floquet engineering. The hD(t)=|hD|sin(wDt) is applied uniformly on the YIG resonator, \nwhere | hD| and wD are the amplitude and angular frequency of the Floquet drive, respectively. \nFigure 2a shows the frequency spectra of the Δ mx(t) simulated under a fixed | hD| of 2000 A/m but \ndifferent wD/2π varying from 0 to 400 MHz. A static bias magnetic field of 0.2315 MA/m  (~0.291 \nT) is applied to have the magnon mode on resonance with the cavity photon and generate t wo \nmagnon polariton modes 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=-, which have frequenc ies of 7.945 GHz and 7.8 GHz, \nrespectively. Each polariton mode has several sidebands created by the Floquet  drive. The \nfrequencies of these sidebands either increase or decrease as the wD increases. When wD is equal \nto the (cavity and magnon) mode splitting frequency (=2 gcm=2p´145 MHz), the first inner \nsideband of the magnon polariton mode 𝑑=+ (𝑑=-) resonantly interact with the other magnon \npolariton mode 𝑑=- (𝑑=+). As a result, the two energy levels corresponding to the 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes  6 split into four energy levels associated with different Floquet modes (as ill ustrated in the inset), \nwhere the frequency gap between the two newly split energy levels is denoted a s ΔwAT, with \nΔwAT/2p=34.8 MHz.  Such magnonic Autler-Townes splitting23 and the onset of avoided crossing \nindicate the realization of strong coupling between the two hybrid modes of the ma gnon polaritons \nby Floquet drive. \nTo gain further insights on the simulated spectrum, we analytically calcula te the absorption \nspectrum of the magnon mode based on Floquet theory described in Ref. 23, using the numerically \nsimulated on-resonance frequency w0 (=wm=wc) \net theory described in Ref. 23, using the numerically \nsimulated on-resonance frequency w0 (=wm=wc) and the magnon-photon coupling strength gcm as \nthe inputs. As shown in Fig. 2b, the main structure of the calculated spectru m (shown in Fig. 2b) \nreproduces the simulation results. The calculated spectrum can be understood by w riting the \nFloquet Hamiltonian as following (details of derivation are in Ref. 23), \n𝐻?\nℏ=𝜔0𝑑=00𝑑=0+𝜔1𝑑=10𝑑=1+𝑔%2A𝐽3(Ω\n𝜔.)\n34566C𝑑=00𝑑=1𝑒𝐢(39#!)+𝑑=0𝑑=10𝑒1𝐢(39#!)E.(1) \nHere 𝜔±=𝜔/±𝑔%2, Ω=𝛾|𝐡.|, and ℏ is the reduced Planck’s constant. A list of symbols for \nvarious modes and related quantities is provided in Supplemental Material 1. The Floquet drive \ncreates a series of sidebands of the 𝑑=± modes at frequencies 𝜔±±𝑛𝜔., where n is the sideband \norder. The last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) describes the interactions  between different \nsidebands, where 𝐽3 is the 𝑛th Bessel function of the first kind. From Eq. (1), one can determine \nthat the coupling strength between the first inner sideband of 𝑑=1 and the 𝑑=0 mode (i.e., the \nmagnonic Autler-Townes splitting Δ wAT) is approximated as Δw\u003C==2𝑔%2𝐽\u003EN?\n9#O. Plugging in \nthe numbers yields a theoretically predicted value of Δw\u003C=/2π ~ 34.1 MHz, which is in good \nagreement with the simulated value. At larger |𝐡.|, ΔwAT becomes oscillatory following the \nfeature of Bessel function, as discussed in Supplemental Material 2 and 6. Moreover, since the \nsum in Eq. (5) only involves odd terms, some of the sidebands ( e.g., the first inner sideband of 𝑑=0 \nand 𝑑=1 modes) are not directly coupled, which is revealed by the crossing in both the si mulated \nand calculated spectrum. Detailed discussion on this point can be found in Ref. 23.   \nOur dynamical phase-field simulation results in Fig. 2c further shows the temporal profile \nof the Δ mx(t) and 𝐸$@A(t) for wD/2π = 300 MHz. According to the frequency spectra in Fig. 2a, the \nmagnon polariton is still dominated by the intrinsic hybrid modes 𝑑=+ and\ny spectra in Fig. 2a, the \nmagnon polariton is still dominated by the intrinsic hybrid modes 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- with no magnonic \nAutler-Townes splitting. Correspondingly, the amplitudes of both the ∆ mx(t) and 𝐸$@A(t) display a \nRabi-like oscillation with a period of 6.9 ns, which is the same as in Fi g. 1b. By comparison, for \nwD/2π=145 MHz where the magnonic Autler-Townes splitting is prominent, the corres ponding \ntemporal profiles of ∆ mx(t) and 𝐸$@A(t), as shown in Fig 2d, are clearly composed of components \nof more than two frequencies. Despite the more complex temporal profile, the evol ution of ∆ mx(t) \nand 𝐸$@A(t) are still complementary (e.g., peak to valley), indicating that the back-and-fort h energy \nexchange still occurs between the Kittel magnon mode m/ and the cavity photon mode c0. The beam-\nsplitter type coupling between the 𝑑=+ (𝑑=-) and the first inner sideband of the 𝑑=- (𝑑=+) mode (Fig. 2a) \ncan also be interpreted as the energy exchange (i.e., Rabi-like oscillation) between the two energy \nlevels (i.e., the hybridized modes 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=-) through the frequency matching provided by the \nFloquet drive, i.e., 𝜔0=𝜔1+𝜔.. Similar Floquet-driven Rabi-like oscillation between two \nhybridized modes has also been demonstrated experimentally in a two-level photonic system21.  7 Dynamical control of the energy exchange rate between two magnon polariton modes \nThe Rabi-like oscillation between the two magnon polariton modes ( 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=-) \ncorresponds to a rotation along the real axis of a Bloch sphere, as illustrated i n Fig. 3a inset. Here, \nwe model this process in the time domain and computationally demonstrate the dynamical control \nof the energy exchange rate between the 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes (namely, Rabi flopping frequency) by \ndynamically varying the amplitude | hD| of the Floque drive. To this end, the system is initialized \nby pumping a 15-cycle sinusoidal charge current pulse Jc(t)=J 0sin(wt) at w=2π×7.945 GHz along \nthe y axis (i.e., only the 𝐽$% componen\narge current pulse Jc(t)=J 0sin(wt) at w=2π×7.945 GHz along \nthe y axis (i.e., only the 𝐽$% component is nonzero) to populate (excite) the 𝑑=+ mode. A continuous \nFloquet drive hD(t) at the cavity-magnon mode splitting frequency ( wD/2π=δD/2π=145 MHz) is \nthen applied to the system. Figure 3a shows the temporal evolution of the magnetization ampli tude \nof the 𝑑=+ mode magnon polariton (denoted as |∆𝐦|BC+) with | hD|=5000 A/m. Here \t|∆𝐦|BC+(t) is \nobtained by first extracting the temporal evolution of ∆𝑚-(t) and ∆𝑚$(t) by performing inverse \nFourier transform for 7.945- GHz (±50 MHz) peak in their frequency spectra and then calculating \nits magnetization amplitude via 2(∆𝑚-)\"+5∆𝑚$6\". The |∆𝐦|BC+(t) display a Rabi-like \noscillation with a period of 11.6 ns, corresponding to a flopping frequency of 86.2 MHz. We note \nthat the 𝑑=- mode magnon polariton (at 7.8 GHz) was also excited after the initial current  pulse \ninjection, and the dynamics of |∆𝐦|BC-(t) complements the |∆𝐦|BC+(t), as shown in Supplemental \nMaterial 3, suggesting a dynamical energy exchange between the 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes.  \nFigure 3b further summarizes the |∆𝐦|BC+(t) simulated under different | hD| varying from \n1000 to 5000 A/m. As shown, the period of Rabi-like oscillation decreases as | hD| increases. The \ncorresponding Rabi flopping frequency ( fRabi) agrees well with the Δ wAT/2π simulated under \ndifferent at | hD| at wD/2π=145 MHz (Supplemental Material 2). By analytically solving the \nHeisenberg equation of the 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes under the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we \nobtain the mode square S𝑑=+(𝑡)S\"=cos\"N?\nD𝑡O (see Supplemental Material 4), yielding \nfRabi=Ω/2=𝛾|𝐡E|/2. It is worth noting that Figure 3a shows a nonzero offset, which differs from the \nRWA-based prediction and may be due to the existence of other magnon modes. As show n in the \ninset of Fig. 3b, the analytically calculated fRabi agrees well with the simulated value with only \nsmall deviation at larger |𝐡E| values, where \n fRabi agrees well with the simulated value with only \nsmall deviation at larger |𝐡E| values, where the system’s behavior deviates from the RWA. As \n|𝐡E| further increases, it is no longer possible to numerically extract the |∆𝐦|BC+(t) from the \nsimulation results since multiple magnon modes coexist at 7.945 GHz. Thus, direct numerical \nevaluation of fRabi is not possible. However, it is reasonable to speculate that the fRabi»\tΔw\u003C=/2π \nsince the present Rabi oscillation is based on beam-splitter type coupling bet ween the 𝑑=+ (𝑑=-) and \nthe first inner sideband of the 𝑑=- (𝑑=+) mode, as discussed above. In this regard, fRabi should vary in \nan oscillatory manner with |𝐡E| following the Bessel function (see Supplemental Material 2), \nwhich differs significantly from the RWA-predicted linear relationship between fRabi and |𝐡E|.  \nDynamical control of the relative phase between two magnon polariton modes \nExperimentally, it has also been shown that driving the transition between tw o hybridized \nmodes of a two-level photonic system with detuned pulses enables a dynamical  control over the \nrelative phase of the two hybrid modes21. By analogy to the protocols described in Ref. 21, here we \ncomputationally demonstrate the dynamical control of the relative phase betwe en 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- mode \nmagnon polariton modes (namely, magnonic Ramsey interference). We first excite the  system to  8 the 𝑑=+ mode by injecting a 15-cycle sinusoidal Jc(t) at 7.945 GHz. A π/2 pulse of the Floquet drive \nfield hD(t) with a frequency of ωD=δD+∆ω is then applied to create excitations in a superposition \nof both the 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes, which is illustrated by S tate ‘I’ on the equator of the Bloch sphere \n(see Fig. 4a). Here, the duration \tof the π/2 pulse is 1/4th of the Rabi-like oscillation period under \nthe field amplitude | hD|=5000 A/m, i.e., t0=1/(4 fRabi)=2.9 ns. After the first π/2 pulse is turned off \n(hD(t) = 0), the excitation as superposition of 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes would start to prece\ns turned off \n(hD(t) = 0), the excitation as superposition of 𝑑=+ and 𝑑=- modes would start to precess along the \nequator of the Bloch sphere (i.e., free evolution) with a precession frequency determined by the \ndetuning amplitude ∆ ω. Upon the completion of the free evolution period, a second π/2 pulse is \napplied to project the excitations (State ‘II’ in the Bloch sphere) into the 𝑑=- mode. The amplitude \nof the 𝑑=- mode after the completion of second π/2 pulse is determined by the relative pha se between \nthe two modes. The relative phase difference is proportional to both the frequency detuning ∆ ω \nand the duration of free evolution t. To computationally demonstrate this principle, we record the \nmagnetization amplitude of the 𝑑=- mode (|∆𝐦|BC-) after the completion of the second π/2 pulse, as \na function of the free evolution duration τ under ∆ ω/2π =10,15 and 20 MHz. As shown in Fig. 4b, \nthe frequency for the variation of the |∆𝐦|BC- with the duration t is exactly equal to ∆ω. The result \nmatches the analytical expression, S𝑑=1(𝑡)S\"=|H|!\n\"sin\"N∆9\n\"𝜏O (see Supplemental Material 5), \nwhere 𝛼\tis the initial mode amplitude in 𝑑=+. \n \nDiscussion \nWe have developed a 3D dynamical phase-field model that incorporates the coupled \ndynamics of strain, magnetization, and EM wave in a cavity electromagnonic system, which \nintegrate magnon resonator(s) in a photon cavity. By solving the coupled equations of moti on for \nthese quantities under appropriate magnetic, mechanical, and EM boundary conditions, our \ncomputational model allows predicting the spatiotemporal evolution of strain, ma gnetization, and \nEM fields under various operating conditions directly from the fundamental material  parameters. \nAs examples, time-domain dynamics of relevant modes in typical coherent gate operations (Rabi \noscillation and Ramsey interference) are simulated. The physical validity a nd high numerical \naccuracy of our dynamical phase-field model were demonstrated by understanding the s\nhigh numerical \naccuracy of our dynamical phase-field model were demonstrated by understanding the sim ulation \nresults with analytical fitting and rigorous Hamiltonian-based Floquet theory. \nIn combination with the high throughput resulting from the GPU acceleration, the pres ent \n3D dynamical phase-field model can be used to guide the experimental design of the microwave \nphoton cavity, magnon resonator(s), and operating condition for the discovery of new physical \nphenomena as well as the optimization of key device features such as the coupling strength, mode \nswapping rate (e.g., Rabi flopping frequency), and cooperativity. Given the ability to predic t \ncoupled strain-magnetization-EM wave dynamics, our computational model can be directly \napplied to simulate and design systems where mutual interactions among phonons, magnons, and \nphotons are significant (a.k.a. cavity magnomechanics systems)33–36. \n \nMethods  \nA phase-field model leverages the symmetry-consistent use of continuum physical  order \nparameters and their gradients to describe the total free energy of a spatial ly inhomogeneous \nsystem. The functional derivative of the total free energy ( 𝐹K5K) with respect to a specific order \nparameter yields the thermodynamic driving force that drives the evolution of the order parameter.  9 For example, the effective magnetic field that drives the evolution of M is calculated as 𝐇+LL=\n−\u003E\nM\"NO%&%\nN𝐌, where 𝜇/ is vacuum permeability. In a dynamical phase-field model, equations of \nmotion for all key order parameters are typically solved in their exact forms30,31,45. This is different \nfrom conventional phase-field model, where faster-evolving order parameters are often a ssumed \nto reach steady or equilibrium state instantaneously46. A dynamical phase-field model is \nparticularly necessary for hybrid systems featuring bidirectional dynamical energy exc hange and \nconversion between different physical subsystems, as in cavity electromagnonic systems.  \nAs an exam\nconversion between different physical subsystems, as in cavity electromagnonic systems.  \nAs an example, we consider a commonly used system that contains a bulk ma gnon resonator \nin a 3D microwave cavity. The evolution of the normalized magnetization m= M/Ms in the magnon \nresonator, where Ms is the saturation magnetization, is governed by the LLG equation, i.e., \n∂m\n∂t=−γ\n1+𝛼+LL\"m×Heff−𝛼+LLγ\n1+𝛼+LL\"m×5m×Heff6,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (2) \nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio; 𝛼+LL is the effective magnetic damping coefficient; \nHeff=Happ+Hanis+Hexch+Hmel+Hd+HEM is the total effective magnetic field, where the externally \napplied magnetic field  Happ(t) includes both the static bias magnetic field Hbias and a dynamic \nFloquet driving magnetic field  hD(t); Hanis and Hexch are the effective magnetic field resulting from \nthe functional derivatives of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and exchange coupl ing \nenergy with respect to m, respectively, and their expressions are provided in our previous work30; \nHmel is the effective magnetoelastic field, Hd is the demagnetization field, and HEM is the magnetic \nfield of the cavity electromagnetic wave. Hmel is calculated as 𝐇2+Q=−\u003E\nM\"RS'()*\nR𝐌. Here the elastic \nfree energy density 𝑓+QTU=\u003E\n\"𝑐VWXY(𝜀XY−𝜀XY/)5𝜀VW−𝜀VW/6, with i, j = x, y, z. Here the 𝑐VWXY is the \nelastic stiffness tensor; for magnets of cubic symmetry, the stress-free st rain 𝜀VV/=Z\n\"𝜆\u003E//N𝑚V\"−\u003E\nZO \nand 𝜀VW/=Z\n\"𝜆\u003E\u003E\u003E𝑚V𝑚W, where 𝜆\u003E// and 𝜆\u003E\u003E\u003E are magnetostriction coefficients. The local total \nstrain 𝜀VW can be written as 𝜀VW(𝑡)=𝜀VW+[+∆𝜀VW(𝑡), where the 𝜀VW+[ is the total strain at the initial \nequilibrium state and can be obtained by solving the mechanical equilibrium equa tion \n∇∙𝜎VW+[=∇∙f𝑐VWXY5𝜀VW+[−𝜀VW/,+[6g=0. For a stress-free magnetic material, 𝜀VW+[=𝜀VW/,+[. The latter can \nbe calculated based on the magnetization direction 𝑚V at the initial equilibrium state. The \ndynamical strain ∆𝜀VW is calculated via ∆𝜀VW=\u003E\n\"NR∆]+\nRW+R∆],\nRVO, \n initial equilibrium state. The \ndynamical strain ∆𝜀VW is calculated via ∆𝜀VW=\u003E\n\"NR∆]+\nRW+R∆],\nRVO, and the time-varying local \nmechanical displacement ∆ u= u -ueq is obtained by solving the elastodynamic equation,  \nρ∂2∆u\n∂t2=∇∙(∆σ+β∂∆σ\n∂t),\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (3) \nwhere ∆σ=σ-σeq is the dynamical stress; ρ is the mass density, and β is the stiffness damping \ncoefficient. Since Eq. (3) is solved for the entire system, the material pa rameters 𝑐VWXY, ρ, and β \nvary in different phases, where the continuity boundary condition for u and σ47 are applied at the \ninterface between the magnon resonator and the microwave cavity. In this regard, by s etting the \n𝑐VWXY of the microwave cavity to be zero, the stress-free surface of the magnon resonator is \nautomatically considered. The magnon resonator is cube-shaped, which is a computa tionally more \ntractable geometry because the entire simulation system is discretized by cube-shaped ce lls.  10 The demagnetization (stray) field Hd can be expressed as 𝐻V6(𝑡)=𝐻V6,+[+∆𝐻V6(𝑡). The \n𝐻V6,+[ is produced by the magnetization m0=m(t=0) at the initial equilibrium state inside the \nmagnon resonator, and can be obtained by solving the continuity equation for magnetic flux ∇∙\n𝐁+[=∇∙f𝜇/5𝐇6,+[+𝐦𝟎𝑀_6g=0, which is part of the Maxwell’s equations. The magnetic \nboundary condition ¶m/¶n=0 is applied on the surfaces of the magnon resonator, where n is normal \nvector to the surface. For a cubic or spheric magnet with spatially uniform ma gnetization, Hd,eq =-\n1\n3 Ms(mx0, my0, mz0). The dynamically changing ∆𝐻V6(𝑡), which emerges when m starts to evolve, \ndoes not need to be calculated separately. Rather, the magnetic-field component of the EM wave \nHEM(t), which is obtained by solving the two dynamical equations in the Maxwell’s equations via \nthe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver on Yee grid (to be discussed below ), can \nautomatically satisfy the magnetic flux continuity equation ∇∙𝐁=0  across\nbe discussed below ), can \nautomatically satisfy the magnetic flux continuity equation ∇∙𝐁=0  across the heterointerfaces48. \nSpecifically, the spatiotemporal evolution of the HEM and the associated electric field component \nof the EM wave EEM are simulated by solving the Maxwell’s equations,  \n∇ × HEM = ε0εr∂EEM\n∂t+Jc , (4) \n∇ × EEM = -μ0l∂HEM\n∂t+1\n𝑀U∂m\n∂tm. (5) \nEquation (4-5) indicates that the HEM is produced by both the free charge current pulse Jc(t) via \nelectric dipole radiation and the precessing m(t) via magnetic dipole radiation. The perfect electric \nconductor (PEC) boundary condition is applied on all surfaces of the microwave cavity for \nreflecting the EM wave without loss. Specifically, Ei = 0 and Ej = 0 on the ij surfaces of the cavity \nfor PEC, with i = x, y, z, and j ≠ i. Other material parameters of YIG used in the simulations, \nincluding the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, magnetoelastic anisotropy, and elast ic stiffness \ncoefficients of YIG can be found in our previous work31. Central finite difference is used for \ncalculating spatial derivatives. Conventional Yee grid and the 3D FDTD met hod48 are used to \nnumerically discretize the EM wave and solve Eqs. (4-5). All dynamical equa tions are solved in a \ncoupled fashion using the classical Runge-Kutta method with a time step ∆t = 5×10-14 s. The choice \nof ∆t is subjected to the Courant condition for numerical convergence in conventional FDTD  \nalgorithm, which requires ∆t≤l0/(√3𝑣)27, where l0 is the  simulation cell size and 𝑣 is the EM wave \nvelocity in the media. Since the use of a larger εr leads to √εr times smaller 𝑣 compared to speed \nof light in vacuum, a larger ∆t can be used in this work, which significantly reduces the \ncomputational time in long-term dynamics simulation.  \n \nData Availability \nThe data that support the plots presented in this paper are available from the  corresponding authors \nupon reasonable request. \n \nCode Availability \nOpen-source codes for the present dynamical \nauthors \nupon reasonable request. \n \nCode Availability \nOpen-source codes for the present dynamical phase-field model can be accessed vi a \nhttps://github.com/jhu238/GO-Ferro.  \n  11 Acknowledgement \nJ.-M.H. acknowledges the support from the National Science Foundation under the grant numbe r \nCBET-2006028 and DMR-2237884.

Teleportation channels are\ncreated by distributing an entangled state between two nodes\nwhich is a probabilistic process requiring classical communica-\ntion. This causes critical delays that can cause information loss as\nquantum data suffers from decoherence when stored in memory.\nIn this work, we quantify the effect of decoherence on ﬁdelity\nat a node in a quantum network due to the storage of qubits in\nnoisy memory platforms. We model the memory platform as a\nbuffer that stores incoming qubits waiting for the creation of a\nteleportation channel. Memory platforms are parameterized with\ndecoherence rate and buffer size, in addition to the order in which\nthe incoming qubits are served. We show that ﬁdelity at a node\nis a linear sum of terms, exponentially decaying with time, where\nthe decay rate depends on the decoherence rate of the memory\nplatform. This allows us to utilize Laplace Transforms to derive\nefﬁciently computable functions of average ﬁdelity with respect\nto the load, buffer size, and decoherence rate of the memory\nplatform. We prove that serving qubits in a Last In First Out\norder with pushout for buffer overﬂow management is optimal\nin terms of average ﬁdelity. Lastly, we apply this framework to\nmodel a single repeater node to calculate the average ﬁdelity\nof the teleportation channels created by this repeater assuming\nperfect gate operations.\nIndex Terms —Quantum Networks Quantum Teleportation De-\ncoherence Fidelity Queuing Theory Quantum Memory Quantum\nRepeaters\nI. I NTRODU\ntum Teleportation De-\ncoherence Fidelity Queuing Theory Quantum Memory Quantum\nRepeaters\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networks face many problems inherently different\nfrom those in classical networks as qubits different from bits.\nOne of these problems arises from the (in)famous no-cloning\ntheorem. In addition Quantum networks implemented over\nﬁber suffer from exponential photonic loss with respect to\nﬁber length. Classical networks overcome similar loss by using\nsignal ampliﬁcation. Unfortunately, the no cloning theorem\nbars the use of signal ampliﬁcation, which means quantum\nnetworks need to ﬁnd another solution to the problem of\nloss. Quantum teleportation allows us to transfer quantum\ninformation between two spatially separated parties using\na distributed entangled state and classical communication\nwithout having to transfer the physical entity carrying that\nThis research was supported in part by the NSF grant CNS-1955834, NSF-\nERC Center for Quantum Networks grant EEC-1941583 and by the National\nScience Foundation to the Computing Research Association for the CIFellows\n2020 Program.information across the network making it invulnerable to loss.\nAnother important property of quantum teleportation is that\nit allows for secure communication and is a central part of\nquantum key distribution.\nQuantum teleportation is enabled through the use of en-\ntangled quantum states, the most common example of which\nis an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) states or Bell Pairs.\nTherefore, a key job for quantum networking devices like\nrepeaters, switches etc, is to distribute these EPR pairs between\ntwo nodes so that quantum information can be shared between\nthem, creating a teleportation channel. Many protocols exist\nfor the generation and distribution of EPR pairs but all of\nthem are probabilistic processes that can fail because of\nimperfections in physical operations like gate errors, signal\nloss in ﬁber etc. These probabilistic failures naturally give\nrise to many optimisation, control\nnal\nloss in ﬁber etc. These probabilistic failures naturally give\nrise to many optimisation, control and design problems in\nquantum networking devices, which is a ﬁeld of active study.\nThere have been many recent results regarding the modeling\nand analysis of entanglement distribution rates for nodes in\nquantum networks but a major assumption in most of these\nis the presence of noiseless memories. This is an issue as\nmost noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum\nmemory platforms cause ﬁdelity loss on any qubit stored in\nthem due to decoherence.\nWhen a qubit arrives at a node requesting teleportation, the\nnode must await the generation of an EPR pair between itself\nand the destination which causes delays. While the EPR pair\nis being generated, The request qubit has to be stored in a\nnoisy memory platform. This means that even if the EPR\npair is perfect, the request will suffer some decoherence. The\nsensitivity of a memory platform to noise is parameterized\nby decoherence time or rate and ﬁdelity decays exponentially\nwith time. Quantifying the effects of this decoherence on\nthe ﬁdelity of the teleportation allows us to come up with\nspeciﬁcations for memory platforms for different applications.\nAnother important question is memory management. Given\nthe fact that one can only store a ﬁnite amount of requests\nand EPR pairs, how should one schedule and serve requests to\nminimize decoherence and to deal with arrival of new requests\nwhen memory is full\nIn this paper, we quantify the ﬁdelity loss for a node of\na quantum network due to decoherence from memory and\nprovide a way to derive the ﬁdelity distribution or the averagearXiv:2205.06300v1  [quant-ph]  12 May 2022ﬁdelity. We use dephasing noise characterized by a dephasing\nrate\u0000capturing noise due to storage in a memory platform and\nderive an expression of ﬁdelity with respect to time spent in\nmemory by a request. We model the teleportation as a queuing\nprocess where requests are generated according to a Poisso\n. We model the teleportation as a queuing\nprocess where requests are generated according to a Poisson\nprocess with rate \u0015and the EPR are also generated according\nto a poisson process with rate \u0016. This allows us to calculate the\nwait times in memory through the use of simple continuous\ntime Markov models.\nThe average ﬁdelity of a node depends on load, dephasing\nrate, memory size, and serving discipline. Because the relation\nbetween ﬁdelity and time is not linear, the order in which\nrequests are served can affect the ﬁdelity. Even when the\naverage wait times of two service disciplines are the same,\nthe average ﬁdelities that they can be different. We consider\nbothFIFO andLIFO disciplines with both ﬁnite and inﬁnite\nbuffer variants: First in First out with inﬁnite buffer( FIFO ),\nLast in First out inﬁnite buffer( LIFO ), FIFO with ﬁnite buffer\nand pushout ( FIFO-PO ), LIFO with ﬁnite Buffer( LIFO-PO ).\nIn the case of a ﬁnite buffer, pushout means that if a request\narrives to a full buffer, the oldest request in the buffer is kicked\nout to make space for the incoming qubit. We consider pushout\nbecause intuitively it optimizes for ﬁdelity as older requests i.e.\nqubits that have suffered the most decoherence are kicked out.\nWe give a proof that LIFO PO is indeed the optimal discipline\nfor optimizing ﬁdelity.\nWe consider a scenario where we have two memory plat-\nforms available to us, One for storing teleportation requests\nand one for caching EPR pairs. We model this as two com-\npeting queues where at least one is always empty. Lastly, we\nextend this model to show how this can be applied to calculate\nthe average ﬁdelity of the teleportation channel created by a\nsingle repeater chain. The novelty in our construction stems\nfrom its simplicity and ﬂexibility for calculating ﬁdelity distri-\nbutions. It also considers the effects of scheduling disciplines\nwhich, to the authors knowledge, at the time of writing have\nnot been considered in quantum networks. The ﬂexibility of\nthis\nowledge, at the time of writing have\nnot been considered in quantum networks. The ﬂexibility of\nthis model also allows for easy extensions to different noise\nmodels, probability distributions etc. This leads to natural\nfuture work in integrating elements from different works. We\nwill go further into this in section VII-A.\nA. Related work\nAs stated previously the analysis and modelling of quantum\nnetwork devices is an active ﬁeld of study. There have been\na lot of studies on modelling switches and repeaters to\nanalyse and design protocols [1], [2], but these studies focus\nEntanglement generation capacity regions not on ﬁdelity. [3]\nfocuses on ﬁdelity of EPR pairs generated by repeater chains\nof different lengths but it does not account for a continuous\nstream of requests so it can be seen as deriving a more\naccurate distribution for the EPR generation distribution for\na node at the beginning of a repeater chain. [4] analyses\nﬁdelity loss from wait times in memory using queues and\nis a very ﬂexible model as it also abstracts away hardware\nimplementations and protocols into tunable parameters, butit focuses mostly on local network on a quantum processor\nwhere as the model presented in this paper can be extended to\nmodel repeater nodes as well as other quantum nodes. They\nalso don’t consider different service disciplines considering\nonly a FIFO queue.\nII. S YSTEM MODEL\nIn this section, we formally deﬁne the process we are mod-\neling. We will deﬁne the parameters that govern our physical\nprocess how a memory platform in a quantum network node\nwill behave.\nConsider a node in a quantum network. This node is\nconstantly receiving information that it must process and\nthen teleport to another node. We assume this node receives\ninformation as pure state qubits arriving according to a Poisson\nprocess with rate parameter \u0015. Any time this node receives\na qubit, it must send it to some other node. It does so by\ngenerating an EPR pair between itself and the destination. We\nassume wh\nme other node. It does so by\ngenerating an EPR pair between itself and the destination. We\nassume whenever this EPR pair is generated, it is initialized\nas a pure state and has ﬁdelity 1. This may be a strong\nassumption, but we discuss later how it can be relaxed.\nDistribution of EPR pairs between two nodes is a stochastic\nprocess [5] where the probability of successful EPR pair\ngeneration depends on the distribution protocol and physical\nimplementation of the EPR pair generating platform. If we\nconsider a discrete time model, the number of time steps\nrequired to generate an EPR pair is characterized by a ge-\nometric distribution. If we consider the time for one trial to\nbe very small, and the probability of successfully generating\nan EPR pair also to be small, then we can approximate the\nEPR generation process by a Poisson process where the time\ntaken to generate an EPR pair is sampled from an exponential\ndistribution with mean \u0016. We deﬁne the ”load” on a node\nas\u0015=\u0016. We can then model the occupancy (number of stored\nqubits to be teleported and EPR pairs) of the memory platform\nas a continuous time Markov process (CTMC), and derive\nsteady state distributions or Laplace transforms for the time\na qubit spends in memory (wait time). We can then utilize\nmemory error models to obtain statistical descriptions of the\nﬁnal ﬁdelity of the teleported qubits.\nA. Memory Model\nA request qubit is stored in some noisy memory when\nwaiting for an EPR pair. If more requests arrive while one is\nalready in memory, a queue is formed. As stated previously,\nthis allows us to model the memory platform as a CTMC\nallowing for the calculation of wait time distributions. To\nquantify the effects of decoherence, we need a continuous\ntime noise model that captures information loss. We choose\nthe dephasing or the phase damping model [6] represented by\nthe operator \"(\u001A), where\u001Ais some density matrix of a one\nqubit system. It is mathematically deﬁned as\n\"\u0012\u0014\u001A00\u001A01\n\u001A10\u001A11\u0015\u0013\n=\u0014\u001A00e\u0000\u0000t\u001A01\ne\u0000\u0000t\u001A10\u001A11\u0015\n(1\nof a one\nqubit system. It is mathematically deﬁned as\n\"\u0012\u0014\u001A00\u001A01\n\u001A10\u001A11\u0015\u0013\n=\u0014\u001A00e\u0000\u0000t\u001A01\ne\u0000\u0000t\u001A10\u001A11\u0015\n(1)\nwhere\u001Aijis theijth entry of the density matrix \u001A,\u0000is a con-\nstant rate at which dephasing occurs in a given environment,andtis time elapsed. Dephasing noise is the most common\nnoise associated with memories and the results of this paper\ncan be extended to account for any error model as long as\nit can be expressed as a liner sum of exponentially decaying\nterms.\nB. Fidelity loss of a single qubit\nFidelity of some density matrix \u001Ato some pure state j iis\ngiven by the formula\nF(j ih j;\u001A) =tr(j ih j\u001A): (2)\nWe can use this with (1) to calculate the ﬁdelity of a single\nqubitj i=\u000Bj0i+\fj1iafter spending time tin memory. We\nget the formula\nF(t) =j\u000Bj4+ 2e\u0000\u0000tj\u000Bj2j\fj2+j\fj4: (3)\nNote that the ﬁdelity depends on the initial state of the pure\nqubit, i.e.,\u000Band\finﬂuence the ﬁdelity loss experienced\nby that qubit. We will need the inverse of this function to\ntransform the distribution of wait times to the distribution for\nﬁdelity.\nF\u00001(t) = \u0000\u00001(ln(2j\u000Bj2j\fj2\u0000ln(f\u0000j\u000Bj4\u0000j\fj4)):(4)\n1) Fidelity loss in a Bell pair: The effects of dephasing on\nthe ﬁdelity of Bell pair is well studied and is given by\nF(t) =1 +e\u00002\u0000t\n2(5)\nwheretis time spent in the system and \u0000is again the\ndephasing rate of the memory [7].\nDephasing causes the Bell state to turn into a mixture of a\nBell state and maximally mixed 2-qubit state I=4which can\nbe written in terms of its ﬁdelity to the Bell state as a non\nmaximally entangled Bell state:\n\u001Aw=1\u0000F\n3I+4F\u00001\n3j\b+ih\b+j:\nHereFis the ﬁdelity of \u001Awwith respect to the Bell pair j\b+i.\nThis is precisely the Fthat decays in (5)\n2) Fidelity loss experienced by a qubit due to teleportation\nby a non maximally entangled state: Teleportation using a\nmaximally entangled Bell pair results in perfect teleportation\nand no information is lost. This is rarely the case in practice\nso we take a look at how teleportation using a non maximally\nentangled Bell state state acts as a linear map on th\nook at how teleportation using a non maximally\nentangled Bell state state acts as a linear map on the input state.\nWe consider a Werner state \u001Awas the teleportation resource\nand use it to teleport \u001A(t)which is the density matrix for some\nrequest qubit that has spent ttime in memory. This allows us\nto represent the effect of teleportation on \u001A(t)as a linear map\n[8]:\n\u0003T(\u001A(t)) =1X\ni;j=0h\u001Eijj\u001Awj\u001Eiji\u0001Uij\u001A(t)Uy\nij (6)\nwherej\u001Eijiare Bell states, \u0003T(\u0001)is the standard teleportation\nalgorithm represented as a linear transformation and\nU00=I;U01=\u001Bx;U10=\u001Bz;U11=i\u001By:IfFis the ﬁdelity of the Werner state \u001Awwith respect to the\ntarget Bell state \b+, then\n\u0003T(\u001A(t)) =F\u001A(t) +1\u0000F\n3\u001Bx\u001A(t)\u001By\nx\n+1\u0000F\n3\u001Bz\u001A(t)\u001By\nz+1\u0000F\n3i\u001By\u001A(t)(i\u001By)y:\nThis equation can be further simpliﬁed to get an equation for\nthe ﬁdelity of a qubit being teleported by a non maximally\nentangled Bell state state both suffering dephasing errors for\ntimest1andt2respectively. Therefore the ﬁnal ﬁdelity of the\nteleported qubit is\ntr\u0000\n\u001A(0)\u0003T\u001A(t1)\u0001\n=1 +e\u00002\u0000t2\n2(j\u000Bj4+j\fj4+ 2e\u0000\u0000t1j\u000Bj2j\fj2)\n+1\u0000e\u00002\u0000t2\n6(4e\u0000\u0000t1j\u000Bj2j\fj2)\n+1\u0000e\u00002\u0000t2\n6(j\u000Bj4+j\fj4\u0000e\u0000\u0000t1((\u000B\u0003\f)2\u0000(\f\u0003\u000B)2))(7)\nIn the considered model, either the EPR pairs or the request\nqubits have to be stored in memory so if t1\u003E0thent2= 0\nand vice versa. Therefore, we further simplify (7) in these\ncases. Ift1= 0, the error in teleportation is only due to\ndephasing suffered by the EPR pair, the formula simpliﬁes\nto\nF2(t) =3 +c1\n6+3\u0000c1\n6e\u00002\u0000t; t\u00150\nwherec1= 1+2(j\u000Bj2j\fj2\u0000(\u000B\u0003\f)2\u0000(\f\u0003\u000B)2). Whent2= 0,\nwe get the equation in (3):\nF1(t) =c2+c3e\u0000\u0000t; t\u00150\nwherec2=j\u000Bj4+j\fj4andc3= 2j\u000Bj2j\fj2. The key\nobservation is that the ﬁdelity is a linear sum of terms\nexponentially decaying with time. If time is a random variable\nand its Laplace transform with parameter s, denoted by T\u0003(s)\nis known, we obtain the equation\nE[Fi] =ci+cjE[e\u0000\u0000iT] =ci+cjT\u0003(\u0000i): (8)\nThis approach of using the Laplace transform to get the mo-\nments for the ﬁdelity is useful as in the processes we consider,\nit is easy to obtain closed form solution\nfor the ﬁdelity is useful as in the processes we consider,\nit is easy to obtain closed form solutions of the Laplace\ntransforms for the wait times than the actual distributions. This\nwill be especially useful when we consider models with ﬁnite\nmemory. In these equations ciandcjare decided by the input\nqubit being teleported. In this paper we will use j+ias the\nexample input qubit and\nF1(t) =1\n2+1\n2e\u0000\u00001t; t\u00150 (9)\nF2(t) =2\n3+1\n3e\u00002\u00002t; t\u00150: (10)\nThese are the simpliﬁed error models being considered in\nthis paper. All of the aforementioned functions are monotonic\nscalar functions of the ﬁdelity in terms of wait time of\na request. We can transform the random variable for thewait time into the random variable for the ﬁdelity. This is\nconvenient as many wait time distributions have analogues in\nclassical literature as we will see in the upcoming sections.\nIII. D OUBLE QUEUE MODEL\nIn this section, we consider a node that has a memory\nplatform available for storing multiple EPR pairs which it\ngenerates according to a Poisson process with rate \u0015e. Tele-\nportation requests arrive accordig to a Poisson process with\nrate\u0015r. We assume gate operations are instantaneous as the\ntime taken to perform gate operations is orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the time taken to generate an EPR pair. This\nprocess can be modeled as two competing queues where the\nservice rate for one queue is the request rate for another.\nThe memory platform for the request qubits can store Br\nqubits and the platform for EPR pairs can store Bequbits. We\ncan model this as a CTMC with the state being the number\nof request qubits in the system denoted as N. We consider\na surplus of EPR pairs as having negative requests making\n\u0000Be\u0014N\u0014Br. This gives us the process presented in Fig.\n1 From its Markov Chain formulation,\n\u0019n=P[N=n] =\u0019\u0000Be\u001An+Be\nSince\u0019\u0000BePBe+Br\ni=0\u001Ai= 1,\n\u0019n=1\u0000\u001A\n1\u0000\u001ABe+Br+1\u001An+Be: (11)\nLetpeandprdenote probability an arriving EPR pair and\nrequest gets placed in a buffer, respectively. This means the\nEPR pair o\nty an arriving EPR pair and\nrequest gets placed in a buffer, respectively. This means the\nEPR pair or the request has no counterpart to pair up with.\nThen\npe=0X\nn=\u0000Be\u0019nandpr=BrX\nn=0\u0019n:\nLetPs;randPs;ebe the probabilities that a request qubit is\nteleported and an EPR pair is used, respectively.

In phase\n1 request qubits are stored in memory waiting for EPR pairs\nand suffer decoherence during the wait. In phase 2 EPR pairs\nqueue up in memory and wait for requests to arrive that they\ncan teleport. The system alternates between these two phases\nso ﬁdelity loss suffered by the teleported qubit is sometimes\ndue to decoherence of request qubit and sometimes due to the\ndecoherence EPR pair but never both due to the assumption\nthat gate operation are instantaneous and error free and initially\nboth the request qubit and EPR pair are pure states. This means\nwe can individually analyse the ﬁdelity loss for each phase and\nthen derive a joint distribution by conditioning on the phase.\nLet us take a closer look at the process happening in one\nphase. If we restrict ourselves to one phase, the memory\u0000Be\u00002 0 1 ::::\u00001 Br 2::::\u0015r\u0015r\u0015r \u0015r\u0015r \u0015r\u0015r\u0015r\n\u0015e\u0015e\u0015e\u0015e\u0015e\u0015e\u0015e\u0015e\nFig. 1: Markov Chain formulation of Double Queue model\nwith buffer size Befor EPR pairs and Brfor request qubits\nplatform behaves like a standard ﬁnite buffer M/M/1. Now\nwe know from queuing theory that different orders of service\nfor buffered requests and EPR pairs lead to different wait\ntime distributions. If we have have the wait time distributions,\nwe can easily derive ﬁdelity distributions using a Jacobian\ntransformation. When it is too complex to explicitly derive\nthe wait time distribution and it is usually straightforward to\ncalculate the Laplace transform for the wait time and use it to\ncalculate average\nstraightforward to\ncalculate the Laplace transform for the wait time and use it to\ncalculate average ﬁdelity.\nLetfWi(t)be the probability density function (pdf) for the\nwait time incurred by a random request during phase i=\n1;2. The qubit ﬁdelity distribution will depend on whether\nthe request qubit or the EPR pair incurred the wait (phases 1\nand 2). In our case, we will use (9) or (10) depending on what\ntype of qubit we are considering.\nfFi(x) =fW\u0000\nF\u00001\ni(x)\u0001\f\f\f\fd\ndy\u0000\nF\u00001\ni(x)\u0001\f\f\f\f:\nWe also deﬁne W\u0003\ni(s) =E[e\u0000st], i.e., the Laplace transform\nof the wait time during phase i= 1;2. We use (8) to calculate\nE[Fi]givenW\u0003\ni.\nIn the next section, we give explicit expressions for fFi(t)or\nW\u0003\ni(s)for four memory platforms differentiated by the type of\nmemory management or service discipline used. Meanwhile,\nassuming we have descriptions for the wait time of the two\nindividual queues, we can get the joint probability distribution\nof ﬁdelity of served requests accounting for both phases by\nadding the conditional distributions of ﬁdelity of a served\nrequest which waited in a particular queue and normalizing\nit. We get the expression\nfF(x) =\u0015epePs;efFe(x) +\u0015rprPs;rfFr(x)\n\u0015epePs;e+\u0015rprPs;r: (13)\nTherefore,\nE[F] =\u0015epePs;eE[Fe] +\u0015rprPs;rE[Fr]\n\u0015epePs;e+\u0015rprPs;r: (14)\nThis expression is very ﬂexible as it allows us to calculate\nthe average ﬁdelity for double queue models even if the\nmemory platforms have different decoherence rates, buffer\nsizes, control etc in a modular manner\nIV. S INGLE QUEUE MODELS\nIn this section, we take a closer look at the phases mentioned\nin the previous section by focusing on a single memory\nplatform for the incoming “request” and has no memory for\nthe “service”. Applied to the double queue model we needRequest cycle EPR cycle\nt\nFig. 2: Typical teleportation behavior.\nto be careful whether the “request” is an actual request qubit\nor an EPR pair as they will ﬂip depending on which phase\nwe are in. Once the request arrives in memory, it waits for\nservice. As s\np depending on which phase\nwe are in. Once the request arrives in memory, it waits for\nservice. As stated before inter arrival and service times are\nsampled from exponential distributions making this identical\nto an M/M/1 queue. We will now take a look at ﬁve different\nkinds of queues each modelling a different kind of memory\ncontrol for the platform\nA. Inﬁnite buffer model. FIFO\nThe buffer size is inﬁnite in this system and no incoming\nrequest is blocked. The buffer serves the qubits in a FIFO\ndiscipline. We know from literature [12] that\nfW(t) = (\u0015e\u0000\u0015r)e\u0000(\u0015e\u0000\u0015r)t; t\u00150\nwhere\u0015ris the arrival rate and \u0015eis the service rate. We\ncan transform this into the probability density function for the\nﬁdelity using the formula derived in (3) as the function is\nscalar and monotonic to get\nfF(x) =(\u0015e\u0000\u0015r)\nexp(lnj\u000Bj4+j\fj4\u0000lnx\u00002j\u000Bj2j\fj2)(\u0015e\u0000\u0015r)=\u0000\n\u0001j\u0000\u00001\n(j\u000Bj4+j\fj4\u0000x)j\n(15)\nThe Laplace transform for fW(t)is\nW\u0003(\u0000) =\u0015e\u0000\u0015r\n\u0015e\u0000\u0015r\u0000\u0000: (16)\nOne key thing about this model is that it is only valid if\n\u0015r\u003C \u0015eas the queue will just keep growing and there will\nbe no steady state. If we are optimising for ﬁdelity, we need\nto minimise wait times. Serving in LIFO discipline intuitively\nmakes more sense especially at higher loads, as we want to\nprioritise younger requests.\nB. Inﬁnite Buffer LIFO\nThis is very similar to the previous model except that the\nderivation of the wait time distribution is different. In this we\nwill consider a system requests are served in a LIFO order\ni.e. the buffer is a stack. the buffer has inﬁnite length. We\nwill use the following parameters to model the system. The\nbusy period of a queue is deﬁned as the time period measured\nbetween the instant a request arrives to an empty system until\nanother request leaves behind an empty buffer. For an M/M/1\nqueue, the distribution of the busy period is given by\nfB(t) =1\ntp\u001Ae\u0000(\u0015r+\u0015e)tI1(2tp\n\u0015r\u0015e) (17)where\u001A=\u0015r=\u0015eis the load. Since a new request is always\nplaced in front of the buffer, the wait time distribution is the\nsame as the busy\n request is always\nplaced in front of the buffer, the wait time distribution is the\nsame as the busy period distribution [12], i.e.,\nfW(t) =fB(t): (18)\nWith the inverse of the function of ﬁdelity with respect to time\ng\u00001(f) = \u0000\u00001(ln(2j\u000Bj2j\fj2\u0000ln(f\u0000j\u000Bj4\u0000j\fj4)) (19)\nwe can now transform the pdf of wait time into the pdf for\nthe ﬁdelity\nfF(x) =fB(g\u00001(x))j\u0000\u00001\n(j\u000Bj4+j\fj4\u0000x)j: (20)\nWe also know the Laplace of the busy period and by\nextension of the wait time is:\nW\u0003(\u0000) =1\n2\u0015r(\u0015r+\u0015e+ \u0000\u0000p\n(\u0015r+\u0015e+ \u0000)2\u00004\u0015r\u0015e)\n(21)\nC. Finite buffer FIFO with pushout\nIn this section we consider a system in which the incoming\nrequests are stored in a queue with a ﬁnite maximum buffer\ncapacityB. If a request arrives when the queue is full, the\noldest request in the queue is discarded and the incoming\nrequest is stored in the queue. This makes the probability of\nservice for a requesting FIFO-PO dependent not only on its\nposition in the queue ( k) but also on the number of qubits\nbehind it (j) as it might get pushed out otherwise. We need to\ndeﬁne a new probability, Wr(j;k;t )which is the probability\nthat a request in position kwithjrequests behind it is served\nand its remaining wait time is t.\nWe know from results that the Laplace transform\nW\u0003(j;k;s ) =R1\n0e\u0000stW(j;k;t )dtcan be described by the\nfollowing set of recursive equations [11]\nW\u0003(j;0;s) = 1\nW\u0003(B\u00001;1;s) =\u0015e\n\u0015e+\u0015r+s\nW\u0003(j;k;s ) =\u0015r\n\u0015r+\u0015e+sW\u0003(j+ 1;k;s)\n+\u0015e\n\u0015r+\u0015e+sW\u0003\nr(j;k\u00001;s)\nW\u0003(B\u0000k;k;s ) =\u0015r\n\u0015r+\u0015e+sW\u0003(B\u0000k+ 1;k\u00001;s)\n+\u0015e\n\u0015r+\u0015e+sW\u0003(B\u0000k;k\u00001;s):\nThese equations can now be used to deﬁne\nW\u0003(s) =hBrX\nj=1W\u0003(j;k;s )i\n+W\u0003(N;0;s)\nSince this is a joint probaility of service and wait time. We\nneed to turn this into a conditional probability of waiting\ntime given the request will be served which we can getby normalizing with probability of a random request getting\nservicePsTherefore the Laplace would be\nE[e\u0000\u0000W] =W\u0003(s)\nPs\nThis can be used to calculate E[F]. Next we consider LIFO-\nPO.\nD. Finite buffer LIFO with pushout\nThe main difference between this sectio\next we consider LIFO-\nPO.\nD. Finite buffer LIFO with pushout\nThe main difference between this section and the previous\none is that incoming request qubits are stored in a stack\ninstead of a queue. We still discard the oldest qubit if a\nrequest arrives when it is full and the incoming request is\nput on the top of the stack. Unfortunately it is difﬁcult to\nwork directly with the wait time pdf. Instead we work with\nthe Laplace Transform. Unlike the previous model the wait\ntime only depends upon the its position in the queue k. Let\nW(k;t)denote the probability density that a request in buffer\npositionkgets served eventually and its wait time will be t.\nAssuming the head of the queue starts at 1, From classical\nresults,\nW\u0003(0;s) = 1;W\u0003(Bi+ 1;s) = 0;\nW\u0003(k;s) =\u0015i\n\u0015e+\u0015r+sW\u0003(k+ 1;s)\n+\u0015i0\n\u0015e+\u0015r+sW\u0003(k\u00001;s);\nW\u0003(B;s) =\u0015i0\n\u0015e+\u0015r+sW(B\u00001;s);\nW\u0003(1;s) =\u0015i\n\u0015e+\u0015r+sW\u0003(2;s)\n+\u0015i0\n\u0015e+\u0015r+sW\u0003(B\u00001;s):(22)\nThey can be solved to produce\nW\u0003(k;s) =r1(s)kr2(s)B\u0000r2(s)kr1(s)B\nr2(s)B\u0000r2(s)k(23)\nwhere\nr1;2(s) =(\u0015e+\u0015r+s)\u0006p\n(\u0015e+\u0015r+s)2\u00004\u0015e\u0015r\n2\u0015i:\nSince a new request arriving at LIFO always goes in the ﬁrst\nposition,\nW\u0003(s) =W\u0003(1;s):\nWe need to normalize this Laplace transform as in the previous\nsection with Psto get\nE[e\u0000sW] =W\u0003(1;s)\nPs:\nV. O PTIMALITY OF LIFO-PO\nWe have analyzed several memory management and service\ndisciplines. This raises the question as to which performs best.\nIn this secction we answer this question by establishing that\nout of a large class of work conserving disciplines, LIFO-\nPO is optimal in that it maximizes ﬁnal average ﬁdelity of\na teleported qubit. This result should not come as a surpriseas it is well known that, out of the class of work conserving\nnon-preemptive policies \u00050, LIFO maximizes E[f(W\u0019)]for\nany convex function fwhereW\u0019is the sojourn time under\npolicy\u00192\u00050for an inﬁnite buffer G/G/1 queue [9], [10].\nLet\u0019denote a policy that assigns requests to EPR pairs and\ndetermines what teleportation qubits and EPR pairs to remove\nfrom the respective buffers to avoid overﬂow. We ﬁr\nhat teleportation qubits and EPR pairs to remove\nfrom the respective buffers to avoid overﬂow. We ﬁrst observe\nthat there is no beneﬁt to removing a qubit from a buffer before\nit is full; hence we only consider polices that remove qubits at\nthe time overﬂow occurs. Second, we restrict ourselves to work\nconserving policies; those that always teleport qubits whenever\npossible. Let \u0005denote the set of such double buffer policies.\nWe introduce LIFO-PO , which always assigns the youngest\nqubit to be teleported to a newly created EPR pair or the\nyoungest EPR pair to a newly made teleportation request, and\nalways throws out the oldest qubit from the buffer when it is\nabout to overﬂow. A formal deﬁnition of this policy is given\nin the Appendix. Henceforth we refer to LIFO-PO as\r.\nTheorem 1:Out of the class of policies \u0005,LIFO-PO max-\nimizes average ﬁdelity,\nE[F\u0019]\u0014E[FLIFO-PO];8\u00192\u0005:\nwhereF\u0019is the teleportation ﬁdelity under \u0019.\nProof sketch. A complete proof is found in the appendix.\nHere we provide a sketch of the proof. The system can\nbe decomposed into two single buffer subsystems, one for\nteleportation requests, the other for EPR pairs. Let F\u0019\neand\nF\u0019\nrdenote the ﬁdelity for EPR pairs and teleportation requests\nrespectively. We show that E[F\u0019\ne]andE[F\u0019\nr]are maximized\nwhen\u0019=LIFO-PO . AsE[F\u0019]is a weighted average of\nE[F\u0019\ne]andE[F\u0019\nr], this establishes the theorem.\nFocusing on the request buffer, we condition on the ﬁrst\nndepartures of qubits from the request buffer, either due to\nsuccessful teleportation or removal due to overﬂow. Let w\u0019=\n(w\u0019\n1;:::;w\u0019\nn)denote the wait times of these requests. Because\nrequest qubits can be removed from the buffer without service,\nwe will assign wait times of inﬁnity to those requests. Let m\ndenote the number of these removed qubits. Our proof that \r\nis optimal is based on establishing the following majorization\nresult between w\u0019andw\r,\u00192\u0005,\u00196=\r,w\u0019\u001Eww\r.

Property (24) can now be applied with \u001E() =F()where\nF()is given in (9), (10), nallowed to go to inﬁnity, and the\nconditioning on arrival and departure times removed yielding\nE[F(W\u0019\nr)]\u0014E[F(WLIFO\u0000PO\nr )]. The EPR buffer is handled\nin a similar manner.\nVI. R ESULTS\nIt was proven in Section V that LIFO-PO maximizes\naverage ﬁdelity. We can visualize this in Figure 3. We plot\nthe average ﬁdelity of a teleported request with respect to load\nfor different service disciplines, FIFO-PO -LIFO-PO ,LIFO-\nPO-LIFO-PO andFIFO-PO -FIFO-PO . Buffer sizes are set\ntoB= 10 , dephasing rate \u0000 = 0:01, the EPR generation\nrate is\u0015e= 5, the teleportation request rate \u0015rbetween zero\nFig. 5: Plot for Probability a random request reciever service\nvs. load for a LIFO-PO -LIFO-PO queue.\nFig. 6: Plot for average ﬁdelity loss vs. load for a single\nrepeater chain for different buffer sizes following LIFO-PO -\nLIFO-PO .\u0000 = 0:01.\nand ten. We observe that LIFO-PO -LIFO-PO outperforms\nLIFO-PO -FIFO-PO andFIFO-PO -FIFO-PO . The reason\nfor the lower performance of FIFO-PO -FIFO-PO at low loads\nis explained by the fact that the EPR pairs are being queued\nup waiting for requests but s\nlow loads\nis explained by the fact that the EPR pairs are being queued\nup waiting for requests but since they have to be used in order\nof creation, the requests are served by stale EPR pairs rather\nthen fresh ones as is the case of systems that use LIFO-PO for\nthe EPR pair. Of course LIFO-PO -LIFO-PO performs the\nbest which is consistent with Theorem 1. Another thing to\nnote is the increasing nature of FIFO-PO -FIFO-PO . Since\nwe have a pushout mechanism for the oldest qubit in the\nqueue, increasing the load means a greater chance of older\nrequests being kicked out. In the case of LIFO-PO -LIFO-\nPO, we observe that as load approaches one, the ﬁdelity stops\ndecreasing and starts increasing. This because EPR pairs are\nserved more quickly and have incurred less decoherence.\nIn Figure 4 we explore the performance of LIFO-PO -LIFO-\nPOandLIFO-PO -FIFO-PO as a function of load for threeFig. 7: A single repeater between two nodes, It has two buffers to store EPR pairs and only one can non empty at the same\ntime. If the repeater has a qubit from an EPR pair in buffer A, and an EPR pair is generated between it and B, it performs a\nswap and discards the qubits.\ndifferent buffer sizes of 2, 5, 10. Here we allow load to vary\nfrom zero to two ( \u0015rvaries from zero to 10). In all cases\naverage ﬁdelity ﬁrst decreases and then increases.In the case of\na buffer size of 10, the minimum occurs close to a load of one.\nThis behavior should not come as a surprise as the time qubits\nspend in either buffer is the same at load one. The reason\nthat minimum average ﬁdelity does not occur at load one is\ndue to the fact that request qubits and EPR pairs decohere at\ndifferent rates and the asymmetry becomes more pronounced\nas buffer size decreases. Last average ﬁdelity decreases with\nbuffer size because increasing the size allows qubits more time\nto decohere before use.\nFigure 5 examines the behavior of probability of service\nas a function of load for the three different LIFO-PO -LIFO-\nPObuffer si\nr of probability of service\nas a function of load for the three different LIFO-PO -LIFO-\nPObuffer sizes\nA. Application to one repeater node\nIn this section, we apply the double queue model to a\nrepeater between two nodes A and B as show in Figure 7. This\nrepeater is constantly generating EPR pairs between A and B\nby generating EPR pairs between itself and A, and itself and\nB, and then performing entanglement swaps. Entanglement\nswapping is a form of teleportation one qubit of an EPR\npair ‘a’ using EPR pair ‘b’. This “swaps” the entanglement\nas now one of the qubits of the resource EPR pair ‘b’ has\nbeen entangled with the non-teleported qubit of EPR pair\n‘a’ and the original entanglements has been destroyed. This\nrepeater behaves like two queues with one queue modelling\nthe memory of EPR pairs between repeater and node A and\nthe other between the repeater and node B.\nOur teleportation model requires the following modiﬁcation,\nnamely request qubits suffer the same type of decoherence as\nEPR pairs. However, we get around this by assuming that the\nrepeater always teleports using the newest generated EPR pair\nas a resource. This ensures that the ﬁdelity of a resource state is\nalways 1. Since we are always teleporting with a maximally\nentangled state, the ﬁdelity of the ﬁnal EPR pair generated\nbetween A and B is equivalent to the ﬁdelity loss suffered by\nthe EPR pair which was waiting in memory as that qubit will\nbe perfectly teleported. The ﬁdelity of a bell pair dephasingwith time is given by (5) which is the ﬁdelity function we use\nfor both the queues.\nAs modeled before, EPR pairs are generated according to\na Poisson process and the time between consecutive EPR\ngenerations between the repeater and node xis sampled from\nan exponential distribution with mean \u0016x,x=A;B . Now\nassuming the router is equidistant between node A and node B\nand it uses identical technologies for generating the EPR pair,\n\u0016A=\u0016B. To keep it consistent, we keep the decoherence\nrate, \u0000 = 0:01. We plo\nenerating the EPR pair,\n\u0016A=\u0016B. To keep it consistent, we keep the decoherence\nrate, \u0000 = 0:01. We plot the average inﬁdelity deﬁned as\n1\u0000E[F]with respect to \u0016on a log scale in Figure 6. Average\ninﬁdelity decreases with increasing rate because when the rate\nis low, one queue receives a pair but since the other queue has\na low rate, the arrived pair has to wait a long time before it\nhas a counterpart for service. We also see larger inﬁdelity in\nlarger buffers but again this comes at the cost of a greater\nchance of rejection as seen in Figure 5.\nVII. S UMMARY\nIn this paper, we have modeled and quantiﬁed the effects\nof decoherence in a Teleportation Process, we model memory\nplatforms in networks as queues and utilize queuing theory to\ncalculate how much time a request has to wait for teleportation.\nWe then map these waiting times to ﬁdelity loss due to\ndephasing. This allows us to derive efﬁciently computable\nfunctions to calculate average ﬁdelity of the qubits teleported\nby a node. We consider a case where there are two queues\nto model caching of EPR pairs and provide a framework\nto extend results from classical queuing theory about single\nbuffer queues to the double buffer systems. We quantify\nhow serving disciplines can signiﬁcantly affect teleportation\nﬁdelities in NISQ era devices and calculate average ﬁdelities\nfor different disciplines. We prove the optimality of LIFO-\nPO-LIFO-PO for serving teleportation requests and compare\nit to other disciplines. We analyze the effects of buffer sizes\nand give a comparison of their Service probabilities. Lastly\nwe apply this framework to analyze the average transportation\nﬁdelity of a quantum repeater between two nodes and see how\ndifferent buffer sizes compare in terms of ﬁdelity and service\ncompletion probability.A. Future Work\nThere are many open questions and directions this work\ncan take. A most natural extension is to account for mixed\nstates as requests. One can achieve this by modifying (7)\nand use the ﬁdelity formula \nunt for mixed\nstates as requests. One can achieve this by modifying (7)\nand use the ﬁdelity formula for comparing two mixed states\ninstead of assuming a state is pure. Another direction would\nbe to use more accurate distribution models for the EPR\npair generation as in [3] and apply this model to longer\nrepeater chains. Another natural extension would be to model\na constant timeout policy so that if a request has been in the\nqueue for longer than some time Cso that we can guarantee\na minimum ﬁdelity for the teleported information.\nAPPENDIX\nProof of Theorem 1. We focus separately on the two buffers\nand focus on the amount of time qubits to be teleported and\nEPR pairs are allowed to decohere waiting to be matched up\nwith each other. Henceforth we focus on the request buffer\nand only on requests that arrive when no EPR pair is stored\nin the EPR buffer. We focus on the arrivals and departures of\nnrequests under policy \u00192\u0005. Leta1;:::;anandd1;:::;dn\ndenote the arrival and departure times for these requests.\nHere a departure corresponds either to a pairing with a\nnewly creation of an EPR pair followed by a successful\nteleportation or removal due to buffer overﬂow. Let m\u0014n\ndenote the qubits removed from the buffer. LIFO-PO satisﬁes\nthe following properties:\n\u000FThere exists no pair of requests j;kthat are served such\nthatak\u003Caj\u003Cdk\u003Cdj,\n\u000Fthere exists no pair of requests j;kwherekis served and\njis discarded such that ak\u003Caj\u003Cdk,\n\u000Fthere exists no pair of requests j;K that are discarded\nsuch thatak\u003Caj\u003Cdj\u003Cdk\nLetw\u0019= (w\u0019\n1;:::;w\u0019\nn)denote the wait times of these\nteleportation requests. Because requests can be removed from\nthe buffer without service, we will assign wait times of inﬁnity\nto those requests. Our proof that \ris optimal is based on\nshowingw\u0019\u001Eww\r,\u00192\u0005. Note that the standard deﬁnition\n[13] corresponds to the case m= 0. We introduce an operator\nTij, called the ” T-transform”, as follows. Let x2Rn\n+;\nTij=\u0015I+ (1\u0000\u0015)Qij\nwhereIis the identity operator, Qijis an operator that\npermutes \nllows. Let x2Rn\n+;\nTij=\u0015I+ (1\u0000\u0015)Qij\nwhereIis the identity operator, Qijis an operator that\npermutes the i-th andj-th components of xand0\u0014\u0015\u00141.\nIn other words,\nTijx= (x1;:::;xi\u00001;\u0015xi+ (1\u0000\u0015)xj;xi+1;:::;\nxj\u00001;(1\u0000\u0015)xi+\u0015xj;xj+1;:::;xn)\nIt is easily shown that Tijx\u001Ewxprovidedxi;xj\u003C1. Note\nthatx\u001EwQijx(\u0015= 0). Last, deﬁne the function Sj(x)as\nSj(x) = (x1;:::;xj\u00001;\u000Bxj;xj+1;:::;xn)\nwith 0\u0014\u000B\u00141. Thenx\u001EwSj(x).\nConsider the system with nrequests arriving at times\na1;:::;anand depart at times d1;:::;dn.We transform \u0019to\rthrough a sequence of steps that creates\na sequence of policies \u00190=\u0019;\u00191;\u00192;:::;\u0019h=\rsuch that\nw\u0019l\u001Eww\u0019l+1,l= 0;:::h\u00001.\nAssume\u0019lviolates the above property of LIFO-PO . There\nare three cases depending on whether the two requests are\nserved, one is served and the other removed or both removed.\n1)Both are served. Requestkis served before a younger\nrequestj,ak\u003Caj\u003Cdk\u003Cdj(we omit dependence on\n\u0019l). We construct \u0019l+1from\u0019lby switching the order in\nwhichjandkare served.

This does not affect wait times and w\u0019l\u001Ew\nw\u0019l+1:See Figure 10.\nThis procedure is repeated until the properties of LIFO-PO are\nsatisﬁed and, consequently w\u0019\u001Eww\r.\nWe ﬁxed the arrival and service times.

Inthe\nphotonic qubit architecture based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding, the generation\nof high-ﬁdelity graph states composed of realistic, ﬁnite-energy approximate GKP-encoded qubits\nthus constitutes a key task. We consider the ﬁnite-energy approximation of GKP qubit states given\nby a coherent superposition of shifted ﬁnite-squeezed vacuum states, where the displacements are\nGaussian distributed. We present an exact description of graph states composed of such approxi-\nmate GKP qubits as a coherent superposition of a Gaussian ensemble of randomly displaced ideal\nGKP-qubit graph states. Using standard Gaussian dynamics, we track the transformation of the\ncovariance matrix and the mean displacement vector elements of the Gaussian distribution of the\nensemble under tools such as GKP-Steane error correction and fusion operations that can be used\nto grow large, high-ﬁdelity GKP-qubit graph states. The covariance matrix elements capture the\nnoise in the graph state due to\ny GKP-qubit graph states. The covariance matrix elements capture the\nnoise in the graph state due to the ﬁnite-energy approximation of GKP qubits, while the mean dis-\nplacements relate to the possible absolute shift errors on the individual qubits arising conditionally\nfrom the homodyne measurements that are a part of these tools. Our work thus pins down an exact\ncoherent error model for graph states generated from truly ﬁnite-energy GKP qubits, which can\nshed light on their error correction properties.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPhotonicquantumtechnologies[1–4]provideapromis-\ning avenue for realizing quantum information processing\nin practice. A number of scalable architectures [5–8] for\nfault-tolerant universal quantum computation using re-\nalistically imperfect, noisy photonic elements, are being\nactively pursued experimentally [9–11]. Photonic, noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors are being\nutilized for demonstrations of quantum advantage over\nclassical computations, e.g., in the boson sampling prob-\nlem [12, 13]. Moreover, photonics is ubiquitously used in\nquantum communications [14] and quantum sensing [15]\nsince photons form the most natural choice for carriers\nof quantum information.\nQuantum information is most commonly encoded in\nthe photonic domain in the discrete, ﬁnite degrees of\nfreedom of single photons such as their polarization or\npropagation paths, or transverse spatial modes [16, 17],\nor frequency [18–20] or temporal modes [21, 22], or time\nbins [23, 24]. Deterministic generation of single pho-\ntons forms the key challenge in realizing these encod-\nings. Alternatively, encodings in the continuous, inﬁnite\nquadrature degrees of freedom of spatial, frequency and\ntemporal modes of the bosonic ﬁeld have also been con-\nsidered [25]. The class of Gaussian continuous variable\n(CV) states, such as the coherent states and squeezed\nstatesareeasilygeneratedusinglasersandquantumnon-\nlinear optics. CV quantum states are especially suited\n\u0003kausesh@pitt.edufor\nsinglasersandquantumnon-\nlinear optics. CV quantum states are especially suited\n\u0003kausesh@pitt.edufor the paradigm of measurement-based quantum com-\nputation since highly entangled CV multimode Gaussian\ngraph states [10, 11, 26] can be generated very eﬃciently.\nHowever, implementing universal quantum logic [27, 28],\nor any useful non-trivial quantum information processing\ntasksuchasentanglementdistillation[29]orquantumer-\nror correction [30] over CV states requires non-Gaussian\nelements such as photon number resolving detection or\nthird or higher order optical nonlinearities [31].\nIn 2001, Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill [32], intro-\nduced a hybrid encoding of quantum information in a\nbosonic mode, where an error-corrected qubit (more gen-\nerally a qudit) is encoded in the continuous quadrature\ndegrees of freedom of a bosonic mode. The GKP qubit, is\nprotected against continuous, small displacement errors,\nwhich is critical to realize fault-tolerant quantum com-\nputation using CV quantum states and measurements.\nThe resilience of GKP qubits against small displace-\nment errors also makes them resistant to photon loss er-\nrors that are encountered in quantum communications.\nIn fact, among all possible ﬁnite-dimensional subspace-\nencodingsovertheCV,inﬁnitedimensionalHilbertspace\nof a bosonic mode [33], the GKP qubit encoding is close\nto the optimal encoding for quantum capacity of Gaus-\nsian thermal loss channels with average photon num-\nber constraint [34]. This makes them suitable for er-\nror correction-based quantum repeaters [35, 36]. GKP\nqubit states are suﬃciently non-Gaussian that all qubit-\nlevel Cliﬀord operations can be deterministically and ef-\nﬁciently implemented using linear optics and coherent\nhomodyne detection [37]. The key challenge in working\nwith GKP qubits is that since they are ideal, unnormal-2\nized states, they can only be approximately realized in\npractice. There have been a few diﬀerent proposals to\nrealize approximate GKP qubit states and experi\nractice. There have been a few diﬀerent proposals to\nrealize approximate GKP qubit states and experimental\nimplementations as well in recent works [38–42].\nGiven a supply of approximate GKP qubit states, the\ngeneration of CV GKP graph states has important appli-\ncations in measurement-based quantum computation as\nwell as in all-optical quantum repeaters, where the graph\nstates play the role of quantum memories [35, 43]. This\ntask was investigated in Ref. [44]. However, the approx-\nimate GKP qubits were modeled as incoherent mixtures\nof ideal GKP qubits shifted by Gaussian distributed ran-\ndom displacements [45] that are strictly speaking still in-\nﬁnite energy states and hence unphysical. On the other\nhand, a coherent superposition of shifted ﬁnite-squeezed\nvacuumstates,wherethedisplacementsareGaussiandis-\ntributed is a truly ﬁnite-energy approximation of a GKP\nqubit. Anexactdescriptionofgraphstatesbasedonsuch\nﬁnite-energy, approximate GKP qubit pure states has\nbeen missing. This is accomplished in the present work.\nWe start by considering the error wavefunction descrip-\ntion of such ﬁnite-energy approximate GKP qubit pure\nstates given by a coherent superposition of a Gaussian\nensemble of ideal GKP-qubit states that are randomly\ndisplaced in phase space. Based on this, we represent a\nﬁnite-energy GKP qubit graph state as a coherent super-\npositionofaGaussianensembleofidealGKPqubitgraph\nstates that are randomly displaced in phase space, char-\nacterized by the mean displacement vector and the co-\nvariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution for the ran-\ndom displacements. Using standard tools from Gaussian\ndynamics [46], we track the transformation of these char-\nacteristics under the GKP-Steane error correction proto-\ncol and graph fusion operations that are used to con-\nditionally prepare large, high-ﬁdelity graph states com-\nposed of individual GKP qubit pure states. An impor-\ntant meritof thedescription isthatitprovides acoherent\nerror model for the GKP qubit grap\n An impor-\ntant meritof thedescription isthatitprovides acoherent\nerror model for the GKP qubit graph states, which can\nbe used to study their best error correction properties.\nA coherent error model could, e.g., be useful in design-\ning all-optical GKP-encoding-based quantum repeaters\nbased on graph states, and more generally for quantum\ncomputing with realistic, ﬁnite-energy, GKP qubit en-\ncoding. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we\nbrieﬂy review the GKP encoding of a qubit in a bosonic\nﬁeld mode along with its ﬁnite-energy approximations.\nIn Sec. III, we describe ﬁnite-energy GKP graph states.\nIn Sec. IV, we discuss an error correction procedure due\nto Steane [47], which is widely used for GKP qubits. In\nSec. V, we discuss two fusion operations, that are used\nto merge two subgraphs or modify parts of a graph. In\nSec. VI, we apply our description of ﬁnite-energy GKP\nqubit graph states to a graph state generation protocol\nto grow graph states. We illustrate how the description\nprovidesanaccurateacccountofthenoiseanderrorsthat\nbuild up in the graph state in the protocol.II. GOTTESMAN-KITAEV-PRESKILL (GKP)\nQUBITS\nConsider a bosonic mode described by its creation and\nannihilation operators ^aand^ay, such that [^a;^ay] = 1:\nThe corresponding Hermitian quadrature operators are\ngiven by ^q= (^a+ ^ay)=p\n2;^p= (^a\u0000^ay)=(p\n2i), where\nwe have chosen ~= 1. The eigenstates of these opera-\ntors are Fourier related as jqi=1p\n2\u0019R\ndpexp(ipq)jpiand\njpi=1p\n2\u0019R\ndpexp(\u0000iqp)jqi:The symmetrically-ordered\ndisplacement operator for the mode is deﬁned as\n^D\u0012u+ivp\n2\u0013\n=e\u0000iu^p+iv^q;u;v2R (1)\n=eiuv\n2^X(u)^Z(v) =e\u0000iuv\n2^Z(v)^X(u)(2)\nwhere ^Z(v) =eiv^q;^X(u) =e\u0000iu^p: (3)\nThe operators ^X(2p\u0019),^Z(2p\u0019)commute, i.e., they can\nbe simultaneously diagonalized. The ideal GKP qubit is\ndeﬁned as the 2-D subspace stabilized by these opera-\ntors [32]. The logical bit-ﬂip and phase ﬂip operators for\nthis qubit are deﬁned as X=^X(p\u0019);Z=^Z(p\u0019). The\nideal eigenstates of these operators form the b\n for\nthis qubit are deﬁned as X=^X(p\u0019);Z=^Z(p\u0019). The\nideal eigenstates of these operators form the bases for a\nGKP qubit and are given by\njsign((\u00001)kp)i=+1X\nn=\u00001j(2n+kp)p\u0019ip; kp2f0;1g(4)\njkqi=+1X\nn=\u00001j(2n+kq)p\u0019iq; kq2f0;1g;\n(5)\nrespectively. It can be easily shown using the Poisson\nsummation formula that the states of (5) are uniform co-\nherentsuperpositionsofthestatesin(4)withappropriate\nphases, and vice versa. Moreover, the Wigner function\nof a uniform incoherent mixture of the bases states in\n(4) or (5), i.e., e.g.,\u0000\nj0ih0j+j1ih1j\u0001\n=2, is a collection of\ndelta function peaks that lie on a square lattice of spac-\ningp\u0019in phase space. For this reason, the qubit that\nthey deﬁne is referred to as a square-lattice GKP qubit.\nSince the ideal square-lattice GKP qubit-basis states\ndeﬁned above are inﬁnite superpositions of periodically\ndisplaced, inﬁnite energy quadrature eigenstates, they\nare unnormalizable and unphysical. We can deﬁne ﬁnite-\nenergy approximations of GKP qubit states as superposi-\ntions of periodically displaced, ﬁnitely squeezed vacuum\nstates of variance \u001B2=2(where\u001B2= 1corresponds to the\nvacuum), weighted by a Gaussian envelope function of\nvariance 2=\u001B2, which therefore have ﬁnite energy, e.g.,\njekqi/+1X\nn=\u00001e\u0000\u001B2((2n+kq)p\u0019)2\n2 ^X((2n+kq)p\u0019)\n\u00021\n(\u0019\u001B2)1=4Z+1\n\u00001dqe\u0000q2\n2\u001B2j0iq; kq2f0;1g;(6)3\nand likewise thejekpistates.

In other words, we can represent\njg\tGi\u0011G(V;E;~ \u0016q;~ \u0016p;V).\nEvidently, if large graph states are generated from\nindividual ﬁnite-energy approximate GKP qubits using\nCZgates alone, then the p\u0000quadrature variances of the\nmodes can quickly accumulate, rendering the state too\nnoisy. The next two sections discuss tools that help rem-\nedy this situation.\nIV. GKP ERROR CORRECTION OF FINITE\nSQUEEZED GKP QUBIT GRAPH STATES\nThe GKP Steane error correction is a procedure that\nhelps reduce quadrature noise in the ﬁnite squeezed GKP5\nFigure 2.

The black dashed arrow indicates a Controlled-\nNot gate.\nqubits at the cost of a possible mean displacement er-\nror. We will begin by describing the action of the pro-\ncedure on a trivial single mode graph state, i.e., a single\napproximate GKP qubit state of the form in (19), and\nthen generalize the results to a vertex of a larger graph.\nThe procedure involves a unitary interaction between the\n“data” qubit, whose noise along porqquadrature is de-\nsired to be reduced, and an ancilla that is also prepared\nin a ﬁnite-energy approximation of an eigenstate of the\nconjugate quadrature, but with presumably lower noise\nvariance than the data qubit in the quadrature of inter-\nest. We note that Steane error correction for the case\nof a single qubit graph has been previously discussed in\n[49].\nWe discuss GKP-Steane error correction for\np\u0000quadrature noise reduction here. A schematic of\nthe procedure is shown in Figure 2. It consists of\npreparing an ancilla GKP qubit (qubit A) in theje0i\nstate of (5) and performing the CV Controlled-NO\npreparing an ancilla GKP qubit (qubit A) in theje0i\nstate of (5) and performing the CV Controlled-NOT\ngateCXwith the ancilla qubit as the control and the\ndata qubit (qubit B) as the target. This is followed\nby performing a p\u0000quadrature homodyne measurement\non the ancilla and a feedback ^Z(gy)displacement on\nthe data GKP qubit, where yis the measurement\noutcome and gis a suitable gain factor. In this work,\nthe feedback displacement is chosen such that it removes\nthe measurement outcome-dependent component of the\nconditional mean displacement on the data qubit(s).\nTheCXgate in CV is given by the unitary interaction\nCC!T\nX =e\u0000i^qC^pT;whereC;Tdenote the control and\ntarget modes, respectively. In the Heisenberg picture,\ntheCXunitary transforms the quadrature operators of\ncontrol and target modes as\nCy\nX^qCCX= ^qC\nCy\nX^pCCX= ^pC\u0000^pT\nCy\nX^qTCX= ^qT+ ^qC\nCy\nX^pTCX= ^pT: (36)\nThe CVCXgate can be implemented using beam split-\nters and inline single-mode squeezers as described later\nin Sec. V.\nNote that the procedure for q\u0000quadrature noise reduc-\ntion would similarly involve an ancilla prepared in a je+iand theCXbetween the data and the ancilla qubits, but\nwith the data qubit as the control and the ancilla qubit\nas the target. This would be followed by a q\u0000quadrature\nmeasurement of the ancilla qubit and a feedback mea-\nsurement on the data qubit.\nA.p\u0000Steane error correction of a single\nﬁnite-energy GKP qubit\nInp\u0000quadrature GKP Steane error correction of a sin-\ngle ﬁnite-energy GKP qubit in a state of the form in (19),\nthe interaction between the data and ancilla approximate\nGKP qubits results in a two-mode state given by\nj iAB=CA!B\nXje0iA\nje+iB\n=Z\nduAdvA\u0011A(uA;vA)Z\nduBdvB\u0011B(uB;vB)\n\u0002CA!B\nXei(\u0000uA^pA+vA^qA)ei(\u0000uB^pB+vB^qB)j0iAj+iB(37)\n=Z\ndsAdtAdsBdtB\u0011AB(sA;sB;tA;tB)\n\u0002ei(\u0000sA^pA+tA^qA)ei(\u0000sB^pB+tB^qB)j0iAj+iB; (38)\nwheresA=uA; sB=uB+uA; tA=vA\u0000vB; tB=vB\nand\u0011AB(sA;sB;tA;tB)is the square root of a 4-variate\nGaussian distribution\n\u0011AB(sA;sB;tA;tB) =e\u00001\n2(~ xV\u00001~ xT)\n\u0019(det(V))1=4;(39)\nwit\n root of a 4-variate\nGaussian distribution\n\u0011AB(sA;sB;tA;tB) =e\u00001\n2(~ xV\u00001~ xT)\n\u0019(det(V))1=4;(39)\nwith\n~ x= (sA;sB;tA;tB); (40)\nV=Q\bP; (41)\nQ=\u0012\nlAlA\nlAlB+lA\u0013\n\u001B2;P=\u0012\nmA+mB\u0000mB\n\u0000mBmB\u0013\n\u001B2\n(42)\nWe note that CA!B\nXj0iA\nj+iB=j0iA\nj+iB:\nThe statej iABcan be equivalently written as [45]\nZ\ndsAdsB\u001FAB(sA;sB)Z\ndtAdtBP(tA)Q(tBjtA)\n\u0002ei(\u0000sA^pA+tA^qA)ei(\u0000sB^pB+tB^qB)j0iAj+iB;(43)\nwhere\u001FAB(sA;sB), andfP(tA);Q(tBjtA)gare the\nsquare roots of bivariate and univariate, real-valued\nGaussian distributions, respectively, denoted as\n\u001FAB(sA;sB)\u0018G1=2\nR((0;0);Q); (44)\nP(tA)\u0018G1=2\nR(0;(mA+mB)\u001B2); (45)\nQ(tBjtA)\u0018G1=2\nR\u0012\u0000mB\nmA+mBtA;mAmB\nmA+mB\u001B2\u0013\n:\n(46)\nThe latter follows by applying Bayes’ rule.6\nAncilla measurement and conditional post-measurement state\nWhen qubit Ais measured over its p\u0000quadrature, we\nget an outcome y2Rwith probability PY(y)and a con-\nditional statej\u001EiBjyon qubit B, that can be deduced\nfrom the conditional unnormalized state given by (see\nAppendix B for the derivation)\nphyjA:j iAB=p\nPY(y)j\u001EiBjy\n= 2p\u0019X\nne\u0000(y\u0000np\u0019)2\n2(mA+mB)\u001B2\n(\u0019(mA+mB)\u001B2)1=4e\u0000(y+np\u0019)2\n8(lA+lB)\nlAlB\u001B2\n(4\u0019(lA+lB)\nlAlB\u001B2)1=4\n\u0002 Z\ndsBdtBe\u0000s2\nB\n2(lA+lB)\u001B2\n(\u0019(lA+lB)\u001B2)1=4e\u0000\u0012\ntB+mB\nmA+mB(y\u0000np\u0019)\u00132\n2mAmB\nmA+mB\u001B2\n(\u0019mAmB\nmA+mB\u001B2)1=4\ne\u0000ilA\n2(lA+lB)(y+np\u0019)sBei(\u0000sB^pB+tB^qB)j+iB!\n(47)\nAssumingp\n(mA+mB)\u001B\u001Cp\u0019=2,thesupportof PY(y)\nis mainly concentrated around y=np\u0019; n2Z.

FUSION OPERATIONS\nIn linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) with\nsingle-photon-based qubits, graph states that are uni-\nversal for measurement-based quantum computing can\nbe created by combining small graph states using what\nare referred to as fusion operations acting on photonic\n12Figure 10. Fusion C: (a) circuit diagram and (b) its CV im-\nplementation for GKP qubits.\nqubits [50, 51]. Here, we \non C: (a) circuit diagram and (b) its CV im-\nplementation for GKP qubits.\nqubits [50, 51]. Here, we explore the CV analogues of the\nso-called \"Type-II\" fusion operations [50] from LOQC,\nwhich are rotated versions of maximally entangled two-\nqubit(Bellstate)measurements, toapplyonGKPqubits\nand fuse small GKP-qubit graph states to generate larger\ngraph states of arbitrary topology [52]. The fusion op-\nerations allow us to do so without rendering the GKP\nqubits in the graph state too noisy and prone to logical\nerrors as would be the case if they were to be gener-\nated withCZgates alone. Qubit circuits of three in-\nstances of Type-II fusion from LOQC, denoted as fusions\nA, B, and C, respectively, along with their CV analogues\nare shown in Figs. 8, 9 and 10. In these ﬁgures, Hde-\nnotes the Hadamard gate, CXdenotes the controlled-\nNOT gate and Zmeasurement denotes standard-basis\nmeasurement. The CV circuits involve the Fourier gate,\nbeam splitters, squeezers, and q\u0000quadrature homodyne\ndetection for standard-basis measurement. The \u0000\u0019=2\ngate denotes the Fourier gate, i.e., a rotation in phase\nspace that transforms ^q!^pand^p!\u0000 ^q.

The equivalence of\nthe CV circuits to the qubit circuits in the ﬁgures follow\nfrom the above the transformations of the input mode\nquadratures. Note that while fusions A and B require\ninline squeezing, fusion C can be implemented without\nit. Fusion C implements what is known as dual homo-\ndyne measurement, which is used, e.g., in CV Gaussian\nentanglement swapping.\nAn important distinction between single-photon based\nqubits and GKP qubits regarding the action of the fu-\nsion circuits is that whereas in the former the fusions11\nfail when particular photon detection patterns are not\nobserved at the detectors\normer the fusions11\nfail when particular photon detection patterns are not\nobserved at the detectors [51], the CV fusion operations\non GKP qubits always succeed unless post-selection is\nperformed on the measurement outcomes. Post-selection\non the measurement outcomes as part of the CV fusion\noperations could be performed in a manner identical to\nwhat was described earlier in Sec. IV A in the context\nof Steane error correction, to reduce logical errors in the\nresulting graph state qubits, but at the expense of ren-\ndering the fusion probabilistic. It is thus also possible\nto explore a tradeoﬀ between the success probability of\nGKP fusion operations and the ensuing logical errors in\nthe resulting graph state similar to the tradeoﬀ presented\nfor Steane error correction.\nWhen acted on ideal inﬁnite-energy GKP qubits, all\nthe 3 fusions mentioned above perform rotated Bell-\nstate measurements given by the set of projectors\nfj i;jih i;jj;(i;j)2f0;1g2g;where\nj 00i=j0;+i+j1;\u0000i=j+;0i+j\u0000;1i;\nj 10i=j0;+i\u0000j1;\u0000i=j+;0i\u0000j\u0000;1i;\nj 01i=j0;\u0000i+j1;+i=j\u0000;0i+j+;1i;\nj 11i=j0;\u0000i\u0000j 1;+i=j\u0000;0i\u0000j+;1i:(91)\nHowever, when acted on ﬁnite-energy approximate GKP\nqubits, the projections applied by these circuits are no\nlonger exactly equivalent. They result in conditional out-\nput states with error wavefunctions having the same co-\nvariance matrix, but diﬀerent mean displacements. We\nnote that the fusions are to be followed by suitable feed-\nback displacements on the vertices of the fused graph,\nwhich can be chosen in such a way as to remove the\ndependence of the resulting graph state on the measure-\nment outcomes. Similar to Steane error correction, it\nturns out that feedback displacements are required to be\nperformed only up to the second nearest neighbors of the\nvertices corresponding to the control qubit Cand the\ntarget qubit Tin the input sub-graph states.\nWhen two ﬁnite-energy approximate GKP qubit graph\nstates are fused using a fusion operation, the structure of\nthe resulting graph state is gov\nt graph\nstates are fused using a fusion operation, the structure of\nthe resulting graph state is governed by the action of the\nfusionontheunderlyingidealGKPqubitgraphstate. As\na result of their identical actions on ideal GKP qubits,\nall the three types of fusions mentioned above yield the\nsame underlying graph structure. It is the same as the\nstructure of the graph state resulting from the action of\nlinear optical fusion operations on single-photon-based\nqubits [53].\nTofurtherelucidatetheactionofthefusionoperations,\nconsider 2 graph states jg\tGji=\nZ\nd~ x \u0011Gj(~ \u0016;V;~ x )nY\ni=1eixixn+i\n2^X(xi)^Z(xn+i)j\tGji;\nj2f1;2g (92)\nof the form in (23), as described in Section III, and iden-\ntify two vertices CandT, one from each of the two sub-\ngraphs.

DISCUSSION\nThetoolsdiscussedinSectionsIVandVcanbeusedto\ngenerate fault-tolerant graph states starting from ﬁnite-\nenergy approximate GKP qubit je+istates. Ref. [44] pro-\nvided a protocol to generate graph states starting from\nmixed state GKP qubits that are deﬁned as incoher-\nent Gaussian mixtures of randomly displaced ideal GKP\nqubit states. Such states can be obtained from the pure\nﬁnite-energy GKP qubit states considered in this work\nby a Gaussian displacement twirling operation, and thus\nby the data-processing inequality, are more noisy. An\napproach similar to the one in Ref.\n, and thus\nby the data-processing inequality, are more noisy. An\napproach similar to the one in Ref. [44] can be adopted\nto generate universal GKP graph states from the pure,\nﬁnite energy approximate GKP qubit states considered\nhere using fusions and Steane error correction in a bal-\nlistic fashion similar to discrete-variable linear optical\nschemes [43].\nAs a demonstration of our analysis, we look at the\ngeneration of a small 4-qubit tree cluster made of ﬁnite-\nenergy approximate GKP qubits, tracing the ﬁrst few\nsteps of the protocol followed in Ref. [44]. The protocol\nis described step by step in Fig. 11. While the analysis\nin Ref. [44] tracked the individual quadrature noise vari-\nances of mixed state GKP qubits, our analysis with truly\nﬁnite energy GKP qubits tracks the full covariance ma-\nFusion A\nFusion B\nFusion C\n0.01 0.03 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.210-910-710-510-310-210-1\nFigure 12.

Thisworkthus\nprovides a more accurate analysis of the errors that are\nintroduced during the graph creation from approximate\nGKP qubit pure states due to (a) the ﬁnite-energy ap-\nproximation, and (b) homodyne measurements that are\npart of the graph state generation protocol. Since the 4-\nqubit tree cluster generation as per the protocol involves\n1 steane error correction and 1 fusion operation, there\nare 3 homodyne measurements. This results in a total\nof8terms in superposition at the ouptut, which cor-\nrespond to ﬁnite-energy GKP qubit graph states whose\nerror wavefunctions \u0018G(~ x)are given by square roots of\nGaussian distribution functi\nph states whose\nerror wavefunctions \u0018G(~ x)are given by square roots of\nGaussian distribution functions with identical covariance\nmatrices of the form in (28) given in Table I, but with\ndiﬀerent mean displacement vectors, as tabulated in Ta-\nble II indexed by u;v;w2f0;1g.

We observe\nthat though the output states from the three fusions are\nnot exactly identical, the error probabilities are. The er-\nror probabilities can be further reduced by considering\npost-selected homodyne measurements as part of both\nthe Steane error correction and fusion, as discussed ear-\nlier in Sec. IV A.\nIn summary, we presented an exact description of\ngraph states composed of truly ﬁnite-energy, approxi-\nmate GKP qubit pure states in terms of Gaussian er-\nror wavefunctions. We tracked the transformation of the\nerror wavefunction’s covariance matrix and mean vector\nunder Steane error correction and graph fusion opera-\ntions that are used to generate high-ﬁdelity large graph13\nstates.

Quantum networks are complex systems\nformed by the interconnection of quantum processing\ndevices through quantum channels. In this context, char-\nacterizing how channels introduce noise in transmitted\nquantum states is of paramount importance. Precise\ndescriptions of the error distributions introduced by non-\nunitary quantum channels can inform quantum error\ncorrection protocols to tailor operations for the particular\nerror model. In addition, characterizing such errors by\nmonitoring the network with end-to-end measurements\nenables end-nodes to infer the status of network links.\nIn this work, we address the end-to-end characterization\nof quantum channels in a quantum network by intro-\nducing the problem of Quantum Network Tomography.\nThe solution for this problem is an estimator for the\nprobabilities that deﬁne a Kraus decomposition for all\nquantum channels in the network, using measurements\nperformed exclusively in the end-nodes. We study this\nproblem in detail for the case of arbitrary star quantum\nnetworks with quantum channels described by a single\nPauli operator, like bit-ﬂip quantum channels. We pro-\nvide solutions for such networks with polynomial sample\ncomplexity. Our solutions provide evidence that pre-\nshared entanglement brings advantages for estimation in\nterms of the identiﬁability of parameters.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networks are com\nr estimation in\nterms of the identiﬁability of parameters.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networks are communication systems\nformed by the interconnection of quantum processors\nwith channels that enable the communication of quan-\ntum information [1]–[4]. They extend the capabilities\nof quantum computers, augmenting the computing\npower of interconnected quantum processors with dis-\ntributed quantum computing [5], [6], and enable novel\napplications such as quantum key distribution [7]. As\nwith any quantum processing system, noise is inherentto quantum networks due to the fragile nature of\nquantum information.\nIn networking systems, noise arises both in the com-\nmunication of quantum information through channels\nand in the quantum operations performed by the nodes.\nThe diverse ecosystem of physical platforms for qubit\nimplementations, as well as the communication media\nused, have drastic impacts on errors introduced during\ncommunication, such that the development of technolo-\ngies to transduce quantum information is critical [8],\n[9]. With respect to communication, photons acquire\ndifferent errors when propagated through optical ﬁber\nand when propagated through free-space [10]. In the\nscenario of heterogeneous quantum networks that, for\ninstance, make use of satellites and optical ﬁbers to en-\nable quantum communication, characterizing commu-\nnication errors is central. For instance, quantum error\ncorrection processs [11] and entanglement puriﬁcation\nmethods [12] can beneﬁt from a precise description of\nerror models to improve efﬁciency.\nIn the context of characterizing quantum systems,\nthe theory of quantum estimation determines the fun-\ndamental limits to what can be inferred from measure-\nments and the efﬁciency of realizable estimators [13],\n[14]. Thus, quantum estimation is the key tool to\ndescribe errors introduced by noise in communica-\ntion in a quantum network. In quantum information,\nQuantum Tomography refers to a set of methods for\ninferring the description of qua\nntum information,\nQuantum Tomography refers to a set of methods for\ninferring the description of quantum systems [15].\nQuantum State Tomography [16] and Quantum Pro-\ncess Tomography [17] refer to methods that aim to\nprovide descriptions of quantum states and of quantum\nevolution processes, respectively. Hence, the natural\napproach to characterize errors in a quantum network\nis to use quantum tomography methods. In this case,arXiv:2206.02920v1  [quant-ph]  6 Jun 20222\nthe network would be treated as a black-box and\nprobed through the transmission of quantum states\nwhich would be measured to estimate the behavior of\nthe entire network.\nUnfortunately, such methods are not directly ap-\nplicable if one wants to characterize the behavior\nof individual network channels by using the network\nto transmit quantum information. Consequently, in-\nvestigating methods that use prior knowledge on the\ntopology of the network, as well as on the form of\nthe errors that arise from noise introduced by quantum\nchannel transmissions brings a new perspective to such\na tomography problem.\nExploiting prior knowledge to characterize channels\nin classical networks has been previously investigated\nand motivated the development of classical Network\nTomography [18], [19]. Classical Network Tomog-\nraphy refers to a set of methods that aim to esti-\nmate the status of network links through end-to-end\nmeasurements. The key idea is to transmit messages\namong users in the network with the necessary meta-\ninformation to measure classical quantities such as\ntransmission delay and packet loss. In the classical\nnetwork scenario, tomography methods that use both\nunicast and multicast communication were proposed.\nInterestingly, link correlations introduced by multicast\ncommunication in packet loss were exploited to pro-\nvide estimators for the loss probability per link in\nmulticast trees from end-to-end measurements [20],\n[21].\nA. Contributions\nThe goal of this work is to bridge quantum tomogra-\nphy with clas\nments [20],\n[21].\nA. Contributions\nThe goal of this work is to bridge quantum tomogra-\nphy with classical network tomography by introducing\nthe problem of Quantum Network Tomography. Our\ncontributions are as follows.\n\u000FWe formally deﬁne the problem of Quantum\nNetwork Tomography for generic quantum net-\nworks as the estimation of probabilities determin-\ning operator-sum representations for all quantum\nchannels in a network. The problem captures the\nend-to-end estimation of parameters by consider-\ning estimators based on measurements performed\nexclusively in the end-nodes.\n\u000FWe deﬁne a generic multi-party state distribution\nprocess for the network tomography of arbitrary\ntrees.\n\u000FWe solve quantum network tomography problems\nin star networks using the multi-party state distri-\nbution process deﬁned. In particular, we focus on\nthe case where channels are characterized by asingle Pauli operator, such as a bit-ﬂip channel,\nand provide estimators for network parameters\nwith polynomial sample complexity. Our estima-\ntors show that, even for single Pauli channels, pre-\nshared entanglement may provide advantages for\nestimation in terms of parameter identiﬁability.\n\u000FFinally, we show that our estimators attain the\nQuantum Cramèr-Rao bound and compare their\nperformance numerically for a particular star net-\nwork.\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows.\nIn Section II, we provide the necessary mathematical\nbackground to discuss our results. In Section III, we\ndeﬁne the problem of quantum network tomography\nand describe the multi-party state distribution process.\nWe report our results for the tomography problem\nin the case of star networks with channels described\nby a single Pauli operator in Section IV. Finally, we\ndiscuss our results and present concluding remarks in\nSection V.\nII. B ACKGROUND\nIn this work, we consider quantum networks to be\nsystems formed by the interconnection of quantum\nprocessing devices with quantum channels that allow\nfor communication of quant\nconnection of quantum\nprocessing devices with quantum channels that allow\nfor communication of quantum information. We do\nnot assume any particular physical implementation of\nthe underlying quantum channels, nor any choice of\nqubit platform. In addition, we use the term quantum\nprocessing device, or quantum processor, to abstract\nquantum computers, routers, switches and repeaters.\nWe represent a quantum network as a graph G=\n(V;E), where the nodes in Vdenote the quantum\nprocessors and the edges in Erepresent the quantum\nchannels interconnecting the nodes. In addition, the\nnode set is partitioned as V=VE[VI, whereVE\nandVIdetermine the sets of end- and intermediate\nnodes in the network.\nQuantum processors are assumed capable of per-\nforming generic, unitary quantum operations on its\nquantum registers and perfect quantum measurements.\nThis assumption implies that the only source of error in\nthe network comes from the transmission of quantum\ninformation through the channels. Despite being un-\nrealistic, assuming perfect quantum operations in the\nnodes is the initial step for the investigation of the\nestimation problems within the scope of this article.\nA star quantum network is a system consisting of\none intermediate node interconnecting nend-nodes. In\nthis particular case, we have jVj=n+ 1,jEj=n\nand each end-node identiﬁes one edge of the star. For3\nsimplicity, we label the intermediate node as node n\nand edge (v;n)as thev-th edge, for v2f0;1;:::;n\u0000\n1g,i.eVE=f0;1;:::;n\u00001gandVI=fng.\nIn what concerns notation, we use HKto represent\nthe Hilbert space formed by Kqubits, i.ethe Hilbert\nspace of dimension 2K, andDKto represent the space\nof density matrices of K-qubit systems. We represent\nn-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states as\n\f\f\bb\ns\u000B\n=j0si+ (\u00001)bj1sip\n2; (1)\nwheres2 f0;1gn\u00001andb2 f0;1g. GHZ-basis\nprojectors are deﬁned as \bb\ns=j\bb\nsih\bb\nsj. We use the\nstandard notation of [:;:] : [A;B] =AB\u0000BA and\nf:;:g:fA;Bg=AB+BA to respectively denote the\ncommutator and anti-c\nation of [:;:] : [A;B] =AB\u0000BA and\nf:;:g:fA;Bg=AB+BA to respectively denote the\ncommutator and anti-commutator operators.\nA. Quantum channels in the network\nThe edges injEjrepresent Completely Positive\nTrace-Preserving (CPTP) single-qubit maps. We as-\nsume that, for every edge e= (u;v)2E, the quantum\nchannelEv:D2!D2that interconnects nodes uand\nvcorresponds to the mapping\nEe(\u001A) =de\u00001X\nk=0\u0012ekUek\u001AUy\nek; (2)\nwhere\u001Ais a one-qubit density matrix, fUekgis a set of\nde2Nunitary operators and \u0012e2Rdeis a probability\nvector. We assume the channel models are known in the\nsense that the set of operators fUekgis known for all\nchannels. In precise terms, we assume prior knowledge\non a set of unitaries for which there exists a physically\nvalid operator-sum representation of channel ein the\nform of (2), for all e2E. In the case of the generic\ndepolarizing channel, (2) reduces to\nEe(\u001A) =3X\nk=0\u0012ek\u001Bk\u001A\u001Bk; (3)\nwhere\u0012e2R4andf\u001Bkgdenote the set of Pauli\noperators, with \u001B0=I. When channels are described\nby a single Pauli operator, (2) further reduces to\nEe(\u001A) =\u0012e\u001A+ (1\u0000\u0012e)\u001B\u001A\u001B (4)\nwhere\u001B2 fX;Y;Zgis one of the Pauli operators\nand the channel is described by a single parameter\n\u0012e2R. The description in (2) is general as it captures\nany physical process where a qubit state is indeed\ntransmitted from a node to another.B. Quantum estimation\nQuantum estimation theory addresses how measure-\nments can be used to obtain information from quantum\nsystems. There are three fundamental aspects of any\nquantum estimation problem. Assume that it is of\ninterest to estimate a parameter vector \u0012. First, it is\nnecessary to obtain a quantum state ensemble \u001Athat\nis parameterized by \u0012, what is normally referred to as\nparameterization. Second, it is necessary to measure\n\u001Ato obtain measurement statistics. Finally, we need\nto design estimators for \u0012based on measurement\noutcomes.\nSuppose that we are given a parameterized state\nensemble of Nqubits. In particular, let \u001A:RM!DN\ndenote the density matrix of the system that depe\nte\nensemble of Nqubits. In particular, let \u001A:RM!DN\ndenote the density matrix of the system that depends\non a parameter vector \u00122RMas\n\u001A(\u0012) =R\u00001X\nk=0\u0015k(\u0012)\u0003k(\u0012); (5)\nwhereRis the rank of \u001A(\u0012),f\u0003kgis the set of projec-\ntors for the eigenspace of \u001A(\u0012)and\u0015k:RM!Rare\n\u0012-dependent probability values for whichP\nk\u0015k(\u0012) =\n1. We are interested in the following quantum estima-\ntion problem.\nProblem 1 (Quantum parameter estimation) .Find an\nestimator ^\u0012for\u0012from measurements performed in an\nensemble\u001A(\u0012).\nThe measurement statistics used to describe ^\u0012will\ndepend on the measurement performed. For any set of\nPositive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) elements\nf\u0005lg, the probability of having outcome las a mea-\nsurement result is\np\u0012(\u0005l) =R\u00001X\nk=0\u0015k(\u0012) Tr[\u0003k(\u0012)\u0005l]: (6)\nThus, if the form of p\u0012is known, measuring an\nensemble of states described by \u001A(\u0012)withf\u0005lgyields\nestimators ^p\u0012(\u0005l), and ^\u0012can be obtained by solving\nthe inverse problem\n(\np^\u0012(\u0005l) = ^p\u0012(\u0005l), for alll;\nk^\u0012k1= 1:(7)\nThere are two aspects of such estimation problem.\nFirst, the number of equations obtained is the num-\nber of POVM elements. For projective measurements,\nthe number of equations grows as O(2N)because\nof the completeness relation. Second, the dependence\nofp^\u0012(\u0005l)on\u0012does not guarantee that the inverse\nproblem in (7) has a unique solution.4\nC. Estimation efﬁciency\nIn general, different parametrization processes pro-\nvide mixed states described by different density ma-\ntrices, which leads to distinct estimators ^\u0012for\u0012. In\naddition, different POVMs yield distinct estimators for\nthe same density matrix \u001A(\u0012). Thus, we analyze the\nefﬁciency of different estimators for Problem 1 with\ntwo metrics of interest: the identiﬁability of^\u0012and the\nQuantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) for\u0012[14].\nWe say that an estimator ^\u0012identiﬁes\u0012if it determines\na unique value for \u0012from a sequence of observations.\nIn the case of (7), ^\u0012identiﬁes the parameters if it is the\nunique solution to the inverse problem. The QFIM F\nof a density matrix \u001A(\u0012)\n parameters if it is the\nunique solution to the inverse problem. The QFIM F\nof a density matrix \u001A(\u0012)[13] is a semi-positive deﬁnite\nreal matrix with entries\nFjk=1\n2Tr(\u001AfLj;Lkg); (8)\nwhereLkis the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative\n(SLD) of\u001A(\u0012)with respect to \u0012jgiven by the dif-\nferential matrix equation\n@\u001A\n@\u0012j=1\n2(Lj\u001A+\u001ALj): (9)\nThe diagonal entry Fjjcontains the Quantum Fisher\nInformation (QFI) for parameter \u0012j. The QFIM yields\ntheQuantum Cramèr-Rao bound (QCRB) for multi-\nparameter estimation, which is a lower bound for the\ncovariance matrix of estimators based on statistics gen-\nerated by any POVM [14]. An estimator that reaches\nthe QCRB for the joint estimation of \u0012is attainable if,\nand only ifLjandLkcommute for all pairs \u0012j;\u0012k[14].\nFurthermore, consider the following simple theorem.\nTheorem 1. If\u001A(\u0012)is diagonalized by a set of \u0012-\nindependent projectors f\u0003kg, thenf\u0003kgdiagonalizes\nLj, for allj.\nProof. Under the assumption that \u0003k(\u0012) = \u0003k,\u001A(\u0012) =P\nk\u0015k(\u0012)\u0003kand@\u001A(\u0012)\n@\u0012j=P\nk@\u0015(\u0012)\n@\u0012j\u0003kfor allj. Thus,\nby taking the ansatz Lj=P\nkljk\u0003k, one veriﬁes that\n(9) is solved with ljk=@\u0015(\u0012)\n@\u0012j1\n\u0015(\u0012), for allj.\nFurthermore, when Theorem 1 is valid, LiandLj\ncommute for all i;jand an estimator ^\u0012from projective\nmeasurements on the f\u0003kgbasis is asymptotically\noptimal given \u001A(\u0012). Plugging the description for Lj\nfrom Theorem 1 in (8) yields\nFab=X\nk1\n\u0015k@\u0015k\n@\u0012a@\u0015k\n@\u0012b: (10)III. Q UANTUM NETWORK TOMOGRAPHY\nIn this section we rephrase Problem 1 for a net-\nworking setting. We begin by describing the problem\nof channel tomography, which naturally leads to the\ndeﬁnition of the network version. Consider the simplest\nnon-trivial network system formed by two end-nodes\nuandvconnected by an edge e= (u;v)representing\nthe quantum channel Eefollowing (2). The channel\ntomography problem refers to quantum process tomog-\nraphy ofEe. In it’s most general version, one does\nnot assume knowledge of the form of the channel in\nterms of Kraus operators that yield a physically valid\noperator-sum representation of\nthe channel in\nterms of Kraus operators that yield a physically valid\noperator-sum representation of Ee. Then, the solution\nfor this general problem is a set of unitaries fUekg\nand an estimator ^\u0012ethat characterize the operator-sum\nrepresentation.\nThis general problem is difﬁcult, since the unitaries\nmust be characterized from measurements, treating Ee\nas a black-box. We simplify this problem by assuming\nthat we know the set of unitary operators for which a\nvalid operator-sum representation exists and focus on\nthe estimation of \u0012. Thus, the formal deﬁnition of the\nchannel tomography problem of interest is as follows.\nProblem 2 (Quantum Channel Tomography) .Given\na set ofMunitary operators fUkgefor which the\nquantum channelEehas the form given in (2), estimate\na probability vector ^\u0012e2RMthat characterizes Ee.\nThe channel tomography problem is an instance of\nProblem 1 since, in order to estimate the probability\nvector, it is necessary to use the channel to prepare and\nmeasure an ensemble of mixed states that depends on \u0012\nto obtain statistics for estimation. In this case, uandv\nare end-nodes and can perform arbitrary measurements\non the ensemble, share the classical results of the\nmeasurements and compute ^\u0012e.\nThe quantum network tomography problem, which\nis depicted in Figure 1, extends the channel problem\nto networks with the caveat that only end-nodes can\ncontribute information for estimation. We now present\nthe formal deﬁnition of the quantum network tomog-\nraphy problem for trees, which is one of the main\ncontributions of this article. A tree T= (V;E)is a\nconnected graph with no cycles.\nProblem 3 (Quantum Network Tomography) .Given a\nquantum network with topology given by a tree T=\n(V;E), with nodes partitioned into disjoint sets VE\nandVIand a set of unitary operators fUkgefor each\ne2E, estimate a probability vector ^\u0012echaracterizing5\n(a) State distribution.\n (b) End-to-end measurements.\n (c) Collection and estimation.\nFig. 1: Quantum network tomography on trees. \nd-to-end measurements.\n (c) Collection and estimation.\nFig. 1: Quantum network tomography on trees. The tree shown is formed by two intermediate nodes and\neach channel is described by a Kraus decomposition of known form (Equation 2). The goal is to estimate the\nprobabilities describing each channel in the tree. (a) A mixed state \u001A(\u0012)is distributed from the root (node r)\ntowards the leaves lj. To perform distribution, the root and the intermediate nodes (small gray circles) transmit\na qubit state to its neighbors following arrow direction. (b) When all leaves receive qubits, measurements\nare performed to obtain classical data for estimation. (c) Finally, end-nodes transmit the classical data from\nmeasurements to a fusion center in the network, represented here by the root node, for estimation to be performed.\nEefor alle2Eusing measurement statistics from\nnodes inVeexclusively.\nThe main difference between Problems 2 and 3 is\nthe restriction that measurement observations used for\nestimation must come from end-nodes in the network\ncase. If such a restriction is dropped, the network\nproblem reduces to the channel problem and the best\nway to obtain estimators is to treat each channel\nindependently and solve Problem 2 for all channels in\nthe network. When the restriction is considered, joint\nestimation of the channel parameters must be carried\nout in the general case. The joint estimation reﬂects\nthe fact that channels must be jointly used to prepare\nan ensemble of states described by \u001A(\u0012)that can be\nmeasured by the end-nodes to provide statistics for\nestimation.\nA. Parameterization and State Distribution\nWith the formal deﬁnition of the tomography prob-\nlem, we propose a family of parameterization processes\nthat cast Problem 3 into an instance of Problem 1. In\nprinciple, the preparation of \u001A(\u0012)must target qubits in\nthe end-nodes for measurements to be performed. It\nis straightforward that such preparation must use the\nchannels in the network in order to make the ensemble\n\nghtforward that such preparation must use the\nchannels in the network in order to make the ensemble\ndependent on \u0012. Regardless of how channels are used\nto prepare the ensemble, the parameterization process\ncan be expressed as an abstract, multi-qubit quantum\nchannelN\u0012acting on a locally-prepared ensemble \u001A0\nas\n\u001A(\u0012) =N\u0012(\u001A0): (11)In our terminology, a locally-prepared state is any\nstate that is separable with respect to the nodes of the\nnetwork such that \u001A0follows\n\u001A0=O\nv2V\u001A0v; (12)\nwhere\u001A0vis a multi-qubit state located in a quantum\nregister in node v. Following the quantum process\ntomography nomenclature, we refer to \u001A0from now on\nas the probe state. The key aspect of quantum network\ntomography is that both \u001A0andN\u0012are allowed to be\nchosen as part of the problem’s solution.\nWe describe the abstract quantum channel N\u0012, and\nhence the parameterization process, with a process\nfor network state distribution. The state distribution\nproblem refers to the preparation of generic quantum\nstates across target end-nodes, using channels and\nintermediate nodes to propagate entanglement. In this\nsetting, nodes start with a state that follows (12), which\nis progressively transformed through local operations\nand quantum state transmissions across channels. State\ndistribution is a natural approach to deﬁne N\u0012because\nqubits transmitted across a link eevolve according\ntoEeand, thus, can be used to incorporate f\u0012ekg\ninto the density matrix describing the distributed state.\nThis process yields a quantum channel N\u0012that is a\ncomposition offEegfor alle2Eused for distribution\nof\u001A0to the end-nodes.\nWe propose a distribution process for trees (Algo-\nrithm 1) to distribute quantum states across the network\nwith properties tailored for tomography. Since trees\nhave no cycles, there exists exactly one path intercon-\nnecting any two nodes in the network. Furthermore,\nthe process uses each link in the network to transmit\na qubit among neighboring nodes exactly once. Such6\nprocess is general in the sen\network to transmit\na qubit among neighboring nodes exactly once. Such6\nprocess is general in the sense that it captures any\nquantum state distribution operation across trees under\nthe restriction that a single qubit is transmitted between\nthe nodes for distribution.\nThus, consider the following deﬁnitions. Let T=\n(V;E)be a tree rooted in node r. The height function\nh:V!Z+is deﬁned such that h(v)is the hop-\ndistance of the path connecting vandrinT. Let\nhmax= maxvh(v). A leafvofTis a node with height\nhmax. Let the set LT=fv:h(v) =hmaxgdenote\nthe set of leaves of TandH(k) =fv:h(v) =kg\ndenote the set of all nodes of Twith height h. Let\nthe predecessor of vbe the neighbor Pvofvwith\nh(Pv) =h(v)\u00001, which is not deﬁned for r. Let\nthe successor set of vbeSv=fu: (v;u)2\nEandh(u) =h(v) + 1gfor allvinTnLT, and\nSv=;for allv2LT. Furthermore, let Cdenote the\ndescription of a quantum circuit applied in the nodes\nof the network such that Cvis a generic, multi-qubit\ncircuit applied in node v. Given the circuit Cv, letnv\ndenote the number of qubits in Cv. Let\u0011:V\u0002V!Z+\nbe a function determining the index of qubits to be\ntransmitted between neighbors. \u0011(u;v)determines the\nindex of the output qubit from Cuto be transmitted\nfromutovafterCuis performed. Finally, let j0nih0nj\ndenote the pure state j0ih0j\nn.\nThe process in Algorithm 1 is understood as follows.\nThe inputs are the rooted tree T, a quantum circuit\ndescriptionCand a qubit index function \u0011. In order to\nsimplify the process description, we assume that the\ninitial local state \u001A0is encoded in the circuit description\nC, such that all nodes start with registers prepared in a\npure state of formj0nih0nj. The process begins with the\nroot note executing Cr. Note that, since the root has no\npredecessor, line 3 has no effect for v=r. Then, the\nroot sends one qubit from the output of Cr(j0nrih0nrj)\nto each one of its successors, and keeps nr\u0000jSrj\nqubits in memory. The function \u0011(r;v)speciﬁes which\nof thenrqubit states is transmitted from rtov,\nj\nqubits in memory. The function \u0011(r;v)speciﬁes which\nof thenrqubit states is transmitted from rtov, for all\nneighborsvofr. In the process description, \u001Avdenotes\nthe state prepared in Svand sent to v. Whenever\nnodevreceives a qubit, the channel interconnecting\nPvandvtransforms the initially transmitted state \u001Av\nintoEPv(\u001Av). Thus, node vapplies the quantum circuit\nCvto statej0nvih0nvj\nEPv(\u001Av)as input. The node\nproceeds by transmitting one qubit to each one of its\nsuccessors following \u0011, again keeping nv\u0000jSvjqubits\nin memory. The process terminates when all leaves\nreceive a qubit state from its predecessors. It is clear\nfrom line 6 of Algorithm 1 that each link in Tis used\nexactly once for distribution.The generality of the process described in Algorithm\n1 stems from the freedom of deﬁning both Cand\u0011,\nalthough it should be clear from its description that\nthe distributed mixed state depends on \u0012ek, for alle2\nE, as long asCvacts onj0vih0vj\nE (\u001Av)with non-\nseparable quantum operations.\nThere exists a direct mapping determining the form\nofN\u0012fromT,Cand\u0011, although writing the math-\nematical form for the general case is lengthy. In\nthe remainder of this article, we consider distribution\ncircuits with nv=jSvj+\u000Evrfor all nodes v2V,\nwhere\u000Evris the discrete delta function, what implies\nthat no qubits remain in the intermediate nodes after\ndistribution. Furthermore, we focus on the description\nof\u001A(\u0012)directly rather then explicitly writing N\u0012.\nIV. T OMOGRAPHY IN STAR NETWORKS\nIn this section we specialize our approach to star\nquantum networks. The star graph is a simple type of\ntree for which we can observe the workings of the\ndistribution process and study tomography in detail.\nWe consider a particular bi-partition of the nodes,\nwhere all leaves of the star are end-nodes and the\nintermediate node is the center node, as depicted in\nFigure 2. Following our deﬁnitions from Section II,\nthis implies that VE=f0;:::;n\u00001gandVI=fng\nfor a (n+ 1) -node star graph.\nStar graphs are simple in \n\nthis implies that VE=f0;:::;n\u00001gandVI=fng\nfor a (n+ 1) -node star graph.\nStar graphs are simple in the context of Problem\n3 because the distance between end-nodes is always\ntwo. In addition, we simplify the problem further\nby considering a scenario where all the channels are\ndescribed by a single Pauli operator following (4). This\nsimpliﬁcation helps both the description and evaluation\nof estimators without rendering the problem trivial.\nSuch class of channels sufﬁces to demonstrate the\ndifﬁculty of performing tomography in a network and\nbuilds intuition on how to approach the problem for\nmore complex channels like the generic depolarizing\nchannel, which is described by all Pauli operators. We\ndescribe our methods for pure bit-ﬂip channels and\ndiscuss how they generalize to channels described by\nthe other two Pauli operators. Note that we consider\nthe same Pauli operator to describe all channels in the\nstar.\nA. Tomography in the basis of Pauli operators\nWe start by describing a solution for the tomography\nin the star that uses states in the Pauli basis. Under the\nassumption of bit-ﬂip channels, we target states in the\nZbasis. The same analysis follows for the other single7\nAlgorithm 1: Tree state distribution\ninput : treeT; circuitC; function\u0011\noutput: distributed state \u001A(\u0012)acrossr[LT\n1fork2f0;1;:::;h maxg:\n2 forv2H(k):\n3vreceives qubit in state EPv(\u001Av)fromPv;\n4vperforms circuit \u001Av0:=Cv(j0nvih0nvj\nEPv(\u001Av));\n5 foru2Sv:\n6 vtransfers qubit state indexed by \u0011(v;u)in state\u001Autou;\n7 end\n8 end\n9end\nFig. 2: Star quantum networks with nend-nodes de-\npicted as large blue circles. Each channel jin the\nnetwork is described by a Pauli operator \u001Band a\nprobability\u0012j. The operator-sum representation for the\nchannels is written along the edges of the network.\nPauli channels by selecting a different basis according\nto the Pauli operator under consideration. In the case\nofZwe use theXbasis and in the case of Ywe can\nuse either the Zor theXbasis.\nWe are interested in the following distr\nis and in the case of Ywe can\nuse either the Zor theXbasis.\nWe are interested in the following distribution pro-\ncess based on Algorithm 1. The root prepares a single\nqubit in statej0i. Since the distribution process as-\nsumes that qubits are initialized in state j0i, the root\napplies the identity operator as a circuit, i.eC0=I.\nThe root transmits the state to the intermediate node,\nwhich receives the mixed state\nE0(\u001An) =\u00120j0ih0j+ (1\u0000\u00120)j1ih1j: (13)\nThe intermediate node applies the generalized Toffoli\ngate\nTn=j0ih0j\nI\nn\u00001+j1ih1j\nX\nn\u00001(14)\ncontrolled by the qubit it received on n\u00001qubits in its\nquantum register such that C(n) =Tn\u00001, what yieldsthe mixed state\n\u00120j0ih0j\nn\u00001+ (1\u0000\u00120)j1ih1j\nn\u00001; (15)\nThe intermediate node assigns its qubits to end-nodes\nfollowing the order of node labels, such that the qubit\nindexed byjis sent to node j+1, with 0\u0014j\u0014(n\u00002).\nIn terms of the inputs of the distribution process, the\nmapping function selected in the intermediate node is\n\u0011(n;j+ 1) =jforj2f0;1;:::;n\u00002g. The ﬁnal\nmixed state received by the end-nodes is the (n\u00001)-\nqubit state\n\u001A(\u0012) =X\ns2Bn\u00001\u000B(s)jsihsj; (16)\nwhere\n\u000B(s) =\u00120[n\u00001Y\nj=1\u000Esj\u0012j+\u000Esj(1\u0000\u0012j)]\n+ (1\u0000\u00120)[n\u00001Y\nj=1\u000Esj\u0012j+\u000Esj(1\u0000\u0012j)](17)\nwhere\u000Esjis the discrete pulse function equal to 1if\nthe bitsj= 1 andsj= 1\u0000sj. In this case, the ﬁnal\ndensity matrix spams all of the binary strings with n\u00001\nbits and is diagonal on the Zbasis.\nSince the density matrix in (16) is diagonal on the Z\nbasis and only the eigenvalues depend on the vector \u0012,\nit is easy to verify that the SLD Ljfor each parameter\n\u0012jis also diagonal on the Z basis. Thus, in the context\nof the QCRB, the POVM of choice to measure \u001A(\u0012)is\nthe set of projective measurements on the Zbasis for\nthe Hilbert space of n\u00001qubits, which is attained by\nlocal measurements of each qubit in the Zbasis.\nGiven that local measurements are performed by the\nend-node, we can write the statistics of ﬂips in each\nparticular bit as follows. Let Sj2f0;1gdenote the8\nmeasurement outcome of the qubit in node\n in each\nparticular bit as follows. Let Sj2f0;1gdenote the8\nmeasurement outcome of the qubit in node j. A bit-\nﬂip is measured in node jif a ﬂip occurs exclusively\non one of the channels 0andj. LetFj2f0;1gdenote\nthe absence or presence of a bit ﬂip on channel j. We\nhave\nSj=F0\bFj (18)\nwhere\bdenotes the XOR operation. Thus, the prob-\nability of measuring a bit-ﬂip in qubit jis\nPr[Sj= 1] =\u00120(1\u0000\u0012j) + (1\u0000\u00120)\u0012j; (19)\nfor allj2f1;:::n\u00001g. Using (19) for all channels in\nthe star yields a system of n\u00001ﬁrst-order, bi-variate\npolynomial equations over nvariables. However, all\nof these equations depend on \u00120and, if\u00120can be\ncomputed, the system reduces to a system of n\u00001\nindependent linear equations.\nThe dependency between SjandF0introduces\ndependencies between all pairs of variables Sj;Skfor\nall cases where \u001206= 0:5. This dependency can be\nexploited to obtain an equation for \u00120as follows. Let\nSjk=SjSkdenote the joint random variable obtained\nby concatenating SjandSk. Also, letPr[Sj= 1] =pj\nandPr[Sjk= 11] =pjk. The probability that any two\nﬂips are jointly measured by end-nodes jandkis\npjk=\u00120(1\u0000\u0012j)(1\u0000\u0012k) + (1\u0000\u00120)\u0012j\u0012k: (20)\nThe probability in (19) can be re-arranged to obtain\n\u0012j=pj\u0000\u00120\n1\u00002\u00120; (21)\nwhich is valid for all j2f1;2;:::;n\u00001g. Plugging\nback on (20) yields the quadratic equation\najk(1\u0000\u00120)\u00120+cjk= 0 (22)\nfor\u00120, where\najk= 1 + 4pjk\u00002(pj+pk); (23)\ncjk=pjpk\u0000pjk: (24)\nThe form of (22) is symmetric with respect to\nprobabilities since if \u0012\u0003solves the equation, (1\u0000\u0012\u0003)\nalso does. This inherent symmetry implies that solving\n(22) for a speciﬁc pair of end-nodes (j;k)determines\ntwo possible values for \u00120that are valid for the\nmeasurement results. More interestingly, the symmetry\ncannot be broken even when considering (22) for all\npairs of end-nodes.\nFinally, combining the system from (19) with (22)\ngives two vectors ^\u0012for the channel parameters that are\ncompatible with the observations. Following our char-\nacterization, the estimators obtained from this method\nFig. 3: Estimators based\n Following our char-\nacterization, the estimators obtained from this method\nFig. 3: Estimators based on outcomes from Zbasis\nmeasurements for a four-node star graph with ground-\ntruth parameter vector \u0012= [0:8;0:3;0:4]. The dotted\nlines show ground-truth values for the parameters. The\nestimators cannot identify the parameters and there are\ntwo solutions compatible with observations.\ndo not identify the parameters completely, since we\nhave two possible values of ^\u0012. Given the form of the\nsolutions, identiﬁability can be obtained by assuming\neither low or high noise regime for \u00120. In this case,\nit sufﬁces to select the solution of (22) that is greater\nthan 0:5in the low noise regime and the one the is\nsmaller in the high one.\nWe simulate a four-node star with bit-ﬂip channels\ncharacterized by \u0012= [0:8;0:3;0:4]to demonstrate the\nestimators using Zbasis measurements. We plot the\nestimated value for the three parameters with respect\nto the number of measurement outcomes used for\nestimation in Figure 3. The symmetry in the estimators\nappears in the form of the two curves obtained for\neach parameter. The two values obtained for \u0012are\n[0:8;0:3;0:4]and[0:2;0:7;0:6], and identiﬁability can\nonly be achieved by making an assumption on the error\nmodel.\nB. Tomography in the GHZ basis\nThe need to introduce another assumption to obtain\nidentiﬁability for the parameters motivates the search\nfor other estimators. We now proceed to describe how\nGHZ states can be used to address this issue. In partic-\nular, we deﬁne estimators that use global measurements\nin the end-nodes, which can be attained by pre-sharing\nentanglement among the end-nodes. One can argue that\nend-to-end entanglement is an important resource in\na quantum network, and using global measurements9\nintroduces complexity in the implementation of our\ntomography process. Nonetheless, it is of interest to\nthe scope of this work to analyze the beneﬁts that\nentanglement may provide in the network tomography\nsetting.\nA GHZ state is \nanalyze the beneﬁts that\nentanglement may provide in the network tomography\nsetting.\nA GHZ state is a maximally entangled state that\ngeneralizes the Bell basis to more than two qubits.\nFrom (1),nbits are necessary to describe an n-\nqubit GHZ state. GHZ states are interesting in this\nscenario because the state obtained after applying a\nPauli operator on one qubit of a GHZ state is also a\nGHZ state. Formally, the state j\bb\nsievolves under the\napplication of a Pauli operator \u001Bon itsj-th qubit as\n\u001Bj\bb\nsi=8\n\u003E\u003C\n\u003E:j\bb\ns\bsji;if\u001B=X;\nij\bb\b1\ns\bsji;if\u001B=Y;\nj\bb\b1\nsi;if\u001B=Z;(25)\nwheresjis a binary string with 1in positionjifj \u003E0\nand string 11:::1ifj= 0.\nThe instance of the distribution process used pre-\nviously to distribute a mixed state diagonal on the\nZbasis can be modiﬁed to distribute a mixed state\ndiagonal on the GHZ basis by simply changing the\ncircuit applied by the root. Instead of sending state\nj0ito the intermediate node, the root prepares the\nBell statej\b0\n0iand sends the second qubit to the\nintermediate node. This is achieved by the circuit\nC0= [H\nI;CNOT ], assuming that the CNOT gate\nis controlled by the ﬁrst argument. When describing\ncircuits with multiple gates, we use an ordered list\nnotation [;]to indicate that gates are applied on the\norder they appear inside the square brackets. We select\nthe second qubit to be transmitted just to simplify\nnotation because (1) uses the ﬁrst qubit as the reference\nbinary value in the GHZ state superposition. If this\nis indeed the only modiﬁcation considered, the mixed\nstate received by the intermediate node is\nI\nE0(\b0\n0) =\u00120\b0\n0+ (1\u0000\u00120)\b0\n1 (26)\nand the ﬁnal mixed state distributed is\n\u001A(\u0012) =X\ns2Bn\u00001\u000B(s)\b0\ns; (27)\nwith probabilities \u000B(s)given by (17).\nBy comparing (16) and (27), there is no gain in using\nGHZ states. This is intuitively understood by consid-\nering the fact that only n\u00001bits of the GHZ state are\nused to parameterize the necessary information, which\nis the same amount of bits used in the initial case.\nThus, the key t\nhe necessary information, which\nis the same amount of bits used in the initial case.\nThus, the key to obtain parameter identiﬁability is toslightly modify the circuit applied by the intermediate\nnode to transform equation (26) into the mixed state\n\u00120\b0\n0+ (1\u0000\u00120)\b1\n0 (28)\nbefore the intermediate node transmits. Departing from\n(28), the ﬁnal mixed state distributed is described by\nthen-qubit density matrix\n\u001A(\u0012) =X\ns2Bn\u00001\u00120\f0(s)\b0\ns+ (1\u0000\u00120)\f1(s)\b1\ns;(29)\nwhere\n\f0=n\u00001Y\nj=1\u000Esj\u0012j+\u000Esj(1\u0000\u0012j); (30)\n\f1=n\u00001Y\nj=1\u000Esj\u0012j+\u000Esj(1\u0000\u0012j): (31)\nThe implications of (29) for estimation are profound.\nFirst, measuring the phase of the GHZ state gives a di-\nrect estimator for \u00120for all possible values. Whenever\nthe phase ﬂip is measured, a ﬂip in the ﬁrst channel\noccurred. Second, since the bit string describing both\nGHZ projectors in (28) is 0, the bits obtained by\nmeasuring the ﬁnal mixed state characterizing the\nGHZ determines whether or not a bit-ﬂip occurred\nin channelj. In particular, assume that the state in\n(29) is measured in the GHZ basis, yielding the state\nj\bb\nsi. A bit-ﬂip occurred in channel 0if, and only\nif,b= 1, while a ﬂip occurred in channel j \u003E 0\nif, and only if, sj= 1. Thus, we estimate all the\nparameters in the network by computing the number\nof timesb= 1andsj= 1in the strings obtained from\nGHZ measurements in a given set of observations.\nIn order to transform (26) into (28) it is necessary\nto modify the circuits applied by the root and the\nintermediate node. The root circuit is incremented by\napplying the single qubit gate XHX on the qubit\nthat remains in the root after the CNOT, leading to\nC0= [H\nI;CNOT;XHX\nI]. For the intermediate\nnode, the circuit is extended with the application of\nthe single qubit gate HZ to the received qubit before\nusing it as the control for the generalized (n\u00001)-qubit\nToffoli gate, which yields Cn= [HZ\nI\nn\u00002;Tn\u00001].\nThe same circuit can be used to identify parameters\nforYchannels with a modiﬁcation on the estimators.\nWhen channels are described by\ndentify parameters\nforYchannels with a modiﬁcation on the estimators.\nWhen channels are described by Y, the intermediate\nnode receives the state \u00120\b0\n0+ (1\u0000\u00120)\b1\n1. The es-\ntimators must change when such state is transmitted\nbecause the phase bit band the string sdetermine\ntogether the occurrence of ﬂips is the channel. It is\npossible to verify that a ﬂip occurred in the ﬁrst10\nFig. 4: Esimators based on GHZ measurements for\nthe four-node star graph with ground-truth parameter\nvector\u0012= [0:8;0:3;0:4]. The estimators identify \u0012and\nprovide a single solution for the tomography problem.\nAgain, the dotted lines show ground-truth values.\nchannel iffb6=Ln\u00001\nj=0sj. Since the occurrence of a\nﬂip inE0can always be detected, it is simple to relate\nsjto the occurrence of a ﬂip in channel j. For theZ\ncase, it sufﬁces to add the (n\u00001)-qubit Hadamard gate\nH\nn\u00001to the intermediate node circuit, such that C0=\n[H\nI;CNOT;HX\nI;H\nn\u00001]. In addition, the n\u00001\nend-nodes receiving the qubits from the intermediate\nnode must apply a Hardarmd gate before measuring in\nthe GHZ basis. In this case, the bits characterizing the\nmeasured GHZ state provide direct estimators for the\nchannel parameters as for Xchannels.\nIn order to compare the performance of the esti-\nmators based on GHZ measurement outcomes with\nthe ones based on Zbasis measurements, we simulate\nthe same four-node system reported in Figure 3 using\nthe GHZ scheme. The results reported in Figure 4\nshow that the correct value for \u0012is identiﬁed and a\nsingle solution is obtained for the tomography problem.\nMoreover, the curves in Figure 4 are smoother than the\nones in Figure 3, what indicates that the variance for\nthe GHZ-based estimator is less than the one for the\nZ-based estimator.\nC. Estimators and the QCRB\nThe form of (16) and (29) ﬁts into the deﬁnition of\nTheorem 1, such that the QFIM follows (10) for both\nestimators. Moreover, we do not explicitly compute\nQFIM for the estimators, although it follows from\nTheorem 1 that we attain the \nt explicitly compute\nQFIM for the estimators, although it follows from\nTheorem 1 that we attain the QCRB in both cases\nbecause we use projective measurements on the basisthat diagonalize the SLD of all parameters. Finally, the\neigenvalues of \u001A(\u0012)are ﬁrst-order multivariate polyno-\nmials on both scenarios and evaluating (10) for such\nfunctions is straightforward, albeit space consuming.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nThe quantum network tomography problem deﬁned\nin this work connects quantum tomography with clas-\nsical network tomography and targets the characteriza-\ntion of channels in a quantum network. The problem\nextends the quantum channel tomography problem to a\nnetwork scenario considering that intermediate nodes\ndo not provide information for estimation. Further-\nmore, we addressed the tomography problem in the\ncontext of networks with tree topology. We described a\nprocess for state distribution across trees that provides\nthe necessary mixed states for end-nodes to measure.\nOur results for trees generalize to networks with arbi-\ntrary topology since graphs can be decomposed into\ntrees and our methods can be applied to each tree\nin a decomposition. The estimators given for the star\nnetwork with Pauli channels indicate that entanglement\nmay provide advantages for tomography. The estimator\nobtained from global measurements outcomes in the\nend-nodes identiﬁes the parameters without the need\nfor any additional assumptions, in contrast with the\nlack of identiﬁability observed for local measurements.\nSuch evidence motivates the description for the con-\nditions under which entanglement enhances network\ntomography, as it has been previously investigated for\nother quantum estimation problems such as quantum\nsensing networks [22].\nWe identify three clear directions for future work.\nThe ﬁrst refers to the investigation of the star system\nfor channels described by a single parameter and one\ngeneric unitary operator, as well as the case of the\ndepolarizing channel. As a second direction, \ne\ngeneric unitary operator, as well as the case of the\ndepolarizing channel. As a second direction, the de-\nscription of the estimator that maximizes the QFIM for\nthe star with single Pauli channels is of interest. Finally,\nframing the optimization problem to characterize the\noptimal way to partition a network into trees for\ntomography can bring insights on how our methods\ngeneralize to arbitrary networks.\nAcknowledgments —This research was supported in\npart by the NSF grant CNS-1955834, NSF-ERC Center\nfor Quantum Networks grant EEC-1941583 and by the\nMURI ARO Grant W911NF2110325.11\nREFERENCES\n[1] H Jeff Kimble.

However, the hardware\npath from nearest-neighbor-connection-based topological codes to long-range-\ninteraction-demanding QLDPC codes is likely a challenging one. Given the\npractical difficulty in building a monolithic architecture for quantum systems,\nsuch as computers, based on optimal QLDPC codes, it is worth considering\nadistributed implementation of such codes over a network of interconnected\nmedium-sized quantum processors. In such a setting, all syndrome measure-\nments and logical operations must be performed through the use of high-fidelity\nshared entangled states between the processing nodes. Since probabilistic\nmany-to-1 distillation schemes for purifying entanglement are inefficient, we\ninvestigate quantum error correction based entanglement purification in this\nwork. Specifically, we employ QLDPC codes to distill GHZ states, as the\nresulting high-fidelity logical GHZ states can interact directly with the code\nused to perform distributed quantum computing (DQC), e.g. for fault-tolerant\nSteane syndrome extraction. This protocol is applicable beyond the applica-\ntion of DQC since entanglement distribution and purification is a quintessen-\ntial task of any quantum network.

Quantum networking is a common theme in all these applications, such as\nfor employing quantum key distribution to enhance digital security, for connecting quan-\ntum sensors together to enable a quadratic gain in sensing precision, and for distributing\nquantum computation among multiple quantum processors to relax the burden of building\nenormous monolithic quantum computers. This work is primarily motivated by the latter\nrole of quantum networking. Indeed, for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), the\nbest codes for scalability are the recently proposed constructions of quantum low-density\nparity-check (QLDPC) codes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. They provide optimal scaling of the code\nparameters,\n\nparity-check (QLDPC) codes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. They provide optimal scaling of the code\nparameters, i.e., the number of logical qubits and the minimum distance, with respect to\nthe length of the code, and thereby form promising candidates for FTQC with minimal\nresource overhead. While topological codes such as the surface code are also QLDPC\ncodes, they encode only a fixed number of logical qubits even with diverging code size and\nhave suboptimal scaling of the minimum distance. However, they just require nearest-\nneighbor connections to build in hardware, whereas these optimal QLDPC codes require\nmany long-range connections. Even though the LDPC property means that each stabi-\nlizer check involves only a fixed number of qubits and similarly each qubit is only involved\nin a fixed number of checks, both irrespective of the code size, there are a large number\nof connections between checks and qubits that are non-local geometrically [7]. Thus, it\nbecomes very challenging to build such codes in practice for several technologies such as\nsuperconducting qubits.\nGiven such practical constraints, it becomes very relevant and interesting to explore\nDistributed Quantum Computing (DQC) : a distributed realization of these QLDPC codes\nwhere multiple interconnected medium-sized quantum processors each store a subset of\nqubitsandcoordinateprocessingthroughthemeansofaclassicalcomputenode. Naturally,\nthis means that all the logical operations and syndrome measurements on the coded qubits\nare now non-local, i.e., must involve multiple nodes. Such an architecture was explored by\nNickerson et al.[8] even a decade ago, but in the context of the surface code. The solution\nto perform non-local operations is to share high-fidelity entangled Bell and GHZ states\namong the nodes, perform local gates between code qubits and these ancillary entangled\nqubits, and pool the classical measurement results across nodes to assess the state of the\nqubits. For example, in the case of the surface code \nesults across nodes to assess the state of the\nqubits. For example, in the case of the surface code with each node possessing only one\ncode qubit, each 4-qubit syndrome measurement will involve one CNOT per node between\nthe code qubit and one of the 4qubits of an ancillary GHZ state shared between the\nnodes; this is followed by a single-qubit Pauli measurement on the ancillary qubit and\nclassical communication of the result with other nodes. The authors proposed to produce\nhigh-fidelity 4-qubit GHZ states by generating Bell pairs between pairs of nodes and then\n“fusing” them to form the GHZ state. The process involved multiple rounds of simple\nprobabilistic purification of the entangled state, which is in general inefficient since the\nnumber of consumed Bell pairs can be very large (and uncertain). While their hand-\ndesigned purification schemes have been extended by algorithmic procedures recently [9,\n10], the approach still suffers from this inefficiency arising from the heralded nature of the\nprotocol. We will discuss comparisons to past work on GHZ purification after we present\nour results in the next section.\nOur goal in this paper is to investigate a principled and systematic procedure to purify\n(or distill) GHZ states using quantum error correcting codes (QECCs). If one can use the\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 2same QLDPC codes that DQC will employ for FTQC (“compute code”) to also store logical\nGHZ ancillary states, then these can potentially be directly interacted with the compute\ncode for performing fault-tolerant (e.g., Steane) syndrome extraction and measurement-\nbased methods for logical operations. Thus, it is very pertinent to develop a scalable GHZ\npurification protocol using these optimal QLDPC codes (“purification code”). While DQC\nis a key motivation, such a protocol serves a much wider purpose, since entanglement\ngeneration, distribution and purification form the cornerstone of quantum networkin\nnce entanglement\ngeneration, distribution and purification form the cornerstone of quantum networking. For\nefficient and scalable quantum networks, one must necessarily deploy quantum repeaters\nwhose primary function is to help entangle different subsets of parties in the network. In\nthe long-run, third generation quantum repeaters will use quantum error correction for\nentanglement purification [11]. Such repeater nodes, and other nodes of the network that\nare not quantum computers, will still need to possess a fault-tolerant quantum memory\nto generate and store (shares of) high-fidelity entangled states. Therefore, if the compute\nnodes will deploy QLDPC codes, then QLDPC purification codes could potentially unify\nthe functioning of different parts of the network and enable seamless integration.\n2 Main Results and Discussion\nEntanglement purification is a well-studied problem in quantum information, where one\ntypically starts with ncopies of a noisy Bell pair, or a general mixed state, and distills k\nBell pairs of higher fidelity [12]. Several teams of researchers have worked on this problem,\nand the contributions range from fundamental limits [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] to simple and\npractical protocols [9, 13, 18, 19]. Of course, if one can distill Bell pairs, then these can\nbe “fused” in sequence to entangle multiple parties, but direct distillation of an entangled\nresource between all parties can be more efficient [20]. Some purification schemes involve\ntwo-way communications between the involved parties while others only need one-way\ncommunication. We focus on one-way schemes in this paper. The connection between\none-way entanglement purification protocols (1-EPPs) and QECCs was established by\nBennett et al.in 1996 [13]. They showed that any QECC can be converted into a 1-EPP\n(and vice-versa). This framework enables systematic n-to-kprotocols where the rate and\naverage output fidelity are directly a function of the QECC rate and decoding performance,\nrespectively.\nage output fidelity are directly a function of the QECC rate and decoding performance,\nrespectively. Since the recently constructed QLDPC codes have asymptotically constant\nrate and linear distance scaling with code size [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], our work paves the way for\nhigh-rate high-fidelity entanglement distillation.\n2.1 Purifying Bell Pairs with QLDPC Codes\nIn 2007, Wilde et al.[18] showed that any classical convolutional code can be used to\ndistill Bell pairs via their entanglement assisted 1-EPP scheme. In the development of\nthis scheme, they mention a potentially different method to use a QECC for performing\n1-EPP [18, Section II-D] (without entanglement assistance), compared to the protocol by\nBennettet al.Initially, Alice generates nperfect Bell pairs locally, marks one qubit of each\npair as ‘A’ and the other as ‘B’, and measures the stabilizers of her chosen [ [n,k] ]code\non qubits ‘A’. Due to the “transpose” property of Bell states, this simultaneously projects\nqubits ‘B’ onto an equivalent code (see Appendix A.4). Then, she performs a local Pauli\noperation on qubits ‘A’ to fix her obtained syndrome, shares her code stabilizers and\nsyndrome with Bob through a noiseless classical channel, and sends qubits ‘B’ to Bob\nover a noisy Pauli channel. Using the transpose property, Bob measures the appropriate\ncode stabilizers on qubits ‘B’, and corrects channel errors by combining his syndrome with\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 4Alice’s syndrome. Finally, Alice and Bob decode their respective qubits, i.e., invert the\nencoding unitary (see Appendix A.2), to convert the klogical Bell pairs into kphysical\nBell pairs. Since the code corrects some errors, on average the output Bell pairs are of\nhigher fidelity than the initial nnoisy ones.\nAs our first contribution, we elucidate this protocol for general stabilizer codes [21, 22]\nthrough the lens of the stabilizer formalism [23], using the 5-qubit perfect code [21, 24]\nas an example. This approach clarifies many details of the protocol, especially from an\nerror correction standpoint, and helps adapt it to different scenarios. For the performance\nof the protocol, note that any error on Alice’s qubits can be mapped into an equivalent\nerror on Bob’s qubits using the transpose property, in effect increasing the error rate on\nBob’s qubits. Therefore, since only Bob corrects errors in this protocol, the failure rate of\nthe protocol is the same as the logical error rate (LER) of the code on the depolarizing\nchannel, with an effective channel error rate that accounts for errors on Alice’s qubits as\nwell as Bob’s qubits (as long as they do not amount to a Bell state stabilizer together).\nIf errors only happen on Bob’s qubits, then the failure rate of the protocol is identical to\nthe logical error rate of the code. For all simulations in this work, we consider a rate 0.118\nfamily of lifted product (LP118) QLDPC codes decoded using the sequential schedule of\nthe min-sum algorithm (MSA) based iterative decoder with normalization factor 0.8and\nmaximum\ndule of\nthe min-sum algorithm (MSA) based iterative decoder with normalization factor 0.8and\nmaximum number of iterations set to 100[25, 26]. The LER of this code-decoder pair is\nshown in Fig. 1, where we see that the threshold is about 10.6-10.7%. Since the fidelity\nis one minus the depolarizing probability, this translates to an input fidelity threshold\nof about 89.3-89.4%. Also, even with n= 544, the LER is≈10−6at depolarizing rate\n10−2. Again, note that these curves can be interpreted as the performance of Bell pair\npurification when only Bob’s qubits are affected by errors.\n2.2 New Protocols to Purify GHZ States with QLDPC Codes\nProtocol I: Given these insights, we proceed to investigate the purification of GHZ states.\nAs in the Wilde et al.protocol, we consider only local operations and one-way classical\ncommunications (LOCC), and assume that these are noiseless. The key technical insight\nnecessary to construct the protocol is the GHZ-equivalent of the transpose property of\nBell pairs. Given ncopies of the GHZ state, whose three subsystems are marked ‘A’,\n‘B’ and ‘C’, we find that applying a matrix on qubits ‘A’ is equivalent to applying a\n“stretched” version of the matrix on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’ together (see Lemma 3). We call this\nmappingtothestretchedversionofthematrixthe GHZ-map , andprovethatitisan algebra\nhomomorphism [27], i.e., linear, multiplicative, and hence projector-preserving. Recollect\nfrom the Bell pair purification setting that we are interested in measuring stabilizers on\nqubits ‘A’ and understanding their effect on the remaining qubits. Using the properties of\nthe GHZ-map, we show that it suffices to consider only the simple case of a single stabilizer.\nWith this great simplification, we prove that imposing a given [ [n,k,d ] ]stabilizer code on\nqubits ‘A’ simultaneously imposes a certain [ [2n,k,d′] ]stabilizer code jointly on qubits ‘B’\nand ‘C’. By performing diagonal Clifford operations on qubits ‘C’, which commutes with\nany operations on t\n’. By performing diagonal Clifford operations on qubits ‘C’, which commutes with\nany operations on the other qubits, one can vary the distance d′of the induced ‘BC’ code.\nThen, we use this core technical result to devise a natural protocol that purifies GHZ states\nusing any stabilizer code (“Protocol I”, see Fig. 2 and Algorithm 2).\nWe perform simulations on the [ [5,1,3] ]perfect code and compare the protocol failure\nrate to the LER of the code on the depolarizing channel, both using a maximum-likelihood\ndecoder. In terms of error exponents, we show that it is always better for Bob to perform\na local diagonal Clifford operation on Charlie’s qubits, rather than Alice doing the same.\nWe support the empirical observation with an analytical argument on the induced BC code\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

Alice generates ncopies of the ideal 3-qubit GHZ state and marks one qubit of each triple as\n‘A’, another as ‘B’, and the third as ‘C’. She measures the stabilizers of the code on the nqubits marked ‘A’ and classically communicates the results through a\nnoiseless channel to Bob. She also sends all the remaining 2nqubits to him. First, Bob uses the “GHZ-map” to measure stabilizers of the 2n-qubit code induced\nby Alice’s code and uses the results to correct errors on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’. Second, if the code is not CSS, then he performs a suitable diagonal Clifford UCon\nqubits ‘C’. Thirdly, he measures the stabilizers of Alice’s n-qubit code on qubits ‘B’ in order to impose the same code on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’. Lastly, he communicates\nthe results to Charlie over a noiseless channel and also sends qubits ‘C’ to him. Charlie measures the stabilizers of Alice’s code to detect and correct errors on\nqubits ‘C’. Finally, all thre\nasures the stabilizers of Alice’s code to detect and correct errors on\nqubits ‘C’. Finally, all three parties invert the encoding to convert the logical GHZ states to physical GHZ states. The scheme is suited for a linear network of three\nparties, but notice the asymmetrically larger burden on Bob, which makes the protocol less scalable to larger GHZ states.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 6and Charlie’s code. Finally, we finish by showing that the average output k-qubit density\nmatrix of the protocol is diagonal in the GHZ-basis, and its fidelity is directly dictated\nby the protocol’s failure rate. While the scheme is suited for a linear network of three\nparties, it is obvious that there is an asymmetrically larger burden on Bob, which makes\nthe protocol less scalable to larger GHZ states. Nevertheless, we think that this protocol\nstill has pedagogical value in understanding the implications of the new insight on GHZ\nstates.\nProtocol II: Motivated by this drawback, we devise an improved protocol that avoids\nthe additional 2n-qubit measurements of Protocol I. The new scheme is depicted in Fig. 3\nand described in Algorithm 4 for CSS codes. The protocol can be extended to general\nstabilizer codes through additional diagonal Clifford operations as in Protocol I but, for\nsimplicity, we focus on CSS (QLDPC) codes here. It will also be interesting to investigate\nif there are any potential gains from employing non-CSS stabilizer codes in entanglement\npurification, becauseCSScodesareknowntobeoptimalforcertainaspectsoffault-tolerant\nquantum computing [28]. When Alice measures stabilizers on qubits ‘A’, the new GHZ\nproperty still implies that there is a 2n-qubit code automatically induced on qubits ‘B’ and\n‘C’ together. In order to split that code into individual codes on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’, Alice\nperforms a second round of the same ( n-qubit) stabilizer measurements but this time on\nqubits ‘B’. This enables Bob and Charlie to \name ( n-qubit) stabilizer measurements but this time on\nqubits ‘B’. This enables Bob and Charlie to measure the same stabilizers on their respective\nqubits and correct errors induced by the channel on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’, respectively. The\nflowoftheprotocolisnaturallyapplicablewhenAliceisconnectedtobothBobandCharlie\nbut those two parties are not connected directly. But we emphasize that the protocol is\nscalable and we summarize its extension to larger GHZ states with larger number of parties\nconnected by any network topology; the key requirement is that the qubits of a recipient\nover a network edge have already been measured and projected to the code subspace before\nthose qubits are sent over the edge.\nIn Fig. 4 we report simulation results for Protocol II on 3-qubit GHZ states using\nthe same LP118 code family and MSA decoder as in Fig. 1. All data points except the\nfirst one on each curve (for depolarizing rate 0.09) were computed by collecting close to\n104logical errors. We observe that the threshold ( ≈10.7%) is very close to the single\ndecoder case in Fig. 1, which is reassuring since the GHZ protocol needs both Bob and\nCharlie to run decoders. In terms of fidelity, unlike the Bell pair case, twoqubits of each\nGHZ state (i.e., those marked ‘B’ and ‘C’) undergo depolarizing noise, so the input fidelity\nthreshold is (1−p)2≈0.7974wherep≈10.7%. Note that this is for a yield of 0.118,\nwhich is the asymptotic rate of the LP118 QLDPC code family. Technically, one must\nmultiply the code rate with one minus the protocol failure rate to get the exact yield, but\nwe assume that in practice we operate well away from the threshold where failure rates are\norders of magnitude smaller (see Fig. 1 for reference). However, the logical error rates are\nsignificantly higher than those in Fig. 1. This is likely due to the fact that both decoders\nmust succeed for the protocol to not fail. Note that there can be situations where an error\non Alice’s qubit cancels the errors on Bob’s and C\n Note that there can be situations where an error\non Alice’s qubit cancels the errors on Bob’s and Charlie’s due to the new GHZ property.\nBut it is unclear whether these have a significant effect on the protocol performance. We\nplan to study this carefully in future work because it is undesirable for failure rates to\nincrease as we scale the protocol to larger number of parties.\nTheimplementationofourprotocolisavailableonGitHubandarchivedonZenodo[29].\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 92.3 Discussion and Connections to Existing GHZ Purification Protocols\nWe are interested in comparing our protocols to past work on GHZ purification to judge\nthe effectiveness of our work. However, based on our knowledge of the literature and the\ndifferences in the settings of purification protocols, this appears to be challenging and\nis likely a work on its own. Nevertheless, let us address this in some detail here. In the\nprocess, we will make comparisons and show that our protocol has the best fidelity threshold\nfor3-GHZ purification at a yield of 0.118.\n1. Most protocols in the literature with numerical results perform heralded purification\nwhere both the protocol success probability and the output fidelity are not ideal. In\nour error correction based protocol, as long as the decoder succeeds in correcting the\nerror, we always obtain kperfect entangled states as the output (assuming perfect\nlocal operations and classical communication). It then seems natural to model this\nsetting as another probabilistic protocol, conditioned on the probability of successful\ndecoding, but with unit output fidelity, ignoring for now the additional fact that\nk≫1in our case whereas k= 1in most of the literature. However, this is not\nquite true since (iterative) decoder \nse whereas k= 1in most of the literature. However, this is not\nquite true since (iterative) decoder success does not come with a heralding signal.\nIn general, there are three possible scenarios: the decoder succeeds in correcting the\nerror, the decoder miscorrects the error (i.e., causes a logical error), or the decoder\nreaches the maximum number of iterations and returns a failure. In the first two\ncases, the decoder does find an estimated error pattern that matches the syndrome\nobtainedfromstabilizermeasurements, whereasinthelastcase, thedecoderisunable\nto even find an error pattern matching the syndrome. It is clear that this last case\nheralds a failure, but there is no way to distinguish the first two scenarios. Let us\nmention here that in the particular case of the Lifted Product family of codes that we\nconsider, most of the protocol failure events are due to the decoder declaring a failure\n(i.e., the third case above) and not due to miscorrections. However, this is only a\npreliminary observation that we are investigating in more detail. If we are able to\ndesign good codes for this iterative decoder where decoding success can be heralded,\nthen we can model the protocol similar to other existing non-error-correction-based\nprotocols. Currently, this is an important bottleneck that hinders making a fair and\nuseful comparison with existing protocols.\n2. Note that if the middle case (i.e., miscorrections) happens with non-negligible prob-\nability, then there are two ways to model the protocol: either the output fidelity is\nalways unity and the success probability is dictated by the decoding success rate, or\nthe protocol always succeeds whenever decoder doesn’t declare failure (i.e., the third\ncase) but the output fidelity is non-trivial and dictated by a mixed state account-\ning for all possible logical errors arising out of miscorrections. The former seems\nmore straightforward and especially appropriate if miscorrections hardly occur, but\nthis is another modeling d\nghtforward and especially appropriate if miscorrections hardly occur, but\nthis is another modeling decision that we must make when using error correction for\npurification.\nIt is interesting to note that Chau and Ho [30] have thought about the case of an\niterativedecodingfailureforquantumLDPCcodes. ThepaperisaboutpurifyingBell\npairs by concatenating recurrence with an outer QLDPC code rather than hashing,\nsince it is more practical. The authors use the final bitwise posterior probabilities of\nthe iterative decoder to find an appropriate unencoding circuit, at the end of which\nthey can throw away some Bell pairs with confidence that the decoding failure most\nlikely only affected them. They only provide one QLDPC code as an example, but\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 10the method seems quite computationally challenging because this must happen in\nruntime. Since they do not consider a code family, there is no relevant threshold for\ntheir protocol and their work is restricted to Bell pairs.\n3. Hashing was introduced by Bennett et al. in their seminal paper [13] and it has\nbecomethego-totoolforobtainingfiniteyield(i.e., ratioofnumberofpurifiedoutput\nstates to noisy input states) from a mixture of imperfect noisy entangled states. The\nthreshold input fidelity for purifying Werner (Bell) states through hashing is about\n0.8107. By first performing recurrence and then feeding the output into hashing\nbrings the threshold down to 0.5. However, recurrence needs two-way communication\nand has zero yield by itself, whereas hashing needs one-way communication but\ninfinite copies to produce finite yield. Since hashing effectively depends on random\ncodes, itisimpracticalbecausedecodingrandomlinearcodesisNP-complete[31,32].\n4. Nevertheless, hashing has been extended to multipartite states such as GHZ states,\nfirst by Maneva and Smolin [33]. They extract entropy from the bits representing the\nsigns of the different stabilizers of multipl\n]. They extract entropy from the bits representing the\nsigns of the different stabilizers of multiple copies of the multipartite entangled state.\nFor Werner-type 3-qubit GHZ states, their threshold is effectively about 0.8075. If we\nequate their yield to the rate of the Lifted Product quantum LDPC code family that\nwe use in our simulations, which is about 0.118asymptotically, then the threshold\nfidelity of the Maneva-Smolin protocol is 0.8401. In our setting, where each ‘B’\nand ‘C’ qubit of each GHZ state goes through an i.i.d. depolarizing noise channel,\nthe resulting state is diagonal in the GHZ basis but not exactly of Werner type.\nNevertheless, the fidelity for the noisy state is simply given by the probability that\nboth qubits are not affected by noise, i.e., (1−p)2ifpis the depolarizing rate.\nUsing this, our threshold of 10.7%for3-qubit GHZ purification maps to a fidelity\nthresholdofabout 0.7974, whichisveryencouraging. Notethatbothhashingandour\nprotocol assume ideal LOCC. In fact, the Maneva-Smolin protocol appears to need\nseveral rounds of hashing-style broadcast, whereas our protocol only needs one-way\ncommunication, devoid of randomness.\n5. In [34], Ho and Chau generalize the Maneva-Smolin protocol for multipartite entan-\nglement purification and produce three new protocols, based on concatenating inner\nrepetition codes with outer random hashing codes. For the case of three-qubit GHZ\nstates, their best protocol has a fidelity threshold of 0.7074(assuming an inner rep-\netition code of length 15). If we look at Figure 4 of this paper, which plots fidelity\nagainst yield for different size GHZ states for their best protocol, the curve for rep-\netition length 7(the maximum that they consider in the plot) produces a yield of\n0.118(the asymptotic rate of our QLDPC code family) only far above input fidelity\nof0.95. These are the best thresholds that we could find for purifying GHZ states. A\nrecent paper on GHZ purification [35] also uses the Maneva-Smolin protocol\nr purifying GHZ states. A\nrecent paper on GHZ purification [35] also uses the Maneva-Smolin protocol as their\nreference, so our judgment appears to be justified.\nIt is encouraging to see that the same authors, Ho and Chau, were the ones who\nshowed the use of a degenerate quantum (LDPC) code to purify Bell pairs as men-\ntioned in point 2) above. Besides, such hashing based methods are not resilient to\nnoise unless implemented in a measurement-based way [36], which itself needs prepa-\nrations of highly entangled cluster states. Therefore, our new protocol with good\nQLDPC codes serves as the state-of-the-art for purifying GHZ states.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 116. Most existing protocols based on recurrence or hashing or other related methods\ninvolve deep circuits that appear to require interactions between arbitrary pairs of\nqubits. This is extremely challenging in a fault-tolerant setting. However, when\nour protocol is used in conjunction with good quantum LDPC codes, the circuits\nare deterministic as they only involve stabilizer measurements, and stabilizers are\nlow-weight due to the LDPC property. Therefore, these are much more conducive to\nfault-tolerant entanglement purification in quantum networks.\n7. In recent protocols on purifying GHZ states, such as in [10], the setting is to use Bell\npairs that are purified and fused to form one GHZ state. The performance curves plot\ninput fidelity of each Bell pair versus output fidelity of the single purified GHZ state.\nWe think that our setting is quite different, once again because our output fidelity\nis ideal conditioned on decoder success, but also because we do not use Bell pairs as\ninputs. Even this particular work only compares their results with that of a single\npast work, which is that of Nickerson et al. [8] where they adopt a similar approach.\nOther works, such as [9], consider Bell pair purification using optimized protocols\nunderthepracticalsettingwhereth\nch as [9], consider Bell pair purification using optimized protocols\nunderthepracticalsettingwherethepurificationcircuitsareimperfectandnoisy. We\nemphasize that our error correction based approach potentially offers fault tolerance\nbut our current setting introduces noise only in the quantum communication channel\nand assumes perfect local operations. We leave the investigation of a fully fault-\ntolerant setting for our protocol to future work.\n2.4 Decoding QLDPC Codes under Realistic Noise Models\nWhile our main results are relevant to the “code capacity” error model, where there are\nonly qubit errors and all operations are assumed noiseless, in a separate work a subset of\nthe authors considered decoding this family of QLDPC codes under a “phenomenological”\nnoise model, i.e., with an additional (classical) error model on the syndromes [26]. In that\nsetting, motivated by practical situations, the syndromes extracted from a measurement\ncircuit are assumed to have an additional random Gaussian noise, thereby yielding “soft”\nsyndromes. It was shown then that the MSA decoder can be modified appropriately such\nthat the decoding performance is almost as good as the above ideal syndrome scenario.\nTherefore, by reinterpreting that work in the context of entanglement purification, we\nhighlight that the protocol can be applied to more realistic settings as well.\nSince we are constructing a new GHZ purification protocol based on this new insight\nabout GHZ states, we have considered this simple model of noiseless LOCC and noisy\nqubit communications. We emphasize here that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst protocol to use quantum error correction for purifying GHZ states, and we also report\nsimulation results of state-of-the-art QLDPC codes with an efficient iterative decoder.\nMoreover, bycomparisontopastworks, wehaveshownthatourschemehasthebestfidelity\nthreshold of 0.7974for i.i.d. single-qubit depolarizing noise, at a yield of 0.118.

While the\nproblem of noisy local operations is important and has received attention [8, 9, 15, 37], we\nleave this to future work.\n2.5 Purification-Inspired Algorithm to Generate Logical Pauli Operators\nIn the process, inspired by stabilizer measurements on Bell/GHZ states, we have developed\na new algorithm to generate logical Pauli operators for any stabilizer code (see Algorithm 3\nand its explanation in Appendix D.2). The core idea is to first simulate the generation on\nnBell/GHZ states by creating a table of their 2nstabilizers. It turns out that we only\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 12need theZZI- andXXX-type stabilizers for the GHZ case, which is why we ignore the n\nIZZ-type stabilizers. Then we simulate the measurement of each code stabilizer on qubits\n‘A’ using the stabilizer formalism. At the end of this process, it can be shown that the\nnon-code-stabilizer rows in the table must be a combination of logical Pauli operators on\nmultiple subsystems. Finally, we carefully identify the logical Pauli operators on qubits\n‘A’ and return those as the desired operators on the given code.\n3 Notation and Background\nThe Pauli group on nqubits is denoted by Pn. We denote Pauli matrices I,X,Y,Z and\ntheir tensor products using the notation E(a,b), wherea,b∈{0,1}ndenote respectively\ntheX- andZ-components of the n-qubit Pauli operator. The weightof a Pauli operator\nis the number of qubits on which it acts nontrivially (i.e., does not apply I). For example,\nE([0,1,0,1],[0,0,1,1]) =I⊗X⊗Z⊗Y≡IXZYhas weight 3and we dropped the\ntensor product symbol ⊗for brevity. Two Pauli operators E(a,b),E(c,d)either commute\nor anticommute, and this is dictated by the symplectic inner product in the binary vector\nspace. If⟨[a,b],[c,d]⟩s:=adT+bcT= 0(resp. 1) (mod 2), then they commute (resp.\nanticommute).\nAstabilizergroup SisgeneratedbycommutingPaulioperators εiE(ai,bi),i= 1,2,..\nute (resp.\nanticommute).\nAstabilizergroup SisgeneratedbycommutingPaulioperators εiE(ai,bi),i= 1,2,...,r,\nwhereεi∈{± 1}and−I2n/∈S. The [ [n,k,d ] ]stabilizer code defined by Sis given by\nQ(S) ={|ψ⟩∈C2n:g|ψ⟩=|ψ⟩∀g∈S}, wherek=n−r. The logical Pauli operators of\nthe code commute with all stabilizers but do not belong to S, and their minimum weight\nisd. The code is completely defined by its stabilizers and logical operators, or equiva-\nlently by an encoding circuit UEnc(S). The projector onto the code subspace is given by\nΠS=/producttextr\ni=11\n2[I2n+εiE(ai,bi)].\nA CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code is a special type of stabilizer code for which\nthere exists a set of stabilizer generators such that each generator is purely X-type, i.e., of\nthe formE(ai,0), or purelyZ-type, i.e., of the form E(0,bj). Such a code can be described\nby a pair of classical binary linear codes CXandCZ, where the rows of the parity-check\nmatrixHX(resp.HZ) forCX(resp.CZ) areai∈{0,1}n(resp.bj∈{0,1}n). Since\nE(ai,0)andE(0,bj)must commute, the symplectic inner product constraint leads to the\nconditionaibT\nj= 0for alli,jor, equivalently, HXHT\nZ= 0.\nA quantum (CSS) low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code is described by a pair\n(CX,CZ)of classical LDPC codes, which implies that HXandHZare sparse, i.e., each\nstabilizer involves few qubits and each qubit is involved in few stabilizers. It is very chal-\nlenging to construct good QLDPC codes due to the constraint HXHT\nZ= 0on two sparse\nmatrices, but recent exciting work has developed optimal QLDPC codes where kandd\nscale linearly with n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. For our simulations, we chose a specific family of\nlifted product QLDPC codes from [25, Table II] that have asymptotic rate k/n= 0.118.\nTo decode these codes, we use the computationally efficient min-sum algorithm (MSA)\nbased iterative decoder under the sequential schedule [38, 39], with a normalization factor\nof0.8and maximum number of iterations set to 100(also see the description in [25]).\nA stabilizer sta\nof0.8and maximum number of iterations set to 100(also see the description in [25]).\nA stabilizer state corresponds to a code with dimension k= 0, and can equivalently be\nrepresented by a maximal stabilizer group, i.e., with r=n. Any Pauli measurement on\nthe state can be simulated by a well-defined set of rules to update this stabilizer group.\nThese rules are given by the stabilizer formalism for measurements [23, 40].\nFor any matrix M, the Bell state|Φ⟩AB=|00⟩AB+|11⟩AB√\n2satisfies the property (MA⊗\nIB)|Φ⟩AB= (IA⊗MT\nB)|Φ⟩AB. This property extends to ncopies of the Bell state as\nwell. When Mis a projector, which is the case when we perform stabilizer measurements\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

Therefore, imposing a code on qubits ‘A’ simultaneously imposes the “transpose”\ncode on qubits ‘B’.\nA more detailed discussion of these background concepts can be found in Appendix A.\n4 Revisiting the Bell Pair Distillation Protocol\nInRef.[18], Wilde et al.describedaprotocoltodistillBellpairsusinganarbitraryquantum\nstabilizer code. We reiterate this protocol here and provide more clarity on the reasons\nbehind its working. Then, in the next section, we will generalize this protocol to distill\nGHZ states, i.e., the ℓ-qubit entangled state/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleGHZℓ/angbracketrightig\n=1√\n2(|00···0⟩+|11···1⟩).\nInitially, Alicegenerates ncopiesoftheBellstate/vextendsingle/vextendsingleΦ+/angbracketrightbig(n“ebits”), rearrangesthequbits\nas described above, and sends Bob’s set of nqubits to him over a noisy channel. It is not\nnecessary th\n described above, and sends Bob’s set of nqubits to him over a noisy channel. It is not\nnecessary that Alice must prepare Bell pairs locally and then transmit half the qubits to\nBob. Indeed, the protocol is applicable as long as Alice and Bob share some initial (noisy)\nBell pairs. Then, Alice measures the stabilizers of a quantum stabilizer code defined by\nS=⟨εiE(ai,bi);i= 1,...,r⟩on her qubits, with εi=±1. Let her measurement results\nbe(−1)mi,mi∈{0,1}. This projects her qubits onto the codespace fixed by the stabilizers\nS′=⟨(−1)miεiE(ai,bi);i= 1,...,r⟩. Alice applies some suitable Pauli “correction” to\nbring her qubits back to the code subspace Q(S)(rather thanQ(S′)), if that is the code she\ndesires to use. She classically communicates the chosen stabilizers, S, the measurements\n{mi}r\ni=1, and the Pauli correction to Bob.\nAlthoughweusetheterm“correction”, thereisreallynoerroronAlice’squbits. Instead,\nthe terminology is used to indicate that Alice brings the qubits to her desired code space.\nFurthermore, even if there is some error on Alice’s qubits, one can map it to an equivalent\nerror on Bob’s qubits using the Bell state matrix identity.\nNote that the authors of Ref. [18] do not explicitly mention that the Pauli correction\nneeds to be communicated, but it could be necessary in situations where Alice’s and Bob’s\ndecoders are not identical or have some randomness embedded in them.

Now, Bob measures the stabilizers εiE(ai,bi)and applies corrections on his\nqubits using his syndromes as well as Alice’s syndromes (and the Bell matrix identity,\nwhich in particular involves the transpose). This projects his qubits to the same codespace\nas Alice. Finally, Alice and Bob locally apply the inverse of the encoding unitary for their\ncode,UEnc(S)†. If Bob’s correction was successful, this converts the klogical Bell pairs\nintokphysical Bell pairs that are, on average, of higher quality than the nnoisy Bell\npairs initially shared between them. This protocol is shown in Figure 5 and summarized\nin Algorithm 1.\nWhile the steps of the protocol are clear, it is worth considering why the logical qubits\nof Alice and Bob must be kcopies of the Bell pair, assuming all errors were corrected\nsuccessfully. To get some intuition, let us quickly consider the example of the 3-qubit\nbit-flip code defined by S=⟨ZZI,IZZ⟩. According to (58), the projector onto Q(S)is\nΠS=(I8+ZZI)\n2(I8+IZZ)\n2. The encoding unitary, as described in Appendix A.2, is UEnc=\nCNOT 1→2CNOT 1→3. SinceZT=Z, Alice’s measurements will project Bob’s qubits onto\nthe same code subspace as her’s. For convenience, assume that Alice obtains the trivial\nsyndrome (+1,+1)and that the channel does not introduce any error.

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 18and replace all other anticommuting elements by their product with ZA4ZB4. Let\nthis updated group in Step (1) of Table 1\nr anticommuting elements by their product with ZA4ZB4. Let\nthis updated group in Step (1) of Table 1 be denoted as E(1)\n5. For visual clarity, code\nstabilizer rows are boldfaced and binary vectors are written out in full.\nNow, we observe that if Bob measures the same generator XB1ZB2ZB3XB4on his\nqubits, then it is trivial because it commutes with all elements in E(1)\n5and hence is\nalready contained in E(1)\n5. This is a manifestation of the Bell state matrix identity\ndiscussed in Section A.4. Indeed, Bob’s generator can be obtained by multiplying\nXA1XB1,XA4XB4,ZA2ZB2,ZA3ZB3,andXA1ZA2ZA3XA4in Step (1) of Table 1.\n(2) Alice measures the second stabilizer generator XA2ZA3ZA4XA5, and assume that the\nmeasurement result is ε2∈{± 1}. Then, the new joint stabilizer group, E(2)\n5, is given\nin Step (2) of Table 1. This stabilizer generator anticommutes with the third row of\nthe top block and the second and fifth rows of the bottom block. We have replaced\nZA5ZB5(fifth row of the bottom block) with this generator and multiplied the other\nanticommuting elements with ZA5ZB5. It can be verified that the second stabilizer\ngenerator of Bob is already in E(2)\n5.\n(3) Alice measures the third stabilizer generator XA1XA3ZA4ZA5, and assume that the\nmeasurement result is ε3∈{± 1}. Then, the new joint stabilizer group, E(3)\n5, is given\nin Step (3) of Table 1. Once again, it can be verified that the third stabilizer genera-\ntor of Bob is already in E(3)\n5. The minus sign in the fourth row of the top block gets\nintroduced when we apply the multiplication rule for E(a,b)from Lemma 9(b).\n(4) Alice measures the final stabilizer generator ZA1XA2XA4ZA5, and assume that the\nmeasurement result is ε4∈{± 1}. Then, the new joint stabilizer group, E(4)\n5, is given\nin Step (4) of Table 1. As before, it can be verified that the final stabilizer generator\nof Bob is already in E(4)\n5. This completes all measurements of Alice, and she now\nsends Bob’s qubits over the channel. To understand the working of the \nrements of Alice, and she now\nsends Bob’s qubits over the channel. To understand the working of the protocol in\nthe ideal scenario, assume that no errors occur.\nSince we know that all stabilizer generators of Bob are in E(4)\n5, we conveniently perform\nthe following replacements:\nE([eA\n1,eB\n1],[(e2+e5)A,(e2+e5)B])∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→XB1ZB2ZB3XB4,\nE([(e1+e2)A,(e1+e2)B],[eA\n4,eB\n4])∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→XB2ZB3ZB4XB5,\nE([(e1+e3)A,(e1+e3)B],[(e4+e5)A,(e4+e5)B])∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→XB1XB3ZB4ZB5,\nE([eA\n5,eB\n5],[(e1+e4)A,(e1+e4)B])∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→ZB1XB2XB4ZB5.(11)\nRecollect that for the [ [5,1,3] ]code, the logical Pauli operators are X=X1X2X3X4X5=\nE([11111,00000])andZ=Z1Z2Z3Z4Z5=E([00000,11111]). If we used Algorithm 3, we\nwith the measured stabilizer.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 19would obtain the same ZandX=−Y1Z3Z4. Then, by grouping Alice’s code stabilizers\nand Bob’s code stabilizers, the group E(4)\n5can be rewritten as\nE(4)\n5=⟨ε1XA1ZA2ZA3XA4, ε2XA2ZA3ZA4XA5, ε3XA1XA3ZA4ZA5, ε4ZA1XA2XA4ZA5,\nE([(e1+e5)A,(e1+e5)B],[eA\n3,eB\n3]),−E([(e1+e4+e5)A,(e1+e4+e5)B],[eA\n5,eB\n5]),\nε1XB1ZB2ZB3XB4, ε2XB2ZB3ZB4XB5, ε3XB1XB3ZB4ZB5, ε4ZB1XB2XB4ZB5⟩.(12)\nUsing some manipulations, we see that the two operators on the second line in E(4)\n5are\nE([(e1+e5)A,(e1+e5)B],[eA\n3,eB\n3]) = (XA1ZA3XA5)(XB1ZB3XB5)≡ZAZB,\n−E([(e1+e4+e5)A,(e1+e4+e5)B],[eA\n5,eB\n5]) = (ıXA1XA4YA5)(ıXB1XB4YB5)≡XAXB.\n(13)\nThus,E(4)\n5can be interpreted as having 8stabilizer generators (Alice and Bob combined)\nand a pair of logical XAXBand logical ZAZBoperators, which implies that the pair of\nlogical qubits shared between Alice and Bob forms a Bell pair. This can be converted into\na physical Bell pair by performing the inverse of the encoding unitary on both Alice’s and\nBob’s qubits locally. Note that this encoding unitary must be compatible with the above\ndefinition of the logical Paulis for the [ [5,1,3] ]code, i.e., when the physical XandZon\nthe input (logical) qubit to the encoder is conjugated by the chosen encoding un\nhe physical XandZon\nthe input (logical) qubit to the encoder is conjugated by the chosen encoding unitary, the\nresult must be the above logical Paulis XandZ, respectively, potentially multiplied by\nsome stabilizer element.\nRemark 2. In this example, we have assumed that Bob’s qubits do not suffer any error,\nso that we can clearly show the existence of the correct logical Bell stabilizers. If, however,\nthe channel introduced an error, then Alice and Bob can jointlydeduce the error by\nmeasuring the signs of all generators of E(1)\n5and applying the necessary Pauli correction.\nSince there are no non-trivial logical Pauli operators, any syndrome-matched correction\ncan differ from the true error only by a stabilizer, so any error is correctable by the joint\naction of Alice and Bob. But, since we prohibit non-local measurements between Alice\nand Bob, our error correction capability is limited to that of the code (on Bob’s side). If the\nchannel introduces a correctable Pauli error for the chosen code and Bob’s decoder, then\nthe protocol will output kperfect Bell pairs. However, if the Pauli error is miscorrected\nby Bob’s decoder, then there will be a logical error on the code, and hence at least one of\nthekoutput Bell pairs will suffer from an unknown Pauli error.\nWe can arrive at the above conclusion without knowing the specific logical operators for\nthe code. After Alice measures all her stabilizer generators, we know that Bob’s stabilizer\ngenerators will also be present in the group, simply based on the Bell state matrix identity\nfromSectionA.4. Forthisexample, thetransposeinthatidentitydidnotmakeadifference,\nbut for other codes this can only introduce an additional minus sign since YT=−Y. For\nan[ [n,k,d ] ]code, we now have a 2n-qubit stabilizer group E(n−k)\nnwhere 2(n−k)generating\nelements are Alice’s and Bob’s stabilizer generators. We are left with 2n−2(n−k) = 2k\nelements in the generators, each of which mustjointly involve Alice’s andBob’s qubits.\nThese commute with\nnts in the generators, each of which mustjointly involve Alice’s andBob’s qubits.\nThese commute with each other and with the 2(n−k)stabilizer generators of Alice and\nBob, and are independent, so we can rename them as the logical XAjXBjand logical\nZAjZBjforj= 1,2,...,k. Thus,by definition , thekpairs of logical qubits form klogical\nBell pairs. Alice and Bob can produce physical Bell pairs by simultaneously inverting the\n(same) encoding unitary for the code locally. This is the key idea behind the working of\nthe Bell pair distillation protocol employed by Wilde et al.in [18].\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 205 Distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) States\nIn this section, we extend the above Bell pair distillation protocol to distill GHZ states,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleGHZℓ/angbracketrightig\n=(|00···0⟩+|11···1⟩)√\n2. For clarity, we will specifically discuss the standard case of\nℓ= 3, but the results and analysis extend to larger ℓas well. Let nGHZ states be shared\nbetween Alice, Bob, and Charlie. We rearrange all the qubits to keep Alice’s, Bob’s and\nCharlie’s qubits together respectively. Hence, this joint state can be expressed as\n|GHZn⟩ABC=/parenleftbigg|000⟩ABC+|111⟩ABC√\n2/parenrightbigg⊗n\n=1√\n2n/summationdisplay\nx∈Fn\n2|x⟩A|x⟩B|x⟩C.(14)\nSincetheGHZstatehasstabilizers SGHZ=⟨ZAZBIC, IAZBZC, XAXBXC⟩, thestabilizers\nfor|GHZn⟩ABCare\nS⊗n\nGHZ=⟨ZAiZBiICi, IAiZBiZCi, XAiXBiXCi;i= 1,2,...,n⟩. (15)\nThus, we have identified the GHZ version of the basic properties of Bell states that was\nneeded in the Bell pair distillation protocol. However, the critical part of the Wilde et\nal.protocol was the transpose trick that formed the Bell matrix identity in Appendix A.4.\nWhen applied to stabilizer codes, this implied that each stabilizer generator εE(a,b)of\nAlice is transformed into the generator εE(a,b)T=ε(−1)abTE(a,b)(using Lemma 9(a))\nforBob.

The above properties greatly simplify the analysis,\ngiven that the code projector for a stabilizer code (58)is a product of sums. Due to\nthe multiplicativity of the GHZ-map M∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→/hatwiderM, we only have to analyze the case where\nAlice’s code has a single stabilizer generator εE(a,b), i.e., her code projector is simply\nM=IN+εE(a,b)\n2, whereN= 2n.

Considern= 1and the case when Alice applies M=I+Z\n2=I+E(0,1)\n2, with\na= 0,b= 1. Then/hatwideI=I⊗I+Z⊗Z\n2and\\E(0,1)T= (E(0,1)T⊗E(0,0))·/hatwideI= (Z⊗I)·/hatwideI.\nTherefore, the stabilizers for BC are ⟨Z⊗I,Z⊗Z⟩.\nIf we had an X-measurement for Alice, where a= 1,b= 0, thenE(a,b)T⊗E(a,0) =\nX⊗X. Combined with the Z⊗Zfrom/hatwideI, the qubits on BC are projected to the Bell\nstate.\nMore interestingly, if we consider a Y-measurement for Alice, where a=b= 1, then\nE(a,b)T⊗E(a,0) =YT⊗X=−Y⊗X. Thus, assuming the measurement result is +1,\nthe new BC stabilizers are ⟨−Y⊗X,Z⊗Z⟩. It can be verified that the post-measurement\nstate for this case will be(|0⟩+ı|1⟩)√\n2⊗(|00⟩−ı|11⟩)√\n2, which is fixed by the above stabilizer.\nNaturally, this insight can be generalized to larger GHZ states as well.\nTheorem 7.

All the GHZ\nstabilizers involving subsystems A 2,A3,...,Aℓare retained. Hence, the post-measurement\nstate is “GHZ-like” on these (ℓ−1)subsystems but with an additional globally entangling\nstabilizer. This is akin to the globally entangling all- Xstabilizer for the standard GHZ\nstate, but it depends on the Pauli operator being measured on A 1. Note that, since the\nPauli measurement randomly projects onto a subspace, the induced stabilizers given by the\ntheorem do not uniquely determine the post-measurement state on the (ℓ−1)subsystems.\nThedegreesoffreedomforthestatewillbequantifiedshortlyinamoregeneralsetting. One\nmightarguethatthistheoremcanbeobtainedbydirectl\natewillbequantifiedshortlyinamoregeneralsetting. One\nmightarguethatthistheoremcanbeobtainedbydirectlyapplyingthestabilizerformalism\ntoSGHZ. However, some thought clarifies that arriving at the conclusions rigorously takes\nat least an equal amount of effort.\nIn the context of measuring a set of (n−k)stabilizer generators of a code (on qubits\nA1), the above result confirms that this induces a joint stabilizer code on the remaining\n(ℓ−1)subsystems. There are n(ℓ−1)qubits on these subsystems and each code stabi-\nlizer generator contributes a stabilizer generator for this induced code. Besides, as stated\nin the theorem, there are n(ℓ−2)GHZ stabilizers on all pairs of adjacent subsystems,\n{AjAj+1;j= 2,...,ℓ−1}, independent of the code stabilizers being measured. Hence,\ntheinducedcodehas (n−k)+n(ℓ−2)stabilizergenerators, whichmeansitisan [ [n(ℓ−1),k] ]\ncode and the post-measurement state has klogical degrees of freedom. The minimum dis-\ntance of the induced code will depend on the minimum distance of the A 1-code as well as\nthe new GHZ stabilizers and the choice of {bi}.\n5.2 Protocol I\nWe now have all the tools to investigate a natural stabilizer code based GHZ distillation\nprotocol that attempts to generalize the Bell pair distillation protocol discussed in Sec-\ntion 4. The block diagram of this protocol was shown earlier in Fig. 2 and the protocol is\nsummarized as an algorithm in Algorithm 2. Let us consider the 3-qubit code with sta-\nbilizersS=⟨YYI,IYY⟩to understand the subtleties in the steps of the protocol. First,\nsimilar to the Bell pair scenario, we have the following stabilizer group for 3copies of the\nGHZ state:\nG3=⟨ZAiZBiICi, IAiZBiZCi, XAiXBiXCi;i= 1,2,3⟩ (47)\n=⟨E([0A,0B,0C],[eA\ni,eB\ni,0C]), E([0A,0B,0C],[0A,eB\ni,eC\ni]),\nE([eA\ni,eB\ni,eC\ni],[0A,0B,0C]) ;i= 1,2,3⟩(48)\n=⟨E([0A,0B,0C],[eA\ni,eB\ni,0C]), E([0A,0B,0C],[0A,eB\ni,eC\ni]),\n−E([eA\ni,eB\ni,eC\ni],[eA\ni,eB\ni,0C]) ;i= 1,2,3⟩(49)\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

(50)\nNext, like the example for the Bell pair distillation protocol, we can evolve these stabilizers\nthrough the proposed steps of the protocol to understand its working. In Appendix C, we\nuse such a tabular approach to elucidate the steps of this protocol. This serves as an\ninstructive example to understand how the GHZ property influences the construction of\na purification protocol for GHZ states. In particular, since the property implies that the\nZ-component of any non-purely- X-type stabilizer is lost in the induced code on qubits ‘B’\nand ‘C’, we discuss how one can perform diagonal Clifford operations to ensure that all\nthree subsystems obtain the same code. The placement of these operations is critical and\nwe detail its effects by simulating the protocol performance for the 5-qubit code.\nIn this protocol, Alice starts by preparing nGHZ states and measuring the n-qubit\nstabilizers of her code on qubits ‘A’. Then, using Theorem 6, Bob proceeds by measuring\nthe2n-qubit stabilizers of the code induced on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’ by Alice’s choice of code\non qubits ‘A’. Subsequently, he also measures the same n-qubit stabilizers as Alice but\non qubits ‘B’, so that there is a code induced just on qubits ‘C’ and Charlie can use that\ncode to correct errors from the channel. If we imagine the three parties being on a linear\nnetwork topology, then this protocol seems reasonable since each party retains his/her\nqubits and passes on all remaining qubits to the next hop in the chain. However, there is\nan asymmetry in the operations since Bob needs to perform two rounds of measurements\nand one involves twice the number of qubits. Furthermore, the protocol is (potentially)\nnot scalable to larger number of parties with varied network topologies.\n5.3 Distillation-Inspired Algorithm to Generate Logical Pauli Operators\nWhile constructing and ana\n.\n5.3 Distillation-Inspired Algorithm to Generate Logical Pauli Operators\nWhile constructing and analyzing the protocol using the tabular approach, we realized\nthat the evolution of the table under stabilizer measurements automatically reveals the\nlogical Pauli operators of the code in an explicit manner in certain rows. Indeed, each\nstabilizer measurement replaces one row and alters several others that anticommute with\nit using the rules of the stabilizer formalism for measurements (Section A.3). After all\nstabilizers are measured on qubits ‘A’, one realizes that the non-replaced (but altered)\nrows in the top section of the table, i.e., the ZZI-type rows, are of the form ZA\niZB\niIC\ni\nwhereZidenotes the logical Zoperator on the i-th logical qubit of the code. Therefore,\none can easily read off these logical operators (up to some subtleties that can be taken\ncare of). A similar approach is applied to the bottom section of the table, i.e., the XXX-\ntype rows, to obtain the logical Xoperators of the code. The details of the algorithm are\ndiscussed in Appendix D.2 and the algorithm itself is summarized in Algorithm 3.\n5.4 Output Fidelity of GHZ Distillation Protocol\nDuring the protocol, if error correction at Bob and/or Charlie miscorrects and introduces\na logical error, then the final effect is a change in the signs of some of the logical GHZ\nstabilizers. This in turn means that after the decoding step, some of the ktriples will be\nthe standard GHZ state corrupted by an unknown Pauli operation. Hence, the output of\nthe protocol is correct with probability (1−Pf), and produces at least one Pauli corrupted\nGHZ state with probability Pf, using the notation in Fig. 6. To make this precise, denote\nby|GHZ 0⟩,|GHZ 1⟩,...,|GHZ 7⟩the eight possible variants of the GHZ state under Pauli\noperations, i.e., each variant has the stabilizer group ⟨α1ZZI, α 2IZZ, α 3XXX⟩with\nα1,α2,α3∈{± 1}. Then, assuming all variants are equally likely conditioned on a failure\nAccepted in Quantum2024\n 1}.

In Ref. [41],\nthe authors adopted exactly such a strategy for distillation of T-states, under a purely\nZ-error model and relying on post-selection where non-trivial syndromes are discarded.\nIn recent work [42], it has been shown that performing error correction rather than just\ndetection (and post-selection) leads to better performance of triorthogonal codes. For our\nscenario of GHZ distillation, it is an interesting problem to construct codes and decoders\nfor this protocol where we can relate the output fidelity to code properties and arrive at\nanalytical scaling arguments with increasing code size. This would be useful for comparing\nwith fundamental limits of entanglement distillation [17] and assessing the optimality of\nthis protocol.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 295.5 Protocol II\nTo address the drawbacks of Protocol I, the protocol can be modified so that Alice starts by\nmeasuring qubits ‘A’ and qubits ‘B’ separately. Though this does not circumvent the issue\nof performing twice the number of measurements at one of the nodes, this avoids the need\nof2n-qubit measurements. Since the GHZ property implies the inducement of a 2n-qubit\ncode on qubits ‘B’ and ‘C’, it appears that this extra round of n-qubit measurements on\nqubits ‘B’ is inevitable. So, even now, when Alice measures {εiE(ai,bi)}on qubits ‘A’,\nTheorem 6 still dictates that there is a 2n-qubit code{εiE(ai,bi)T\nB⊗E(ai,0)C}jointly on\nqubits ‘B’ and ‘C’. But, when she measures the same stabilizers {εiE(ai,bi)}on qubits ‘B’,\none can multiply with the corresponding 2n-qubit stabilizer to see that the joint stabilizers\ncan be broken into purely ‘B’ and purely ‘C’ stabilizers. Therefore, once Alice performs\nthe two \nrs\ncan be broken into purely ‘B’ and purely ‘C’ stabilizers. Therefore, once Alice performs\nthe two rounds of measurements, she can send qubits ‘B’ to Bob and qubits ‘C’ to Charlie,\nalong with the necessary classical information. As individual codes have been induced\nseparately on qubits ‘B’ and qubits ‘C’, Bob and Charlie can still perform local n-qubit\nmeasurements to fix errors during qubit transmission. Finally, this scheme suits other\nnetwork topologies such as when Alice is connected to both Bob and Charlie but those\nparties do not have a direct connection between them.\nWhile Protocol II can be generalized to arbitrary stabilizer codes using the diagonal\nClifford correction discussed in Protocol I, Algorithm 4 describes Protocol II specifically\nfor CSS codes, just for simplicity. Note that for CSS codes, for any stabilizer generator\nεiE(ai,bi), whenever ai̸= 0we havebi= 0. Hence, the induced code from Theorem 6 is\nautomatically CSS and we do not need any diagonal Clifford operation mentioned earlier\nin Protocol I. Since Protocol II relies on the same intuitions from Theorem 6, we do not\nelaboratefurther. Wealsonotethattherecanbefurthervariationsbasedonotherpractical\nconsiderations.\nThis simplified protocol was shown earlier in Fig. 3. We simulated the protocol by\nfollowing a tabular approach, as in Appendix C for Protocol I, using a state-of-the-art\nfamily of lifted product QLDPC codes with asymptotic rate 0.118and an efficient iterative\ndecoder based on the min-sum algorithm (MSA) with normalization factor 0.8. The results\nwere shown in Fig. 4, where we can see that the threshold under depolarizing noise is about\n10.7%. Comparing the results to Fig. 1, it is apparent that the threshold matches that\nof the underlying logical error rate of the code on this channel (i.e., no distillation but\nstandard quantum error correction simulation). This is important because it shows that\neven when both Bob and Charlie run decoders to correct errors on their respective qubi\nit shows that\neven when both Bob and Charlie run decoders to correct errors on their respective qubits,\nthe overall threshold is unchanged from the single channel setting. On the other hand,\nthe comparison also shows that the protocol failure rate is significantly worse for each\nchannel parameter compared to Fig. 1. This could be the effect of requiring both decoders\nto succeed, but it is a cause for concern when we extend the protocol to GHZ states with\nℓ\u003E3. Indeed, we do not want the protocol failure rates to progressively get worse, albeit\nwith the same threshold. Therefore, we will study this phenomenon more carefully in\nfuture work and identify the best way to scale this protocol for larger ℓ.

Groupthe nZAiZBiICiIDigeneratorsinthefirst\npart of the table, the n IAiZBiZCiIDigenerators in the second part, the n IAiIBiZCiZDi\nin the third part, and finally the nX AiXBiXCiXDiin the fourth part. If there is a purely\nZ-type generator, E(0,b)A, forS, then it will commute with the first three \nrt. If there is a purely\nZ-type generator, E(0,b)A, forS, then it will commute with the first three parts and only\naffect the last part based on the stabilizer formalism. Moreover, by an appropriate linear\ncombination of the rows of the first part, one can produce the element E(0,b)A⊗E(0,b)B,\nwhich when multiplied by the new code stabilizer produces the stabilizer E(0,b)Bon purely\nsubsystem ‘B’. By a similar trick in the second part and subsequently in the third part, one\ncan produce single-subsystem stabilizers E(0,b)CandE(0,b)Das well. Hence, it suffices\nto only consider non-purely- Z-type stabilizers E(a,b)A,a̸= 0.\nSuch stabilizers transform into the multiple-subsystem stabilizers described by Theo-\nrem 6. Now, qubits of ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’ need to be transmitted over a noisy channel to the\nrespective nodes, based on the network topology. For those nodes to be able to correct\nerrors, a code needs to be imposed purely on each subsystem beforetransmission of the\nrespective qubits. Let (node) A be connected to (node) B. Then, based on the choice of\nb1,b2,b3in Theorem 6, A measures code stabilizers E(a,b1)Bon qubits ‘B’. With some\nthought, one sees that these stabilizers only affect the second part of the table. Now, since\n±E(a,b1)B⊗E(a,b2)C⊗E(a,b3)Dis already a stabilizer, by multiplying with E(a,b1)B\nwe obtain a code on ‘B’ and a residual code jointly on ‘C’ and ‘D’. The qubits of ‘B’ can\nbe transmitted to node B (along with necessary classical sign information of stabilizers),\nwhich can perform error correction.\nIf A is not connected to C and D, then A has to send those qubits to B. Thus, it\nappears that A has to perform stabilizer measurements as above not only on ‘B’ but on\n‘C’ and ‘D’ as well. However, this can be relegated to subsequent nodes to reduce the\nburden on A. Let A also send qubits ‘C’ and ‘D’ to node B along with qubits ‘B’. There\nis some joint Pauli error on ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’, and the error correction of B only fixes the\nerror part on ‘B’. If B measu\nror on ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’, and the error correction of B only fixes the\nerror part on ‘B’. If B measures code stabilizers on ‘C’, then the preexisting Pauli error\ncan be transformed into an effective Pauli error afterthe code was imposed on ‘C’. This\nenables node C to correct this error as well as any error encountered while B sends qubits\n‘C’. A similar statement holds for D as well. Thus, the protocol can be stated as follows:\nfor every edge connected to a node, the node performs stabilizer measurements on the\nrespective subsystem to impose a code on the qubits of the recipient on that edge. The\ncorrectness of the protocol relies on carefully tracking signs of stabilizers based on such\nmeasurements at each node. Once all qubits are distributed, each node uses the logical\nPaulis of their respective codes to determine and invert the encoding unitary. This converts\ntheklogical GHZ states into kperfect physical GHZ states, provided all error corrections\nwere successful. The average output density matrix and average output fidelity still take\nthe form discussed in Section 5.4.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we began by describing the Bell pair distillation protocol introduced in\nRef. [18], and used the stabilizer formalism to understand its working. We identified\nthat the Bell state matrix identity (Appendix A.4) plays a critical role in that protocol.\nAs our first result, we proved the equivalent matrix identity for GHZ states, where we\nintroduced the GHZ-map and showed that it is an algebra homomorphism. Using the\nGHZ-map, we proved our main result (Theorem 6) that describes the effect of Alice’s\nstabilizer measurements (on qubits ‘A’) on qubits ‘B’ and qubits ‘C’. Then, we constructed\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

We demonstrated that the placement of a certain local Clifford on qubits ‘C’ in\nthe protocol has \nt. We demonstrated that the placement of a certain local Clifford on qubits ‘C’ in\nthe protocol has an immense effect on the performance of the protocol. We described\nthe relation between the probability of failure of the protocol and the output fidelity of\nthe GHZ states. As part of our protocol, we also developed a new algorithm to generate\nlogical Pauli operators for an arbitrary stabilizer code. To circumvent some drawbacks of\nthe protocol, we described an alternate protocol and produced performance results using\nstate-of-the-art QLDPC codes and an efficient iterative decoder. Finally, we discussed the\nscalability of the protocol for larger GHZ states involving more than 3parties and arbitrary\nnetwork topologies.\nIn future work, we plan to study the scaling of the logical error rate with the increase in\nnumberofparties. Sinceakeymotivationforthisworkwasdistributedquantumcomputing\n(DQC), we will investigate a complete architecture for a distributed implementation of the\nrecently proposed optimal families of QLDPC codes. As part of the architecture, we\nenvisage that the QLDPC-based GHZ purification scheme proposed in this paper will play\na critical role in supplying logical GHZ states encoded in the same QLDPC codes that are\nused for DQC. We will study the implications for fault-tolerance of such an architecture.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Kaushik Seshadreesan and Saikat Guha for helpful discus-\nsions, and Mark Wilde for describing his protocol to distill Bell pairs.

Here, |v⟩=|v1⟩⊗|v2⟩⊗···⊗|vn⟩\nis a standard basis vector for v= [v1,v2,...,vn], withvi∈F2={0,1}, and⊗denotes\nthe Kronecker (or tensor) product. Define ı:=√−1. Then, the well-known n-qubit Pauli\ngroupPnconsists of tensor products of the single-qubit Pauli matrices\nI=/bracketleftigg\n1 0\n0 1/bracketrightigg\n, X=/bracketleftigg\n0 1\n1 0/bracketrightigg\n, Z=/bracketleftigg\n1 0\n0−1/bracketrightigg\n, Y=ıXZ =/bracketleftigg\n0−ı\nı0/bracketrightigg\n, (52)\nmultiplied by scalars ıκ,κ∈{0,1,2,3}, i.e.,\nPn:={ıκE1⊗E2⊗···⊗En, Ei∈{I,X,Z,Y}, κ∈Z4={0,1,2,3}}.(53)\nGiven two binary row vectors a= [a1,a2,...,an],b= [b1,b2,...,bn]∈Fn\n2, we will write\nE(a,b)to denote an arbitrary Hermitian (and unitary) Pauli matrix, where arepresents\nthe “X-component” and brepresents the “ Z-component” [44]:\nE(a,b):=/parenleftig\nıa1b1Xa1Zb1/parenrightig\n⊗/parenleftig\nıa2b2Xa2Zb2/parenrightig\n⊗···⊗/parenleftig\nıanbnXanZbn/parenrightig\n=ıabTn/circlemultiplydisplay\ni=1(XaiZbi).\n(54)\nFor example, E([1,0,1],[0,1,1]) =X⊗Z⊗Y.

For details about extending the definition of E(a,b)to\nZ4-valued arguments, see [44].\nA.2 Stabilizer Codes and Encoding Unitaries\nA stabilizer group Sis a commutative subgroup of Pnthat does not contain −IN. If\nthe group has r≤nindependent generators εiE(ai,bi), whereεi∈ {± 1}, thenS=\n⟨εiE(ai,bi);i= 1,...,r⟩has size|S|= 2r. Since the generators are Hermitian and\nunitary, they have eigenvalues ±1. Recollect that commuting matrices can be diagonalized\nsimultaneously. The stabilizer code defined by Sis the common +1eigenspace of all\ngenerators, i.e., it is the 2k-dimensional subspace, k=n−r, fixed by all elements of S:\nQ(S):={|ψ⟩∈CN:g|ψ⟩=|ψ⟩∀g∈S}. (57)\nUsing the homomorphism γ, we can write a r×(2n+ 1)generator matrix GSfor\nthe stabilizer group: the ithrow ofGSis[ai,bi, εi]∈F2n\n2×{± 1}. SinceSmust be a\ncommutative group, the symplectic inner product between any pair of rows must be zero.\nHence, the subspace of binary mappings of all elements of S, denotedγ(S), is given by the\nrowspace of GS.\nA CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code is a specia\ns of S, denotedγ(S), is given by the\nrowspace of GS.\nA CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code is a special type of stabilizer code for which\nthere exists a set of generators where either bi= 0orai= 0in each generator, i.e., the\ngenerators are purely X-type and purely Z-type operators. Clearly, for such a code, GS\nhas a block diagonal form where we can express the X-type (resp. Z-type) operators as\nthe rowspace of a matrix [HX,0](resp. [0,HZ]), and 0represents the all-zeros matrix (of\nappropriate size). In this case, the commutativity condition for stabilizers is equivalent to\nthe condition HXHT\nZ= 0. Therefore, HXandHZcan be thought of as generating two\nclassical linear codes CXandCZ.\nThe projector onto the +1eigenspace of a Pauli matrix E(a,b)isIN+E(a,b)\n2. Therefore,\nsinceQ(S)is the simultaneous +1eigenspace of rcommuting matrices εiE(ai,bi), the\nprojector onto the code subspace Q(S)is\nΠS=r/productdisplay\ni=1(IN+εiE(ai,bi))\n2=1\n2r/summationdisplay\nm=[m1,...,mr]∈Fr\n2r/productdisplay\ni=1(εiE(ai,bi))mi=1\n2r/summationdisplay\nεE(a,b)∈SεE(a,b).\n(58)\nWhile the stabilizer group Sdefines the code space, an encoding unitary UEnc(S)fully\nspecifies the mapping from logical k-qubit states to physical n-qubit code states in Q(S).\nTheninput qubits toUEnc(S)can be split into klogical qubits, whose joint state is\narbitrary, and r=n−kancillary qubits, each of which is initialized in some specific state\nsuch as|0⟩. If ancillas are initialized in the |0⟩state, then the stabilizer group for these\nninput qubits is generated by {Zi;i=k+ 1,k+ 2,...,n}, sinceZ|0⟩=|0⟩. If we\nconjugate each of these rgenerators by the encoding unitary UEnc(S), then we will obtain\nrgeneratorsUEnc(S)ZiUEnc(S)†ofS. Similarly, if we conjugate the XiandZioperations\non theklogical qubits — which can be used to express arbitrary operations on them since\nPauli operators form a basis — by UEnc(S), then we will obtain the generators of logical\nXandZoperators compatible with the chosen UEnc(S). Therefore, an alternative me\nenerators of logical\nXandZoperators compatible with the chosen UEnc(S). Therefore, an alternative method\nto specifyUEnc(S)is to specify the generators of Sas well as the generators of logical X\nandZoperators. Since we are requiring UEnc(S)to map Paulis to Paulis, it is always\nClifford [23]. Note that UEnc(S)is still not unique since we are not specifying how Xion\nthe ancillas must be mapped, but we do not care about these additional mappings.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 38There are at least two algorithms provided in the literature for generating the logical\nPauli operators of stabilizer codes. One is by Gottesman [21, 45], where the idea is to\nconstruct the normalizer of the stabilizer group inside the Pauli group, and then perform\nsuitable row operations on the generators of the normalizer. The other is by Wilde [46],\nwhere he performs a symplectic Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to arrive at\nthe generators of logical Xand logical Zoperators. In this work, as part of our GHZ\ndistillation protocol, we provide a new algorithm to generate logical XandZoperators for\nany stabilizer code (see Algorithm 3). The output of the algorithm is compatible with the\nway logical Paulis must be defined for our analysis of the protocol. Additionally, the logical\nZoperators from our algorithm are always guaranteed to be purely Z-type operators for\nany stabilizer code. If the code is CSS, then the logical Xoperators are always purely\nX-type.\nA.3 Stabilizer Formalism\nWhen a stabilizer group on nqubits hasnindependent generators, Q(S)is a1-dimensional\nsubspace that corresponds to a unique quantum state |ψ(S)⟩(up to an irrelevant global\nphase), commonly referred to as a stabilizer state [21]. The actions of unitary operations\nandmeasurementson |ψ(S)⟩canbetrackedbyupdatingthese ngeneratorsaccordingly[23,\n40]. For any element gofS, and an arbitrary unitary operation Uon|ψ(S)⟩, we observe\nthat\nU|ψ(S)⟩=U·g·|ψ(S)⟩= (UgU†)·U|ψ(S)⟩, \n, and an arbitrary unitary operation Uon|ψ(S)⟩, we observe\nthat\nU|ψ(S)⟩=U·g·|ψ(S)⟩= (UgU†)·U|ψ(S)⟩, (59)\nso the stabilizer element ghas evolved into the element g′=UgU†after the action of U.\nOf course, only if Uis a Clifford operation we have that g′is also a Pauli matrix. Thus, in\nthis case the evolution of the state can be tracked efficiently by simply transforming GS\n(and the associated signs) through binary operations (see “CHP” algorithm [40]).\nThestabilizerformalismalsoprovidesamethodtosystematicallyupdatethestabilizers\nunder Pauli measurements of the state |ψ(S)⟩. Assume that we have ngenerators for the\nstabilizer group, namely εiE(ai,bi),i= 1,...,n, and that we are measuring the Pauli\noperatorµE(u,v)to obtain the measurement (−1)m,m∈ {0,1}. Then, we have the\nfollowing cases.\n1. If⟨[u,v],[ai,bi]⟩s= 0for alli, then either E(u,v)or−E(u,v)already belongs to S,\nso there is nothing to update.\n2. If⟨[u,v],[aj,bj]⟩s= 1for exactly one j∈{1,...,n}, then we replace εjE(aj,bj)by\n(−1)mµE(u,v).\n3. If⟨[u,v],[ai,bi]⟩s= 1fori∈I ⊆{ 1,...,n}, then we replace εjE(aj,bj)by the\noperator (−1)mµE(u,v)for any one j∈I, and update εiE(ai,bi)∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→εiE(ai,bi)·\nεjE(aj,bj)for alli∈I\\{j}(using Lemma 9(b)).\nExample 2.

This group perfectly stabilizes the post-measurement state |11⟩.\nIf we instead measure Y⊗I=E(10,10), and obtain the result +1, then the new\nstabilizersare S=⟨E(10,10),−E(11,11)⟩≡⟨E(10,10),−E(01,01)⟩.

Based on the stabilizer formalism (Section A.3),\nthe measured stabilizer replaces the first row (as indicated by the left arrow) and the\nsecond row is multiplied with the previous first row. For visual clarity, code stabilizer\nrows are boldfaced and binary vectors are written out in full. Furthermore, as per\nTheorem 6, this measurement of E(e1+e2,e1+e2)by Alice should imply that\nεA\n1E(e1+e2,e1+e2)T\nB⊗E(e1+e2,0)C=εA\n1E(e1+e2,e1+e2)B⊗E(e1+e2,0)C\nautomatically belongs t\nimply that\nεA\n1E(e1+e2,e1+e2)T\nB⊗E(e1+e2,0)C=εA\n1E(e1+e2,e1+e2)B⊗E(e1+e2,0)C\nautomatically belongs to the (new) stabilizer group. Indeed, this element can be\nproduced by multiplying the elements −E([eA\ni,eB\ni,eC\ni],[eA\ni,eB\ni,0C])fori= 1,2along\nwithYA1YA2IA3=E([(e1+e2)A,0B,0C],[(e1+e2)A,0B,0C])using Lemma 9(b). This\nis exactly how the seventh row gets updated.\n(2) Alice measures IA1YA2YA3=E([(e2+e3)A,0B,0C],[(e2+e3)A,0B,0C]), the second\nstabilizer, and the group gets updated as shown in Step (2) of Table 2. The procedure\nis very similar to that in Step (1).\nSince Alice has measured all her stabilizer generators, and the stabilizer formalism\npreserves the commutativity of the elements in the group, the third row in the first\nblock of 3 rows must necessarily commute with Alice’s stabilizers. Thus, the Alice\ncomponent of the third row must form a logical operator for Alice’s code, and we\ndefine it to be the logical Zoperator, i.e., ZA=ZZZ =E(0,e1+e2+e3). We will\nsee shortly that Bob’s qubits get the same code (possibly with sign changes for the\nstabilizers), so this third row can be written as the logical GHZ stabilizer ZAZBIC.\nThis phenomenon also generalizes to any [ [n,k,d ] ]stabilizer code, with some caveats\nwhen the code has some purely Z-type stabilizers, and we determine the logical Z\noperators either after Alice’s set of measurements or apriori using some linear alge-\nbraic arguments (see Appendix D.2 for details). Note that it is convenient to choose\nthe logical Zoperators such that they respect the GHZ structure of our analysis,\ne.g.,Z=IIYwill not be compatible here.\n(3) If we consider the parity-check matrix after Step (2), we see that rows 4 through 8 are\nthe stabilizers promised by Theorem 6 that act only on B and C systems. However,\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 43due to the same result, the C parts of rows 7 and 8 only have X-s instead of Y-s.

So,\nto change them back to Y-s, Alice applies the inverse of the Phase (i.e.,√\nZ) gate\nto all 3qubits of the C system. She specifically applies the inverse, rather than√\nZ\nitself, to get rid of the −1sign for the last row.\nFor a general stabilizer code, the appropriate diagonal Clifford must be chosen as dis-\ncussed in Appendix D.1. This operation converts εA\ni(−1)aibT\niE(ai,bi)B⊗E(ai,0)C,\nthe BC stabilizers, into εA\ni(−1)aibT\niE(ai,bi)B⊗E(ai,bi)C, which ensures that Charlie\ngets the same code (up to signs of stabilizers) as Alice and Bob. Since the Clifford is\nguaranteed to be diagonal, it leaves purely Z-type stabilizers unchanged. Later, in\nSection C.1, we show that it is better for Bob to perform this Clifford on Charlie’s\nqubits, rather than Alice.\nThough we have used the −YYXGHZ stabilizer here for convenience, for a general\ncode we can simply continue to use XXX. After Alice has measured her stabilizer\ngenerators, this last block of 3 rows could have changed but they still commute with\nthe generators. Since the middle block never gets affected by Alice’s measurements,\nwe can guarantee using Theorem 6 that two of the last 3 rows must be the joint BC\nstabilizers induced by Alice’s two generators. Hence, the remaining row’s Alice com-\nponent must form a logical operator for Alice’s code, and will be distinct from the\npreviously defined logical Zoperator. We define this to be the logical Xoperator,\ni.e.,XA=IIY =Y3=E(e3,e3). As we will see shortly, both Bob and Charlie get\nthe same code, so this last row of the third block can be written as the logical GHZ\nstabilizerXAXBXC. The generalization to arbitrary stabilizer codes is discussed in\nAppendix D.2.\nThen, she sends Bob both his qubits as well as Charlie’s qubits over a noisy Pauli\nchannel, which introduces the signs η,νi,µi∈{± 1},i= 1,2,3. She also classically\ncommunicates the code stabilizers, her syndromes {εA\n1,εA\n2}, and the logical ZandX\noperators to him.\n(4) Now, bas\nhe code stabilizers, her syndromes {εA\n1,εA\n2}, and the logical ZandX\noperators to him.\n(4) Now, based on Alice’s classical communication, Bob applies Theorem 6 to obtain the\nstabilizer generators\nεA\n1(YB1YB2IB3) (YC1YC2IC3) =εA\n1E(e1+e2,e1+e2)T\nB⊗E(e1+e2,e1+e2)C,\nεA\n2(IB1YB2YB3) (IC1YC2YC3) =εA\n2E(e2+e3,e2+e3)T\nB⊗E(e2+e3,e2+e3)C\nfor the induced joint code on his as well as Charlie’s qubits. As per Theorem 6, he\nalso includes{ZBiZCi=E([0A,0B,0C],[0A,eB\ni,eC\ni]) ;i= 1,2,3}i.e., theIZZ-type\nGHZ stabilizers, as stabilizer generators for the [ [6,1] ]joint code on BC systems. He\nmeasures these 5stabilizers to deduce and correct the error introduced by the chan-\nnel on the 6qubits sent by Alice. Assuming perfect error correction, the signs will\nbe back to the ones in Alice’s final parity-check matrix.\nWhen Bob sends Charlie’s qubits to him, the channel might introduce errors on those\n3qubits. To deduce and correct these errors, there must have been a code induced\non Charlie’s qubits even before the transmission . Hence, after correcting errors on\nthe6qubits of BC systems, Bob measures the same stabilizers as Alice’s code but\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 44on his qubits. This produces rows 4and5in Step (4) of Table 2, and row 6gets\nupdated as per the stabilizer formalism. When looking at rows 7and8of Step (3),\nit is evident that one can correspondingly multiply them with these new rows 4and\n5to produce the same code just on Charlie’s qubits.\nThis phenomenon extends to general stabilizer codes as well, where the joint stabiliz-\nersεA\ni(−1)aibT\niE(ai,bi)B⊗E(ai,bi)CaremultipliedwithBob’sstabilizers εB\niE(ai,bi)B\nto obtain Charlie’s stabilizers εA\niεB\ni(−1)aibT\niE(ai,bi)C(see Algorithm 2). Any purely\nZ-type stabilizer directly carries over to Charlie (without the above argument) as fol-\nlows. At the beginning of the protocol, we can rewrite the E([0A,0B,0C],[eA\ni,eB\ni,0C])\nrows such that a subset of them correspond to E([0A,\nwe can rewrite the E([0A,0B,0C],[eA\ni,eB\ni,0C])\nrows such that a subset of them correspond to E([0A,0B,0C],[zA,zB,0C]), where\nE(0,z)-s are the purely Z-type stabilizer generators of the code. This subset of\nrows will never be replaced by stabilizer measurements since they commute with\nother stabilizers. After Alice’s measurements, there will be rows corresponding to\nεA\nzE(0,z)A, which can be multiplied respectively with the aforesaid subset of rows\nto obtainεA\nzE(0,z)B. Just like we rewrote a subset of the first nrows, we can\nrewrite a subset of the second nrows to obtain E([0A,0B,0C],[0A,zB,zC]), which\nwhen multiplied with εA\nzE(0,z)Bproduces the desired εA\nzE(0,z)Cfor Charlie’s code.\nSee Appendix D.2 for some related discussion. In order to merge this phenomenon\nfor purelyZ-type operators with the general signs εA\niεB\ni(−1)aibT\nifor Charlie, we set\nεB\ni:= +1wheneverai= 0, as mentioned in Algorithm 2.\nNow, Bob has the parity-check matrix shown in Step (4) but without the new signs\nβ,α 1,α2,α3, whichwillbeintroducedbythechannelduringtransmissionofCharlie’s\nqubits. He sends Charlie his qubits (over a noisy Pauli channel), the code stabilizer\ngenerators, along with the corresponding signs {εA\n1εB\n1,εA\n2εB\n2}, and the logical Zand\nXoperators.\nFinally, Charlie measures these generators and fixes errors based on discrepancies in\nsigns with respect to {εA\n1εB\n1,εA\n2εB\n2}(the additional signs (−1)aibT\nido not make a difference\nfor this example). In the matrix in Step (4) of Table 2, after excluding the three sets of\ncode stabilizers, we see that there are 3rows left which exactly correspond to the logical\nGHZ stabilizers, where we have defined the logical operators Z=ZZZ,X=IIY =Y3for\nthe code. Therefore, we have shown that after all steps of the protocol, the logical qubits\nof A, B, and C are in the GHZ state. Since the signs of the stabilizer generators can be\ndifferent for each of the three parties, although their logical XandZoperators are the\nsame, the encoding unitary\n each of the three parties, although their logical XandZoperators are the\nsame, the encoding unitary can be slightly different. If they each perform the inverse of\ntheir respective encoding unitaries on their qubits, then the logical GHZ state is converted\ninto a physical GHZ state.\nIt might seem like this last step requires coordination among all three of them, which\nwould require two-way communications between parties. However, this is not necessary as\nAlice can perform the unitary on her qubits once she sends the 6qubits to Bob, and Bob\ncan perform the unitary on his qubits once he sends the 3qubits to Charlie. Subsequent\noperations will necessarily commute with these local unitaries as those qubits are not\ntouched by the remaining parties in the protocol.\nHence, we have illustrated a complete GHZ distillation protocol, although much care\nmust be taken while executing the steps for an arbitrary code. For example, the local\nClifford on C must be determined by solving a set of linear equations and finding a bi-\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 45nary symmetric matrix that specifies the diagonal Clifford, via the connection to binary\nsymplectic matrices [48, 49]. This is discussed in detail in Appendix D.1. Similarly, the\nlogical operators of the code that are compatible with our analysis of the protocol must be\ndetermined by simulating Alice’s part of the protocol and applying some linear algebraic\narguments. For a general [ [n,k,d ] ]code, there will be 3knon-code-stabilizer rows at the\nend, and one needs to identify kpairs of logical XandZoperators for the code from\nthese rows. Although any valid definition of logical Paulis would likely suffice, we use\nAlgorithm 3 to define them so that they naturally fit our analysis. The explanations for\nthe steps involved in this algorithm are given in Appendix D.2. In order to keep the main\npaper accessible, we have moved the discussion on implementation details to Appendix D.\n\nep the main\npaper accessible, we have moved the discussion on implementation details to Appendix D.\nC.1 Placement of Local Clifford and Distillation Performance\nIn our description of the protocol above, we mentioned that Alice performs the local Clif-\nford/parenleftig√\nZ†/parenrightig⊗3\non thequbits ofsystem Cin orderto make Charlie’s code the same as Alice’s\nand Bob’s. However, due to this operation, the joint BC code (in Step (4)) cannot distin-\nguish between Bob’s qubits and Charlie’s qubits. Indeed, consider the two-qubit operator\nXB1XC1. This commutes with all 5stabilizer generators of this code, although just XB1\nor justXC1would have anticommuted with the first generator (YB1YB2IB3) (YC1YC2IC3).\nTherefore, if the true error is XC1, then the maximum likelihood decoder will correct it\nwithXB1, which results in a logical error. Of course, the 3-qubit code only has distance\n1, but even if we consider the same 5-qubit code as in Section 4, the above phenomenon\nwill still occur. In effect, the induced joint BC code has distance dropping to 2whenever\nAlice’s code does not have any purely Z-type stabilizer. If we do not perform the diagonal\nClifford at all, then in such cases Charlie’s code will have only distance 1.\nTomitigatethis, wecaninsteadmake BobperformthesamediagonalCliffordoperation\non Charlie’s qubits. This ensures that the stabilizers for the BC code induced by Alice’s\ncode are of the form E(a,b)B⊗E(a,0)C, or justE(0,b)Bwhenever the stabilizer is purely\nZ-type. If Alice’s code has good distance properties, then this joint BC code will have\nat least that much protection for Bob’s qubits. Although the C parts of the stabilizers\nare purelyX-type, the additional GHZ stabilizers ZBiZCihelp in detecting X-errors on\nsystem C as well. Alternatively, one could make Alice perform one type of diagonal Clifford\nand Bob perform another diagonal Clifford, both on system C, to make both the BC code\nas well as Charlie’s code as good as possible. In future work, we will i\nC, to make both the BC code\nas well as Charlie’s code as good as possible. In future work, we will investigate these\ninteresting degrees of freedom.\nWe developed a MATLAB simulation of this protocol2and tested it using the [ [5,1,3] ]\nperfect code defined by S=⟨XZZXI, IXZZX, XIXZZ, ZXIXZ ⟩. The result is\nshown as the green curve marked ‘purely X code for C’ in Fig. 6. When compared to\nthe standard QEC performance of this code on the depolarizing channel, we see that the\nexponent is worse. This is because, by the arguments above, all non-purely Z-type stabi-\nlizers ofQ(S)get converted into a purely X-type stabilizer for Charlie’s code. To mitigate\nthis, we make Alice perform a local diagonal Clifford operation on qubits C to transform\nE(ai,0)CintoE(ai,bi)Clater. The performance of this is shown as the solid blue curve\nmarked‘samecodeforall’, whichisequallyworse. ThistimethereasonisthattheBCcode\nQ(S′)has stabilizers of the form E(ai,bi)B⊗E(ai,bi)C, which means that the code cannot\ndistinguish the i-th qubit of B and the i-th qubit of C. Finally, we make Bobperform the\naforesaid diagonal Clifford on qubits C, and this produces the solid dark red curve marked\n2Implementation available online: https://github.com/nrenga/ghz_distillation_qec\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

Then, the Rmatrices for P1= (P⊗I),P2= (I⊗P),and CZ are respectively\nRP1=/bracketleftigg\n1 0\n0 0/bracketrightigg\n,RP2=/bracketleftigg\n0 0\n0 1/bracketrightigg\n,andRCZ=/bracketleftigg\n0 1\n1 0/bracketrightigg\n.\nThis generalizes naturally to more than 2qubits. The diagonal entries of Rdescribe which\nqubits get acted upon by P, and the pairwise off-diagonal entries describe which pairs of\nqubits get acted upon by CZ [49].\nIn our protocol, from Theorem 6 we observed that Alice’s st\nirs of\nqubits get acted upon by CZ [49].\nIn our protocol, from Theorem 6 we observed that Alice’s stabilizers of the form\nE(ai,bi), withai̸= 0, become the stabilizer E(ai,0)for Charlie. This also means that\nany logical Xoperator of the form E(cj,dj)would have transformed into E(cj,0)(e.g.,\nsee last row of Step (2) in Table 2 and compare it to the last row of Step (3)). Therefore,\nthe purpose of the diagonal Clifford on qubits C is to convert the stabilizers E(ai,0)back\nintoE(ai,bi)and the logical XoperatorsE(cj,0)back intoE(cj,dj). Given the above\ninsight into diagonal Clifford operators, we want to find a binary symmetric matrix Rsuch\nthatURE(ai,0)U†\nR=E(ai,bi)for alli= 1,2,...,rX(using notation in Algorithm 3) and\nURE(cj,0)U†\nR=E(cj,dj)for allj= 1,2,...,k. Thus, we need a feasible solution Rfor\n{aiR=bi, i= 1,2,...,rX}and{cjR=dj, j= 1,2,...,k}.\nWe solve this system of linear equations on a binary symmetric matrix as follows. First,\nletAbe the matrix whose rows are {ai}and{cj}, and letBbe the matrix whose rows are\n{bi}and{dj}. Then, we have the system AR=B. We recall the vectorization property\nof matrices, which implies that\nvec(QUV ) = (VT⊗Q)vec(U). (81)\nHere, vectorization of a matrix is the operation of reading the matrix entries columnwise,\ntop to bottom, and forming a vector (e.g., this is done through the command U(:)in\nMATLAB). Setting Q=A,U =R,V =I, we get (I⊗A)vec(R) =vec(B), which is a\nstandard linear algebra problem for the unknown vector vec (R). However, we desire a\nbinarysymmetric matrixR. We impose this constraint as (I−W)vec(R) = 0, where 0\ndenotes the all-zeros vector of length n2, andWis the permutation matrix which trans-\nforms vec (Q)into vec (QT)for any matrix Q. In summary, we obtain the desired R(or\nequivalently the diagonal Clifford UR) by solving\nfindRs.t. (I⊗A)vec(R) =vec(B),\n(I−W)vec(R) = 0.

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 48D.2 Logical Paulis from GHZ Measurements\nThe procedure in Algorithm 3 to determine logical XandZgenerators of a stabilizer code\nis inspired by the stabilizer measurements on Bell or GHZ states, viewed through the lens\nof the stabilizer formalism for measurements (Section A.3). Though the algorithm could\nhave been constructed just using measurements on Bell states, we preferred GHZ states\nbecause there can be an additional non-trivial sign for the logical Xoperators due to an\nodd number of subsystems in the GHZ state. Of course, logical operators obtained using\nGHZ states will also apply to the Bell protocol since a negative sign on an even number\nof subsystems (A and B in Bell states) leads to an overall positive sign for XAXBand\nZAZB.\nWe have a codeQ(S)defined by its stabilizer group S=⟨εiE(ai,bi) ;i= 1,2,...,r =\nn−k⟩. Define the r×(2n+ 1)stabilizer (or parity-check) matrix H′whosei-th row is\n[ai,bi, εi]. First, we bring the first 2ncolumns of the stabilizer (or parity-check) matrix of\nthe code to the following standard form:\nH1:2n=/bracketleftigg\n0HZ\nH1H2/bracketrightigg\n. (83)\nHere, therZrows ofHZform all generators for the purely Z-type stabilizers of the code.\nThe bottom part of the matrix is such that the rX×nmatrixH1has full rank ( rX+rZ=\nr=n−k). While performing row operations on the initial parity-check matrix H′, one has\nto account for the Pauli multiplication rule i\nations on the initial parity-check matrix H′, one has\nto account for the Pauli multiplication rule in Lemma 9(b), and not simply perform binary\nsums of (the first 2ncolumns of the) rows, i.e., the last column of Hmust be updated to\nreflect changes in signs.\nNext, we simulate the creation of nGHZ states by creating a 2n×(6n+ 1)GHZ\nstabilizer matrix SGHZ, whose first nrows are [0,0,0, ei,ei,0,+1]and the second nrows\nare[ei,ei,ei,0,0,0,+1]. This matrix is the same as Step (0) of Table 2, but we have\nomitted the middle section since the measurements on subsystem Atrivially commute with\nentriesIAZBZCof this section. Now, we use the stabilizer formalism for measurements\n(Section A.3) to simulate measurements of the rows of Hon subsystem A of SGHZ. Clearly,\nthestabilizersfrom [0,HZ]commutewiththefirst nrows, sothesewillonlyreplace rZrows\nin the bottom half of SGHZ. The stabilizers from [H1,H2]will necessarily anticommute\nwith at least one of the first nrows ofSGHZ, and these rXrows get replaced. This can be\nestablished by counting the dimension of purely Z-type operators with which each row of\n[H1,H2]can commute, one after the other. Crucially, the stabilizer formalism guarantees\nthat all rows of the evolved SGHZremain linearly independent and always commute.\nThe(n−rX)non-replaced rows within the first nrows can be divided into two types.\nBeforewesimulateanystabilizermeasurements,thefirst nrowshavestandardbasisvectors\neifor theZ-parts of A and B. These can be rewritten such that we have rZrows of the form\n[0,0,0, z,z, 0,+1],wherezcorrespondstorowsof HZ,allofwhicharelinearlyindependent\nbyassumptionofthestandardform. Sincethesecorrespondtocodestabilizers(onAaswell\nas B), the measurement of rows of [H1,H2]will not replace these. After the measurements,\nwhenrZrows in the bottom half have been replaced by [0,0,0, z,0,0, εz], we can multiply\nwith the corresponding rows of the top half, i.e., [0,0,0, z,z, 0,+1], to produce purely\nZ-type stabilizers on subsystem B, which later def\nhalf, i.e., [0,0,0, z,z, 0,+1], to produce purely\nZ-type stabilizers on subsystem B, which later define Bob’s code. These Z-operators on\nB in the top half form the first type of rZrows. The remaining (n−rX)−rZ=krows\nform the second type, and they have to form logical ZAjZBj, forj= 1,2,...,k, since they\ncommute with all code stabilizers and the columns of subsystem C remain zero. Thus, the\nZ-component of subsystem A of these krows produce the logical Zgenerators of the code,\nand they always have sign +1.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 49A similar argument applies to the bottom half of the evolved SGHZmatrix. The stabi-\nlizer measurements from HZreplacerZrows out of the nrows. The remaining (n−rZ)\nrows can again be divided into two types. The first type of rows give operators that can\nbe rewritten as the BC stabilizers guaranteed by Theorem 6. Specifically, these can be\nidentified by the fact that their A-parts will be linearly dependent on the A-parts of the\nother rows of the evolved SGHZmatrix. Indeed, this is how one can cancel the A-parts of\ntheserXrows to produce the rXBC stabilizers corresponding to [H1,H2]. The remaining\n(n−rZ)−rX=krows of the bottom half form the second type, and they have to form\nlogicalX′\nAjX′\nBj, forj= 1,2,...,k, since they commute with all code stabilizers and are\nlinearly independent from all other rows. The A-parts of these rows are used to define the\nlogicalX′operators of the code. The primes on these logical operators indicate that they\nmight not exactly pair up with the corresponding logical Zoperators defined earlier. This\nis because they are only guaranteed to be logical operators independent of the logical Z\noperators, but not to be the appropriate pairs {Xj}of the previously determined {Zj}.\nOnce these pseudo logical Xoperators are determined, we can easily find the necessary\npairs for the logical Zoperators. Let the logical Zoperators be E(0,fi),i= 1,2,...,k,\nand let these pseudo \nor the logical Zoperators. Let the logical Zoperators be E(0,fi),i= 1,2,...,k,\nand let these pseudo logical Xoperators be νjE(cj,dj),j= 1,2,...,k. If they are the\ncorrect pairs, then we would get ⟨[0,fi],[cj,dj]⟩s=δijfor alli,j∈{1,2,...,k}, where\nδij= 1ifi=jand0otherwise. The symplectic inner product can be expressed as\n⟨[0,fi],[cj,dj]⟩s= [0,fi] Ω [cj,dj]T,where Ω =/bracketleftigg\n0In\nIn0/bracketrightigg\n.\nTherefore, if Fis the matrix whose rows are fiand[C,D]is the matrix whose rows are\n[cj,dj], then we need\n[0,F] Ω [C,D]T=:T=Ik.\nIfT̸=Ik, then we can simply pre-multiply the equation by T−1(mod 2) to achieve the\ndesired result. In this case, we redefine the logical Zoperators to be given by the rows of\nT−1[0,F]. This completes the reasoning behind Algorithm 3.\nAccepted in Quantum2024-01-11, click title to verify.

While distilling Bell pairs is the canonical setting, it is important to study the distillation\nof multipartite entangled states because these can be useful for realizing distributed algorithms on quantum networks. In this paper,\nwe study the distillation of GHZ states using quantum error correcting codes (QECCs). Using the stabilizer formalism, we begin\nby explaining the QECC-based Bell pair distillation protocol of Wilde et al. (2007), which relies particularly on the transpose\nsymmetry between Alice’s and Bob’s qubits in Bell states. Extending this idea, we show that, given nGHZ states, performing a\nmatrix on Alice’s qubits is equivalent to performing a “stretched” version of the transpose of the matrix on the qubits of Bob and\nCharlie. We call this mapping to the stretched version of the matrix the GHZ-map , and show that it is an algebra homomorphism.\nUsing this property, we show that Alice projecting her qubits onto an [ [n; k] ]stabilizer code implies the simultaneous projection of\nBob’s and Charlie’s qubits onto an induced [ [2n; k] ]stabilizer code. Guided by this insight, we develop a GHZ distillation protocol\nbased on local operations and classical communication that uses any stabilizer code. Inspired by stabilizer measurements on GHZ\nstates, we also develop a new algorithm to generate logical Pauli operators of any stabilizer code and use it in the protocol.\nSince quantum codes with ﬁnite rate and almost linear minimum distance have recently been discovered, this paper paves the\nway for high-rate high-output-ﬁdelity GHZ distillation. We provide simulation results on the 5-qubit perfect code to emphasize\nthe importance of the placement of a certain local Clifford o\n the 5-qubit perfect code to emphasize\nthe importance of the placement of a certain local Clifford operation in the protocol.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nEntanglement distillation, or puriﬁcation, is a well-studied problem in quantum information, where one typically starts with\nncopies of a noisy Bell pair, or a general mixed state, and distills kBell pairs of higher ﬁdelity [1]. Several teams of\nresearchers have worked on this problem, and the contributions range from fundamental limits [1]–[6] to simple and practical\nprotocols [2], [7]–[9]. Some schemes involve two-way communications between the involved parties while others only need\none-way communication. We focus on one-way schemes in this paper. While distilling (bipartite) Bell pairs is the canonical\nsetting, it is equally important to study the distillation of other multipartite entangled states because these can prove useful\nfor realizing various protocols on quantum networks [10]. Of course, if one can distill Bell pairs, then these can be used in\nsequence to entangle multiple parties, but direct distillation of an entangled resource between all parties is more efﬁcient [11].\nIn this paper, we propose a new protocol to directly distill GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states using quantum error\ncorrection (QEC). Since quantum code families with asymptotically constant rate and almost linear distance have recently been\ndiscovered [12]–[15], our work paves the way for high-rate high-output-ﬁdelity entanglement distillation.\nThe connection between one-way entanglement puriﬁcation protocols (1-EPPs) and quantum error correcting codes (QECCs)\nwas established by Bennett et al. in 1996 [2]. They showed that any QECC can be converted into a 1-EPP (and vice-versa)\nas follows. Given an [ [n;k;d ] ]QECC, they consider Alice generating kperfect Bell pairs, retaining one qubit of each pair,\nencoding the remaining kqubits intonqubits via the QECC, sending these nqubits to Bob via a teleportation channel induced\nby noisy shared Be\nts via the QECC, sending these nqubits to Bob via a teleportation channel induced\nby noisy shared Bell pairs between Alice and Bob, then Bob performing error correction on the received qubits, and ﬁnally Bob\ndecoding his qubits to obtain the kqubits that are entangled with the corresponding qubits of Alice. This is a natural way to\nuse a QECC for distilling higher ﬁdelity Bell pairs from the noisy Bell pairs shared between Alice and Bob. In his dissertation,\nAschauer [16] showed that 2-EPPs can also be constructed using QECCs, but there the code is only used for error detection.\nIn [4], Dür and Briegel provide a comprehensive review of entanglement puriﬁcation protocols constructed until 2007. As they\nshow, most of those protocols work on 2copies of a mixed state. Here, some initial operations are performed to entangle the\ntwo states, then certain measurement results on one copy imply that the other (unmeasured) copy now has higher ﬁdelity with\nrespect to the desired entangled resource state. While these can be generalized to n-to-kprotocols in several cases [4], such\nschemes are not always efﬁcient. Therefore, the framework of QECCs enables systematic n-to-kprotocols where the rate and\naverage output ﬁdelity are directly a function of the QECC performance when paired with a speciﬁc decoder.\nIn 2007, Wilde et al. [7] showed that any classical convolutional code can be used to distill Bell pairs via their entanglement\nassisted 1-EPP scheme. In the development of this scheme, they mention a potentially different method to use a QECC for\nperforming 1-EPP [7, Section II-D], compared to the aforementioned connection established initially by Bennett et al. in [2].\nTheir method forms the motivation for our work. Initially, Alice generates nperfect Bell pairs locally, marks one qubit of\neach pair as ‘A’ and the other as ‘B’, and measures the stabilizers of her chosen [ [n;k] ]code on qubits A. Due to a property\nof Bell states, this simultaneously projects qubits B onto an e\n]code on qubits A. Due to a property\nof Bell states, this simultaneously projects qubits B onto an equivalent code (see Section II-D). Then, she performs a local\nPauli operation on qubits A to ﬁx her obtained syndrome, shares her code stabilizers and syndrome with Bob through a\nN. Rengaswamy, N. Raveendran and B.

Using the Bell state identity, Bob measures\nthe appropriate code stabilizers on qubits B, and corrects channel errors by combining his syndrome with Alice’s syndrome.\nFinally, Alice and Bob decode their respective qubits, i.e., invert the encoding unitary for the code (see Section II-B), to convert\nthekBell pairs on the logical qubits into kphysical Bell pairs. Since the code helps correct some errors, on average the output\nBell pairs are of higher ﬁdelity than the initial nnoisy Bell pairs (obtained by sending qubits B to Bob).\nWhile the protocol is clear, it is not obvious why the logical qubits of Alice’s and Bob’s codes must form Bell pairs, assuming\nthat Bob’s error correction was successful. After discussing some background in Section II, we begin our contributions by\nexplaining the reason for the above phenomenon in Section III. We start with a state vector perspective for CSS (Calderbank-\nShor-Steane) codes [17], [18], and then use the stabilizer formalism [19] to address general stabilizer codes [20], [21], with\nthe5-qubit perfect code [20], [22] as an example. In the process, we also highlight the fact that it is convenient to choose the\nlogical Pa\nn example. In the process, we also highlight the fact that it is convenient to choose the\nlogical Pauli operators for the code in a way that is “compatible” with our analysis of the protocol. These choices determine\nthe respective encoding unitaries to be inverted at the end. Inspired by stabilizer measurements on Bell/GHZ states, we develop\na new algorithm to generate logical Paulis for any stabilizer code (see Algorithm 3 and its explanation in Appendix C-B),\nand use that in the protocol. Our approach using the stabilizer formalism also clariﬁes that the protocol has a non-zero error\nrate only because we disallow non-local measurements. Indeed, if Alice and Bob were allowed to make joint measurements\non qubits A and B together, then anyerror is correctable since the initial state is deterministically given by ncopies of the\nknown Bell state (see Remark 3). Given these insights, we proceed to investigate the distillation of GHZ states.\nAs in the Wilde et al. protocol, we consider only local operations and classical communications (LOCC), and assume that\nthese are noiseless. Since we are constructing a new GHZ distillation protocol based on a new insight on GHZ states, we have\nconsidered this simple model of noiseless LOCC and noisy qubit communications. While the problem of noisy local operations\nis important, and has received attention [4], [9], [23], [24], we leave these investigations on our protocol for future work.\nWe begin Section IV by exploring an extension of the Bell state matrix identity (“transpose trick”) to GHZ states. Given n\ncopies of the GHZ state, whose three subsystems are marked ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’, we ﬁnd that applying a matrix on qubits A is\nequivalent to applying a “stretched” version of the matrix on qubits B and C together (see Lemma 4). We call this mapping to\nthe stretched version of the matrix the GHZ-map , and prove that it is an algebra homomorphism [25], i.e., linear, multiplicative,\nand hence projector-preserving. Recollect that we are \nomorphism [25], i.e., linear, multiplicative,\nand hence projector-preserving. Recollect that we are interested in measuring stabilizers on qubits A and understanding its\neffect on the remaining qubits. Using the properties of the GHZ-map, we show that it sufﬁces to consider only the simple\ncase of a single stabilizer. With this great simpliﬁcation, we prove that imposing a given [ [n;k;d ] ]stabilizer code on qubits\nA simultaneously imposes a certain [ [2n;k;d0] ]stabilizer code jointly on qubits B and C. By performing diagonal Clifford\noperations on Charlie’s qubits, which commutes with Alice’s measurements, one can vary the distance d0of the induced BC\ncode. Then, we use this core technical result to devise a protocol that distills GHZ states using any stabilizer code. We perform\nsimulations on the [ [5;1;3] ]perfect code and compare the protocol failure rate to the logical error rate of the code on the\nappropriate Pauli channel. In terms of error exponents, we show that it is always better for Bob to perform a local diagonal\nClifford operation on Charlie’s qubits, rather than Alice doing the same. We support the empirical observation with an analytical\nargument on the induced BC code and Charlie’s code. Finally, we ﬁnish by showing that the average output k-qubit density\nmatrix of the protocol is diagonal in the GHZ-basis, and its ﬁdelity is directly dictated by the protocol’s failure rate.\nAs mentioned above, our noise model here is a Pauli channel for qubit communications, combined with noiseless LOCC. It\nis common in the literature to consider distillation of GHZ states when the initial noisy states are diagonal in the GHZ-basis.\nHowever, in [26], the authors show that it is possible to distill a perfect GHZ state from two copies of a non-GHZ-diagonal\ninitial state, as long as some conditions are satisﬁed. They also show that these states are better than GHZ-diagonal states for\ndistillation of GHZ states. Using their insight, they are able to apply their schem\ngonal states for\ndistillation of GHZ states. Using their insight, they are able to apply their scheme for practical noisy environments such as the\namplitude-damping channel. While this work also considers a 2-to-1protocol, in the future, we plan to integrate our insights\nwith theirs to develop systematic QECC-based n-to-kprotocols that are operable on more general channels than the simple\nPauli channel considered here.\nII.

For\ndetails about extending the deﬁnition of E(a;b)toZ4-valued arguments, see [28].\nB. Stabilizer Codes and Encoding Unitaries\nA stabilizer group Sis a commutative subgroup of Pnthat does not contain \u0000IN.

Since the generators are\nHermitian and unitary, they have eigenvalues \u00061. Recollect that commuting matrices can be diagonalized simultaneously. The\nstabilizer code deﬁned by Sis the common +1eigenspace of all generators, i.e., it is the 2k-dimensional subspace, k=n\u0000r,\nﬁxed by all elements of S:\nQ(S):=fj i2CN:gj i=j i 8g2Sg: (5)\nUsing the homomorphism \r, we can write a r\u0002(2n+ 1) generator matrix GSfor the stabilizer group: the ithrow ofGS\nis[ai;bi; \"i]2F2n\n2\u0002f\u0006 1g. SinceSmust be a commutative group, the symplectic inner product between any pair of rows\nmust be zero. Hence, the subspace of binary mappings of all elements of S, denoted\r(S), is given by the rowspace of GS.\nA CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code is a special type of stabilizer code for which there exists a set of generators where\neitherbi= 0 orai= 0 in each generator, i.e., the generators are purely X-type and purely Z-type operators. Clearly, for such\na code,GShas a block diagonal form where we can express the X-type (resp. Z-type) operators as the rowspace of a matrix\n[HX;0](resp. [0;HZ]), and 0represents the all-zeros matrix (of appropriate size). In this case, the commutativity condition\nfor stabilizers is equivalent to the condition HXHT\nZ= 0. Therefore\nase, the commutativity condition\nfor stabilizers is equivalent to the condition HXHT\nZ= 0. Therefore, HXandHZcan be thought of as generating two classical\nlinear codesCXandCZ.\nThe projector onto the +1eigenspace of a Pauli matrix E(a;b)isIN+E(a;b)\n2. Therefore, since Q(S)is the simultaneous\n+1eigenspace of rcommuting matrices \"iE(ai;bi), the projector onto the code subspace Q(S)is\n\u0005S=rY\ni=1(IN+\"iE(ai;bi))\n2=1\n2rX\nm=[m1;:::;m r]2Fr\n2rY\ni=1(\"iE(ai;bi))mi=1\n2rX\n\"E(a;b)2S\"E(a;b): (6)\nWhile the stabilizer group Sdeﬁnes the code space, an encoding unitary UEnc(S)fully speciﬁes the mapping from logical\nk-qubit states to physical n-qubit code states in Q(S). Theninput qubits toUEnc(S)can be split into klogical qubits, whose\njoint state is arbitrary, and r=n\u0000kancillary qubits, each of which is initialized in some speciﬁc state such as j0i. If ancillas\nare initialized in the j0istate, then the stabilizer group for these ninput qubits is generated by fZi;i=k+ 1;k+ 2;:::;ng,\nsinceZj0i=j0i. If we conjugate each of these rgenerators by the encoding unitary UEnc(S), then we will obtain rgenerators\nUEnc(S)ZiUEnc(S)yofS. Similarly, if we conjugate the XiandZioperations on the klogical qubits — which can be used\nto express arbitrary operations on them since Pauli operators form a basis — by UEnc(S), then we will obtain the generators\nof logicalXandZoperators compatible with the chosen UEnc(S). Therefore, an alternative method to specify UEnc(S)is to\nspecify the generators of Sas well as the generators of logical XandZoperators. Since we are requiring UEnc(S)to map\nPaulis to Paulis, it is always Clifford [19]. Note that UEnc(S)is still not unique since we are not specifying how Xion the\nancillas must be mapped, but we do not care about these additional mappings.4\nThere are at least two algorithms provided in the literature for generating the logical Pauli operators of stabilizer codes.\nOne is by Gottesman [20], [29], where the idea is to construct the normalizer of the stabilizer grou\nOne is by Gottesman [20], [29], where the idea is to construct the normalizer of the stabilizer group inside the Pauli group,\nand then perform suitable row operations on the generators of the normalizer. The other is by Wilde [30], where he performs\na symplectic Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to arrive at the generators of logical Xand logical Zoperators. In\nthis work, as part of our GHZ distillation protocol, we provide a new algorithm to generate logical XandZoperators for\nany stabilizer code (see Algorithm 3). The output of the algorithm is compatible with the way logical Paulis must be deﬁned\nfor our analysis of the protocol. Additionally, the logical Zoperators from our algorithm are always guaranteed to be purely\nZ-type operators for any stabilizer code. If the code is CSS, then the logical Xoperators are always purely X-type.\nC. Stabilizer Formalism\nWhen a stabilizer group on nqubits hasnindependent generators, Q(S)is a1-dimensional subspace that corresponds to\na unique quantum state j (S)i(up to an irrelevant global phase), commonly referred to as a stabilizer state [20]. The actions\nof unitary operations and measurements on j (S)ican be tracked by updating these ngenerators accordingly [19], [31]. For\nany element gofS, and an arbitrary unitary operation Uonj (S)i, we observe that\nUj (S)i=U\u0001g\u0001j (S)i= (UgUy)\u0001Uj (S)i; (7)\nso the stabilizer element ghas evolved into the element g0=UgUyafter the action of U. Of course, only if Uis a Clifford\noperation we have that g0is also a Pauli matrix. Thus, in this case the evolution of the state can be tracked efﬁciently by\nsimply transforming GS(and the associated signs) through binary operations (see “CHP” algorithm [31]).\nThe stabilizer formalism also provides a method to systematically update the stabilizers under Pauli measurements of the\nstatej (S)i. Assume that we have ngenerators for the stabilizer group, namely \"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;n , and that we are\nmeasuring the Pauli operator \u0016E(u;v)to obtain the meas\namely \"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;n , and that we are\nmeasuring the Pauli operator \u0016E(u;v)to obtain the measurement (\u00001)m;m2f0;1g. Then, we have the following cases.\n1) Ifh[u;v];[ai;bi]is= 0 for alli, then either E(u;v)or\u0000E(u;v)already belongs to S, so there is nothing to update.\n2) Ifh[u;v];[aj;bj]is= 1 for exactly one j2f1;:::;ng, then we replace \"jE(aj;bj)by(\u00001)m\u0016E(u;v).\n3) Ifh[u;v];[ai;bi]is= 1 fori2I\u0012f 1;:::;ng, then we replace \"jE(aj;bj)by(\u00001)m\u0016E(u;v)for any one j2I, and\nupdate\"iE(ai;bi)7!\"iE(ai;bi)\u0001\"jE(aj;bj)for alli2Infjg(using Lemma 1(b)).\nExample 1. Consider the standard Bell state j\b+i=j00i+j11ip\n2, whose stabilizer group is S=hX\nX;Z\nZi=\nhE(11;00);E(00;11)i. If we measure Z\nI=E(00;10), and obtain the result \u00001, then the new stabilizers are S=\nh\u0000E(00;10);E(00;11)i\u0011h\u0000E(00;10);\u0000E(00;01)i. This group perfectly stabilizes the post-measurement state j11i.\nIf we instead measure Y\nI=E(10;10), and obtain the result +1, then the new stabilizers are S=hE(10;10);\u0000E(11;11)i\u0011\nhE(10;10);\u0000E(01;01)i. This group perfectly stabilizes the post-measurement state(j0i+{j1i)p\n2\n(j0i\u0000{j1i)p\n2.\nD. Bell State Matrix Identity\nLetnstandard Bell pairs be shared between Alice and Bob. We rearrange the 2nqubits to keep Alice’s qubits together and\nBob’s qubits together. We can write the joint state as\n\f\f\b+\nn\u000B\nAB=\u0012j00iAB+j11iABp\n2\u0013\nn\n=1p\n2nX\nx2Fn\n2jxiAjxiB: (8)\nLetM=P\nx;y2Fn\n2Mxyjxihyj2C2n\u00022nbe any matrix acting on Alice’s qubits. Then, it has been observed that [2], [7]\n(M\nI)j\b+\nni=1p\n2nX\nx;y2Fn\n2MxyjxiAjyiB (9)\n=1p\n2nX\nx;y2Fn\n2jxiA(MT)yxjyiB(10)\n= (I\nMT)j\b+\nni: (11)\nExample 2. As in Example 1, consider the standard Bell pair and measure Y\nI. If the measurement result is +1, then\nthe projector PY=I2+Y\n2gets applied to the ﬁrst qubit. Then, according to the above identity, this is equivalent to applying\nPT\nY=I2\u0000Y\n2on the second qubit. This exactly agrees with the post-measurement state(j0i+{j1i)p\n2\n(j0i\u0000{j1i)p\n2.\nIf Alice measures the generators of a stabilizer group S=h\"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;ri, an\n\n(j0i\u0000{j1i)p\n2.\nIf Alice measures the generators of a stabilizer group S=h\"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;ri, and obtains results (\u00001)mi;mi2\nf0;1g;thenM= \u0005S0is the projector onto the subspace Q(S0)of the stabilizer code deﬁned by S0=h(\u00001)mi\"iE(ai;bi);i=\n1;:::;ri.

Note that, in such cases where Mis a projector, we can write\n(M\nI)j\b+\nni= (M2\nI)j\b+\nni= (M\nMT)j\b+\nni; (13)\nso that the action of Alice can be interpreted as both Alice and Bob projecting their own qubits simultaneously.\nIII. R EVISITING THE BELLPAIRDISTILLATION PROTOCOL\nIn Ref. [7], Wilde et al. described a protocol to distill Bell pairs using an arbitrary quantum stabilizer code. We reiterate\nthis protocol here and provide more clarity on the reasons behind its working. Then, in the next section, we will generalize\nthis protocol to distill GHZ states, i.e., the 3-qubit entangled state jGHZi=1p\n2(j000i+j111i).\nInitially, Alice generates ncopies of the Bell state j\b+i(n“ebits”), rearranges the qubits as described above, and sends\nBob’s set of nqubits to him over a noisy channel. It is not necessary that Alice must prepare Bell pairs locally and then\ntransmit half the qubits to Bob. Indeed, the protocol is applicable as long as Alice and Bob share some initial (noisy) Bell\npairs. Then, Alice measures the stabilizers of a quantum stabilizer code deﬁned by S=h\"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;rion her\nqubits, with \"i=\u00061. Let her measurement results be (\u00001)mi;mi2f0;1g. This projects her qubits onto the codespace ﬁxed\nby the stabilizers S0=h(\u00001)mi\"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;ri. Alice applies some suitable Pauli “correcti\nxed\nby the stabilizers S0=h(\u00001)mi\"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;ri. Alice applies some suitable Pauli “correction” to bring her qubits\nAlgorithm 1: Algorithm to convert nBell pairs into kBell pairs of higher quality, using an [ [n;k;d ] ]stabilizer code\nResult: Alice and Bob share kperfect Bell pairs or at least one of the kpairs has an unknown Pauli error\nInput :nBell pairsj\b+i\nnat Alice, [ [n;k;d ] ]stabilizer codeQ(S)deﬁned by a stabilizer group S\nOutput:kBell pairs of higher quality shared between Alice and Bob if channel introduces a correctable error\n1Initialization: Rearrange the 2nqubits inj\b+i\nnto obtainj\b+\nni(8) for processing by Alice and Bob respectively\n2\n3Alice\n4(a) measures all the stabilizer generators f\"iE(ai;bi) ;i= 1;2;:::;r =n\u0000kgon hernqubits, obtains syndrome,\n5(b) sends the remaining nqubits to Bob over a noisy quantum channel,\n6(c) sends the stabilizers and syndrome (which together deﬁne Q(S)) to Bob over a noiseless classical channel.\n7\n8Bob\n9(a) measures all the stabilizer generators f\"iE(ai;bi) ;i= 1;2;:::;r =n\u0000kgon hisnqubits,\n10(b) combines the syndrome information from Alice as well as his measurements and interprets using Section II-D,\n11(c) performs necessary Pauli corrections on his qubits to bring them to the code space of Q(S).\n12\n13// If the channel error was correctable, pairs of logical qubits of Alice’s and Bob’s codes form kBell states\n14// If channel error was NOT correctable, some pair of logical qubits form a Bell state with an unknown Pauli error\n15Alice and Bob respectively apply the inverse of the encoding unitary for their code on their nqubits\n16// The encoding unitary is determined by the logical Pauli operators for Q(S)obtained from Algorithm 36\nback to the code subspace Q(S)(rather thanQ(S0)), if that is the code she desires to use. She classically communicates the\nchosen stabilizers, S, the measurements fmigr\ni=1, and the Pauli correction to Bob.\nAlthough we use the term “correction”, there is really no error on Alice’s qubits\ncorrection to Bob.\nAlthough we use the term “correction”, there is really no error on Alice’s qubits. Instead, the terminology is used to indicate\nthat Alice brings the qubits to her desired code space. Furthermore, even if there is some error on Alice’s qubits, one can map\nit to an equivalent error on Bob’s qubits using the Bell state matrix identity (Section II-D).\nNote that the authors of Ref. [7] do not explicitly mention that the Pauli correction needs to be communicated, but it could\nbe necessary in situations where Alice’s and Bob’s decoders are not identical or have some randomness embedded in them.\nIn a similar vein, Alice might also have to classically communicate the generators of the logical Pauli operators of the code,\nso that Bob exactly knows which encoding circuit to invert at the end of the protocol. Though any appropriate deﬁnition of\nlogical Pauli generators likely works with the protocol, we employ Algorithm 3 to obtain generators that are “compatible”\nwith our way of analyzing the protocol (using the stabilizer formalism). This phenomenon will become more clear after the\n[ [5;1;3] ]code example in this section. While the algorithm simulates measurements on GHZ states to deﬁne logical Paulis, an\nequivalent algorithm can be constructed that only simulates Bell measurements.\nRemark 2. In this protocol, whenever the syndrome of Alice is non-trivial, i.e., at least one miequals 1, she can either\nperform a Pauli correction or just deﬁne her code to be Q(S0)and not perform any correction. If the protocol is deﬁned so\nthat she always does the latter, as depicted in Fig. 1 where there is no ‘Recovery’ block on Alice’s qubits, then Bob can adjust\nhis processing accordingly based on the syndrome information from Alice.\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that Alice sends Bob’s qubits to him only after performing her measurements\nand any Pauli correction. So, the channel applies a Pauli error only after Bob’s qubits got projected according to S00=\nh(\u0000\nn. So, the channel applies a Pauli error only after Bob’s qubits got projected according to S00=\nh(\u00001)mi+aibT\ni\"iE(ai;bi);i= 1;:::;ri. Now, Bob measures the stabilizers \"iE(ai;bi)and applies corrections on his qubits\nusing his syndromes as well as Alice’s syndromes (and the Bell matrix identity, which in particular involves the transpose).\nThis projects his qubits to the same codespace as Alice. Finally, Alice and Bob locally apply the inverse of the encoding\nunitary for their code, UEnc(S)y. If Bob’s correction was successful, this converts the klogical Bell pairs into kphysical Bell\npairs that are of higher quality than the nBell pairs initially shared between them. This protocol is shown in Figure 1 and\nsummarized in Algorithm 1.\nWhile the steps of the protocol are clear, it is not obvious why the logical qubits of Alice and Bob have to be kcopies of\nthe Bell pair, assuming all errors were corrected successfully. To get some intuition, let us quickly consider the example of\nthe3-qubit bit-ﬂip code deﬁned by S=hZZI;IZZi. According to (6), the projector onto Q(S)is\u0005S=(I8+ZZI)\n2(I8+IZZ)\n2.\nThe encoding unitary, as described in Section II-B, is UEnc=CNOT 1!2CNOT 1!3. SinceZT=Z, Alice’s measurements will\nproject Bob’s qubits onto the same code subspace as her’s. For convenience, assume that Alice obtains the trivial syndrome\n(+1;+1) and that the channel does not introduce any error. Then, according to (13), the resulting (unnormalized) state after\nAlice’s measurements is (\u0005S\n\u0005S)\f\f\b+\n3\u000B\n.\nConsider the action of (I8+ZZI)on a computational basis state jxi;x= [x1;x2;x3]2F3\n2:\n(I8+ZZI)jxi=jxi+E(000;110)jxi=jxi+ (\u00001)[1;1;0]xTjxi=(\n2jxiifx1\bx2= 0;\n0 otherwise:(14)\nHence, after the action of (\u0005S\n\u0005S)and inversion of the encoding unitary by Alice and Bob, we obtain\n(\u0005S\n\u0005S)\f\f\b+\n3\u000B\n=1\n16\u0001p\n23X\nx2f000;111g4jxiA\n4jxiB(15)\n/j000iAj000iB+j111iAj111iB (16)\n(Uy\nEnc)A\n(Uy\nEnc)B\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000!j 000iAj000iB+j100iAj100iB(17)\n=j00iAB\nj00iAB\nj00iAB+j11iAB\nj00iAB\nj00iAB(18)\n= (j00iAB+j11iAB)\nj00iA\n 000iAj000iB+j100iAj100iB(17)\n=j00iAB\nj00iAB\nj00iAB+j11iAB\nj00iAB\nj00iAB(18)\n= (j00iAB+j11iAB)\nj00iAB\nj00iAB: (19)\nThus, the output is a single Bell pair and ancillary qubits on Alice and Bob. In Appendix A, we show this phenomenon for\narbitrary CSS codes by generalizing the state vector approach used above.\nA. Bell Pair Distillation using the 5-Qubit Code\nIn the remainder of this section, with the [ [5;1;3] ]code [2], [22] as an example, we use the stabilizer formalism to show\nthat the above phenomenon is true for any stabilizer code. Recall that this code is deﬁned by\nS=hXZZXI; IXZZX; XIXZZ; ZXIXZ i: (20)7\nAs described in Section II-B, the corresponding binary stabilizer matrix is given by\nGS=2\n6641 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 +1\n0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 +1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 +1\n0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 +13\n775: (21)\nInitially, Alice starts with 5copies of the standard Bell state j\b+i\n5, and marks one qubit of each copy as Bob’s. She does\nnot yet send Bob’s qubits to him. The stabilizer group for this joint state of 5 “ebits” (or “EPR pairs”) is\nE5=hXA1XB1; ZA1ZB1; X A2XB2; ZA2ZB2; X A3XB3; ZA3ZB3; X A4XB4; ZA4ZB4; X A5XB5; ZA5ZB5i (22)\n=hXAiXBi=E([eA\ni;eB\ni];[0A;0B]); Z AiZBi=E([0A;0B];[eA\ni;eB\ni]) ;i= 1;2;:::; 5i; (23)\nwhereei2F5\n2is the standard basis vector with a 1in positioniand zeros elsewhere, 02F5\n2is the all-zeros vector, and the\nX- andZ- components in the E(a;b)notation have been split into Alice’s qubits and Bob’s qubits. Observe that this is a\nmaximal stabilizer group on 10qubits and hence, there are no non-trivial logical operators associated with this group, i.e., the\nnormalizer ofE5inP10is itself.\nIt will be convenient to adopt a tabular format for these generators, where the ﬁrst column of each row gives the sign of the\ngenerator, the next two columns give the X-components of Alice and Bob in that generator, the subsequent two columns give\ntheZ-components of Alice and Bob in that generator, and the last column gives the Pauli representation of that generator for\ncla\n Bob in that generator, and the last column gives the Pauli representation of that generator for\nclarity. Hence, the above generators are written as follows.\nSign X-Components Z-Components Pauli Representation\nA B A B\n+1 ei ei 0 0 XAiXBi=E([eA\ni;eB\ni];[0A;0B])\n+1 0 0 ei eiZAiZBi=E([0A;0B];[eA\ni;eB\ni])\nGiven this “initialization”, let us track these 10stabilizers through each step of the protocol, as shown in Table I.\n(1) Alice measures the ﬁrst stabilizer generator XA1ZA2ZA3XA4, and assume that the measurement result is \"12f\u0006 1g.\nWe apply the stabilizer formalism for measurements from Section II-C to update E5. Since there are several elements\nofE5that anticommute with this generator, we choose to remove1ZA4ZB4=E([0A;0B];[eA\n4;eB\n4])and replace all other\nanticommuting elements by their product with ZA4ZB4. Let this updated group in Step (1) of Table I be denoted as E(1)\n5.\nFor visual clarity, code stabilizer rows are boldfaced and binary vectors are written out in full.\nNow, we observe that if Bob measures the same generator on his qubits, i.e., XB1ZB2ZB3XB4, then it is trivial because it\ncommutes with all elements in E(1)\n5and hence is already contained in E(1)\n5. This is a manifestation of the Bell state matrix\nidentity discussed in Section II-D. Indeed, Bob’s generator can be obtained by multiplying XA1XB1;XA4XB4;ZA2ZB2,\nZA3ZB3;andXA1ZA2ZA3XA4in Step (1) of Table I.\n(2) Alice measures the second stabilizer generator XA2ZA3ZA4XA5, and assume that the measurement result is \"22f\u0006 1g.\nThen, the new joint stabilizer group, E(2)\n5, is given in Step (2) of Table I. This stabilizer generator anticommutes with\nthe third row of the top block and the second and ﬁfth rows of the bottom block. We have replaced ZA5ZB5(ﬁfth row of\nthe bottom block) with this generator and multiplied the other anticommuting elements with ZA5ZB5. It can be veriﬁed\nthat the second stabilizer generator of Bob is already in E(2)\n5.\n(3) Alice measures the third stabilizer generator XA1XA3ZA4ZA5, and \nor of Bob is already in E(2)\n5.\n(3) Alice measures the third stabilizer generator XA1XA3ZA4ZA5, and assume that the measurement result is \"32f\u0006 1g.\nThen, the new joint stabilizer group, E(3)\n5, is given in Step (3) of Table I. Once again, it can be veriﬁed that the third\nstabilizer generator of Bob is already in E(3)\n5. The minus sign in the fourth row of the top block gets introduced when\nwe apply the multiplication rule for E(a;b)from Lemma 1(b).\n(4) Alice measures the ﬁnal stabilizer generator ZA1XA2XA4ZA5, and assume that the measurement result is \"42f\u0006 1g.\nThen, the new joint stabilizer group, E(4)\n5, is given in Step (4) of Table I. As before, it can be veriﬁed that the ﬁnal\nstabilizer generator of Bob is already in E(4)\n5. This completes all measurements of Alice, and she now sends Bob’s qubits\nover the channel. To understand the working of the protocol in the ideal scenario, assume that no errors occur.\n1Later, in the GHZ protocol, we restrict this choice to be the ﬁrst element in the table that anticommutes with the measured stabilizer.8\nTABLE I: Steps of the Bell-pair distillation protocol based on the [ [5;1;3] ]code.

Then, by\ngrouping Alice’s code stabilizers and Bob’s code stabilizers, the group E(4)\n5can be rewritten as\nE(4)\n5=h\"1XA1ZA2ZA3XA4; \"2XA2ZA3ZA4XA5; \"3XA1XA3ZA4ZA5; \"4ZA1XA2XA4ZA5;\nE([(e1+e5)A;(e1+e5)B];[eA\n3;\nE(4)\n5=h\"1XA1ZA2ZA3XA4; \"2XA2ZA3ZA4XA5; \"3XA1XA3ZA4ZA5; \"4ZA1XA2XA4ZA5;\nE([(e1+e5)A;(e1+e5)B];[eA\n3;eB\n3]);\u0000E([(e1+e4+e5)A;(e1+e4+e5)B];[eA\n5;eB\n5]);\n\"1XB1ZB2ZB3XB4; \"2XB2ZB3ZB4XB5; \"3XB1XB3ZB4ZB5; \"4ZB1XB2XB4ZB5i: (25)\nUsing some manipulations, we recognize that the two operators on the second line in E(4)\n5are\nE([(e1+e5)A;(e1+e5)B];[eA\n3;eB\n3]) = (XA1ZA3XA5)(XB1ZB3XB5)\u0011ZAZB;\n\u0000E([(e1+e4+e5)A;(e1+e4+e5)B];[eA\n5;eB\n5]) = ({XA1XA4YA5)({XB1XB4YB5)\u0011XAXB: (26)\nThus,E(4)\n5can be interpreted as having 8stabilizer generators (Alice and Bob combined) and a pair of logical XAXBand\nlogicalZAZBoperators, which implies that the pair of logical qubits shared between Alice and Bob forms a Bell pair. This\ncan be converted into a physical Bell pair by performing the inverse of the encoding unitary on both Alice’s and Bob’s qubits\nlocally. Note that this encoding unitary must be compatible with the above deﬁnition of the logical Paulis for the [ [5;1;3] ]code,\ni.e., when the physical XandZon the input (logical) qubit to the encoder is conjugated by the chosen encoding unitary, the\nresult must be the above logical Paulis XandZ, respectively, potentially multiplied by some stabilizer element.\nRemark 3. In this example, we have assumed that Bob’s qubits do not suffer any error, so that we can clearly show the\nexistence of the correct logical Bell stabilizers. If, however, the channel introduced an error, then Alice and Bob can jointly\ndeduce the error by measuring the signs of all generators of E(1)\n5and applying the necessary Pauli correction. Since there are\nno non-trivial logical Pauli operators, any syndrome-matched correction can differ from the true error only by a stabilizer, so\nany error is correctable by the joint action of Alice and Bob. But, since we prohibit non-local measurements between Alice\nand Bob, our error correction capability is limited to that of the code (on Bob’s side). If the channel introduces a correctable\nPauli error for the chosen code and Bob’s decoder, the\nide). If the channel introduces a correctable\nPauli error for the chosen code and Bob’s decoder, then the protocol will output kperfect Bell pairs. However, if the Pauli\nerror is miscorrected by Bob’s decoder, then there will be a logical error on the code, and hence at least one of the koutput\nBell pairs will suffer from an unknown Pauli error.\nWe can arrive at the above conclusion without knowing the speciﬁc logical operators for the code. After Alice measures\nall her stabilizer generators, we know that Bob’s stabilizer generators will also be present in the group, simply based on the\nBell state matrix identity from Section II-D. For this example, the transpose in that identity did not make a difference, but\nfor other codes this can only introduce an additional minus sign since YT=\u0000Y. For an [ [n;k;d ] ]code, we now have a\n2n-qubit stabilizer group E(n\u0000k)\nn where 2(n\u0000k)generating elements are Alice’s and Bob’s stabilizer generators. We are left\nwith 2n\u00002(n\u0000k) = 2kelements in the generators, each of which must jointly involve Alice’s and Bob’s qubits. These\ncommute with each other and with the 2(n\u0000k)stabilizer generators of Alice and Bob, and are independent, so we can rename\nthem as the logical XAjXBjand logicalZAjZBjforj= 1;2;:::;k . Thus, by deﬁnition , thekpairs of logical qubits form k\nlogical Bell pairs. Alice and Bob can produce physical Bell pairs by simultaneously inverting the (same) encoding unitary for\nthe code locally. This is the key idea behind the working of the Bell pair distillation protocol employed by Wilde et al. in [7].\nIV. D ISTILLATION OF GREENBERGER -HORNE -ZEILINGER (GHZ) S TATES\nIn this section, we extend the above Bell pair distillation protocol to distill GHZ states, jGHZi=(j000i+j111i)p\n2. LetnGHZ\nstates be shared between Alice, Bob, and Charlie. We rearrange all the qubits to keep Alice’s, Bob’s and Charlie’s qubits\ntogether respectively. Hence, this joint state can be expressed as\njGHZniABC=\u0012j000iABC+j111iABCp\n2\u0013\nn\n=1p\n2nX\nx2Fn\n2jxiA\ny. Hence, this joint state can be expressed as\njGHZniABC=\u0012j000iABC+j111iABCp\n2\u0013\nn\n=1p\n2nX\nx2Fn\n2jxiAjxiBjxiC: (27)\nSince the GHZ state has stabilizers SGHZ=hZAZBIC; IAZBZC; X AXBXCi, the stabilizers for jGHZniABCare\nS\nn\nGHZ=hZAiZBiICi; IAiZBiZCi; X AiXBiXCi;i= 1;2;:::;ni: (28)10\nThus, we have identiﬁed the GHZ version of the basic properties of Bell states that was needed in the Bell pair distillation\nprotocol. However, the critical part of the Wilde et al. protocol was the transpose trick that formed the Bell matrix identity\nin Section II-D. When applied to stabilizer codes, this implied that each stabilizer generator \"E(a;b)of Alice is transformed\ninto the generator \"E(a;b)T=\"(\u00001)abTE(a;b)(using Lemma 1(a)) for Bob. Naturally, we need to determine the equivalent\nphenomenon for GHZ states before we can proceed to constructing a distillation protocol.\nA. GHZ State Matrix Identity\nIn the following lemma, we generalize the Bell state matrix identity in Section II-D to the GHZ state.\nLemma 4. LetM=P\nx;y2Fn\n2Mxyjxihyj2C2n\u00022nbe any matrix acting on Alice’s qubits. Then,\n(MA\nIBC)jGHZniABC=\u0010\nIA\n\u0010dMT\u0011\nBC\u0011\njGHZniABC;‘GHZ-map’ :M7!cM:=X\nx;y2Fn\n2Mxyjx;xihy;yj2C22n\u000222n:\nProof: Similar to the Bell case, we calculate\n(MA\nIBC)jGHZniABC=1p\n2nX\nx;y2Fn\n2MxyjxiAjyiBjyiC(29)\n=1p\n2nX\nx;y2Fn\n2jxiA(MT)yxjyiBjyiC (30)\n=\u0010\nIA\n\u0010dMT\u0011\nBC\u0011\njGHZniABC: (31)\nThis completes the proof and establishes the identity.\nAs our next result, we prove some properties of the GHZ-map deﬁned in the above lemma.\nLemma 5. The GHZ-map M2C2n\u00022n7!cM2C22n\u000222nin Lemma 4 is an algebra homomorphism [25]:\n(a)Linear: IfM=\u000BA+\fB, where\u000B;\f2C, thencM=\u000BbA+\fbB.\n(b)Multiplicative: If M=AB, thencM=bAbB.\n(c)Projector-preserving: If Mis a projector, then cMis also a projector.\nProof: We prove these properties via the deﬁnition of the mapping.\n(a) SinceMxy=hxjMjyi=\u000BhxjAjyi+\fhxjBjyi=\u000BAxy+\fBxy, the property follows.\n(b) We observe that\nbAbB=X\nx;y2Fn\n2Axyjx;xihy;yj\u0001X\nx0;y02Fn\n2Bx0y0jx0;x0ihy0;y0j (32)\n=X\nx;y02Fn\n22\n4X\ny2Fn\n2AxyByy03\n5jx\nAbB=X\nx;y2Fn\n2Axyjx;xihy;yj\u0001X\nx0;y02Fn\n2Bx0y0jx0;x0ihy0;y0j (32)\n=X\nx;y02Fn\n22\n4X\ny2Fn\n2AxyByy03\n5jx;xihy0;y0j (33)\n=X\nx;y02Fn\n2(AB)xy0jx;xihy0;y0j (34)\n=dAB=cM: (35)\n(c) This simply follows from the multiplicative property via the special case A=B=M.\nThis completes the proof and establishes the said properties of the GHZ-map.\nWe are interested in performing stabilizer measurements at Alice and deducing the effect on Bob’s and Charlie’s qubits. The\nabove properties greatly simplify the analysis, given that the code projector for a stabilizer code (6) is a product of sums. Due\nto the multiplicativity of the GHZ-map M7!cM, we only have to analyze the case where Alice’s code has a single stabilizer\ngenerator\"E(a;b), i.e., her code projector is simply M=IN+\"E(a;b)\n2, whereN= 2n. Now, using linearity, we just need to\ndeterminecINand\\E(a;b). Then, due to Lemma 1(a), we havedMT=1\n2\u0010\ncIN+ (\u00001)abT\\E(a;b)\u0011\n.\nTheorem 6. Givenncopies of the GHZ state shared between Alice, Bob and Charlie, measuring E(a;b)on Alice’snqubits\nand obtaining the result \"2f\u0006 1gis equivalent to measuring the following with results +1on the qubits of Bob and Charlie:\n\"E(a;b)T\nB\nE(a;0)C=\"(\u00001)abTE(a;b)B\nE(a;0)CandfZBiZCi=E(0;ei)B\nE(0;ei)C;i= 1;2;:::;ng;\nwhereZBi(resp.ZCi) refers toZoni-th qubit of Bob (resp. Charlie), and eiis the zero vector with a 1ini-th position.\nProof: See Appendix B.11\nExample 3. Considern= 1 and the case when Alice applies M=I+Z\n2=I+E(0;1)\n2, witha= 0;b= 1. ThenbI=I\nI+Z\nZ\n2\nand\\E(0;1)T= (E(0;1)T\nE(0;0))\u0001bI= (Z\nI)\u0001bI. Therefore, the stabilizers for BC are hZ\nI;Z\nZi.\nIf we had an X-measurement for Alice, where a= 1;b= 0, thenE(a;b)T\nE(a;0) =X\nX. Combined with the Z\nZ\nfrombI, the qubits on BC are projected to the Bell state.\nMore interestingly, if we consider a Y-measurement for Alice, where a=b= 1, thenE(a;b)T\nE(a;0) =YT\nX=\n\u0000Y\nX. Thus, assuming the measurement result is +1, the new BC stabilizers are h\u0000Y\nX;Z\nZi. It can be veriﬁed that\nthe post-measurement state for this case will be(\nstabilizers are h\u0000Y\nX;Z\nZi. It can be veriﬁed that\nthe post-measurement state for this case will be(j0i+{j1i)p\n2\n(j00i\u0000{j11i)p\n2, which is stabilized by the above stabilizer.\nTheorem 7. Givenncopies of the GHZ state, assume that Alice has applied some matrix to her qubits. Then, Bob applying\nanother matrix Wto his qubits is equivalent to Charlie applying Wto his qubits and then exchanging his qubits with Bob.\nProof: Consider two arbitrary matrices M=P\nx;y2Fn\n2MxyjxihyjandW=P\nu;v2Fn\n2Wuvjuihvj. Then, we have\nWBMAjGHZni=WBX\nx;y2Fn\n2MxyjxihyjA\u00011p\n2nX\nz2Fn\n2jziAjziBjziC(36)\n=1p\n2nX\nu;v2Fn\n2WuvjuihvjB\u0001X\nx;z2Fn\n2MxzjxiAjziBjziC(37)\n=1p\n2nX\nu;x;z2Fn\n2MxzjxiAWuzjuiBjziC: (38)\nSimilarly, we have\nSwapBCWCMAjGHZni=SwapBCX\nu;v2Fn\n2WuvjuihvjC\u00011p\n2nX\nx;z2Fn\n2MxzjxiAjziBjziC(39)\n=SwapBC1p\n2nX\nu;x;z2Fn\n2MxzjxiAjziBWuzjuiC(40)\n=1p\n2nX\nu;x;z2Fn\n2MxzjxiAWuzjuiBjziC(41)\n=WBMAjGHZni: (42)\nThis proves the identity.\nNote that this is result is non-trivial — while Charlie can obviously obtain Bob’s qubits initially, apply W, and then return\nthem to Bob, the identity shows that Charlie can apply Wto his qubits and then exchange them with Bob. While our GHZ\ndistillation protocol does not utilize this property, we state it here since it might be useful in other settings.\nB. GHZ Distillation using a 3-Qubit Code\nWe now have all the tools to investigate a stabilizer code based GHZ distillation protocol that generalizes the Bell pair\ndistillation protocol discussed in Section III. Let us consider the 3-qubit code with stabilizers S=hYYI;IYYito understand\nthe subtleties in the steps of the protocol. First, similar to the Bell pair scenario, we have the following stabilizer group for 3\ncopies of the GHZ state:\nG3=hZAiZBiICi; IAiZBiZCi; X AiXBiXCi;i= 1;2;3i (43)\n=hE([0A;0B;0C];[eA\ni;eB\ni;0C]); E([0A;0B;0C];[0A;eB\ni;eC\ni]); E([eA\ni;eB\ni;eC\ni];[0A;0B;0C]) ;i= 1;2;3i (44)\n=hE([0A;0B;0C];[eA\ni;eB\ni;0C]); E([0A;0B;0C];[0A;eB\ni;eC\ni]);\u0000E([eA\ni;eB\ni;eC\ni];[eA\ni;eB\ni;0C]) ;i= 1;2;3i (45)\n=hZAiZBiICi; IAiZB\n E([0A;0B;0C];[0A;eB\ni;eC\ni]);\u0000E([eA\ni;eB\ni;eC\ni];[eA\ni;eB\ni;0C]) ;i= 1;2;3i (45)\n=hZAiZBiICi; IAiZBiZCi;\u0000YAiYBiXCi;i= 1;2;3i: (46)\nFor some codes, it is convenient to work with the stabilizer \u0000YYX (or other combinations of the generators in (43)) rather\nthanXXX , so we have shown this in the last equality.\nThe steps of the protocol, with this particular [ [3;1;1] ]code as an example, are shown in Table II. Again, we use the stabilizer\nformalism for measurements from Section II-C. We will explain each step below and discuss the potential subtleties that can\narise. It could be useful to imagine the three parties as being three nodes A — B — C on a linear network chain. For other\nnetwork topologies, the protocol can be modiﬁed appropriately, as we discuss later in Section IV-E.\n(0) Alice locally prepares 3copies of the perfect GHZ state and groups her qubits together for further processing. She keeps\naside the grouped qubits of Bob’s and Charlie’s but does not send those to them yet. She also writes down the parity\ncheck matrix for the 9qubits, based on only GHZ stabilizers, along with signs, as shown in Step (0) of Table II.12\nTABLE II: Steps of the GHZ distillation protocol based on the [ [3;1;1] ]code deﬁned by S=hYYI;IYYi.

Each of the nGHZ states initially prepared\nby Alice has a qubit marked ‘A’, a qubit marked ‘B’, and a qubit marked ‘C’. The channel is assumed to introduce Pauli\nerrors. Both classical communications are noiseless and involve the communication of stabilizers, syndrome, and logical Pauli\noperators. The block UCrepresents Bob’s application of an appropriate diagonal Clifford unitary on qubits ‘C’, as prescribed\nin Appendix C. The recovery blocks RBCandRCrepresent Pauli corrections applied by Bob on qubits ‘BC’ (B and C) and\nby Charlie on qubits ‘C’ respectively. The decoding blocks represent (locally) inverting the respective encoding unitaries of\nthe codes of Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and this step can be asynchronous (unlike what the picture may suggest).\n(1) Alice measures the stabilizer YA1YA2IA3=E([(e1+e2)A;0B;0C];[(e1+e2)A;0B;0C])and the groupG3gets updated\nas shown in Step (1) of Table II, assuming that the measurement result is \"A\n12f\u0006 1g. Based on the stabilizer formalism\n(Section II-C), the measured stabilizer replaces the ﬁrst row (as indicated by the left arrow) and the second row is\nmultiplied with the previous ﬁrst row. For visual clarity, code stabilizer rows are boldfaced and binary vectors are written\nout in full. Furthermore, as per Theorem 6, this measurement of E(e1+e2;e1+e2)by Alice should imply that\n\"A\n1E(e1+e2;e1+e2)T\nB\nE(e1+e2;0)C=\"A\n1E(e1+e2;e1+e2)B\nE(e1+e2;0)C\nautomatically belongs to the (new) stabilizer group. Indeed, this element can be produced by multiplying the ele\ny belongs to the (new) stabilizer group. Indeed, this element can be produced by multiplying the elements\n\u0000E([eA\ni;eB\ni;eC\ni];[eA\ni;eB\ni;0C])fori= 1;2along withYA1YA2IA3=E([(e1+e2)A;0B;0C];[(e1+e2)A;0B;0C])using\nLemma 1(b). This is exactly how the seventh row gets updated.\n(2) Alice measures the second stabilizer IA1YA2YA3=E([(e2+e3)A;0B;0C];[(e2+e3)A;0B;0C])and the group gets updated\nas shown in Step (2) of Table II. The procedure is very similar to that in Step (1).\nSince Alice has measured all her stabilizer generators, and the stabilizer formalism preserves the commutativity of the\nelements in the group, the third row in the ﬁrst block of 3 rows must necessarily commute with Alice’s stabilizers. Thus,\nthe Alice component of the third row must form a logical operator for Alice’s code, and we deﬁne it to be the logical\nZoperator, i.e., ZA=ZZZ =E(0;e1+e2+e3). We will see shortly that Bob’s qubits get the same code (possibly\nwith sign changes for the stabilizers), so this third row can be written as the logical GHZ stabilizer ZAZBIC.\nThis phenomenon also generalizes to any [ [n;k;d ] ]stabilizer code, with some caveats when the code has some purely\nZ-type stabilizers, and we determine the logical Zoperators either after Alice’s set of measurements or apriori using\nsome linear algebraic arguments (see Appendix C-B for details). Note that it is convenient to choose the logical Z\noperators such that they respect the GHZ structure of our analysis, e.g., Z=IIY will not be compatible here.\n(3) If we consider the parity-check matrix after Step (2), we see that rows 4 through 8 are the stabilizers promised by\nTheorem 6 that act only on B and C systems. However, due to the same result, the C parts of rows 7 and 8 only have\nX-s instead of Y-s. So, to change them back to Y-s, Alice applies the inverse of the Phase (i.e.,p\nZ) gate to all 3\nqubits of the C system. She speciﬁcally applies the inverse, rather thanp\nZitself, to get rid of the \u00001sign for the last row.\nFor a general \napplies the inverse, rather thanp\nZitself, to get rid of the \u00001sign for the last row.\nFor a general stabilizer code, the appropriate diagonal Clifford must be chosen as discussed in Appendix C-A.

Since the Clifford is guaranteed to\nbe diagonal, it leaves purely Z-type stabilizers unchanged. Later, in Section IV-C, we show that it is better for Bob to\nperform this Clifford on Charlie’s qubits, rather than Alice.\nThough we have used the \u0000YYX GHZ stabilizer here for convenience, for a general code we can simply continue\nto useXXX . After Alice has measured her stabilizer generators, this last block of 3 rows could have changed but\nthey still commute with the generators. Since the middle block never gets affected by Alice’s measurements, we can\nguarantee using Theorem 6 that two of the last 3 rows must be the joint BC stabilizers induced by Alice’s two generators.\nHence, the remaining row’s Alice component must form a logical operator for Alice’s code, and will be distinct from the\npreviously deﬁned logical Zoperator. We deﬁne this to be the logical Xoperator, i.e., XA=IIY =Y3=E(e3;e3).\nAs we will see shortly, both Bob and Charlie get the same code, so this last row of the third block can be written as\nthe logical GHZ stabilizer XAXBXC. The generalization to arbitrary stabilizer codes is discussed in Appendix C-B.\nThen, she sends Bob both his qubits as well as C\nrary stabilizer codes is discussed in Appendix C-B.\nThen, she sends Bob both his qubits as well as Charlie’s qubits over a noisy Pauli channel, which introduces the signs\n\u0011;\u0017i;\u0016i2f\u0006 1g;i= 1;2;3. She also classically communicates the code stabilizers, her syndromes f\"A\n1;\"A\n2g, and the\nlogicalZandXoperators to him.\n(4) Now, based on Alice’s classical communication, Bob applies Theorem 6 to obtain the stabilizer generators\n\"A\n1(YB1YB2IB3) (YC1YC2IC3) =\"A\n1E(e1+e2;e1+e2)T\nB\nE(e1+e2;e1+e2)C;\n\"A\n2(IB1YB2YB3) (IC1YC2YC3) =\"A\n2E(e2+e3;e2+e3)T\nB\nE(e2+e3;e2+e3)C\nfor the induced joint code on his as well as Charlie’s qubits.

He measures these 5stabilizers to deduce and correct the error introduced by the channel on the 6qubits\nsent by Alice. Assuming perfect error correction, the signs will be back to the ones in Alice’s ﬁnal parity-check matrix.\nWhen Bob sends Charlie’s qubits to him, the channel might introduce errors on those 3qubits. To deduce and correct\nthese errors, there must have been a code induced on Charlie’s qubits even befo\no deduce and correct\nthese errors, there must have been a code induced on Charlie’s qubits even before the transmission . Hence, after correcting\nerrors on the 6qubits of BC systems, Bob measures the same stabilizers as Alice’s code but on his qubits. This produces\nrows 4and5in Step (4) of Table II, and row 6gets updated as per the stabilizer formalism. When looking at rows 7\nand8of Step (3), it is evident that one can correspondingly multiply them with these new rows 4and5to produce the\nsame code just on Charlie’s qubits.\nThis phenomenon extends to general stabilizer codes as well, where the joint stabilizers \"A\ni(\u00001)aibT\niE(ai;bi)B\nE(ai;bi)C\nare multiplied with Bob’s stabilizers \"B\niE(ai;bi)Bto obtain Charlie’s stabilizers \"A\ni\"B\ni(\u00001)aibT\niE(ai;bi)C(see Algo-\nrithm 2). Any purely Z-type stabilizer directly carries over to Charlie (without the above argument) as follows. At the\nbeginning of the protocol, we can rewrite the E([0A;0B;0C];[eA\ni;eB\ni;0C])rows such that a subset of them correspond to\nE([0A;0B;0C];[zA;zB;0C]), whereE(0;z)-s are the purely Z-type stabilizer generators of the code. This subset of rows\nwill never be replaced by stabilizer measurements since they commute with other stabilizers. After Alice’s measurements,\nthere will be rows corresponding to \"A\nzE(0;z)A, which can be multiplied respectively with the aforesaid subset of rows\nto obtain\"A\nzE(0;z)B. Just like we rewrote a subset of the ﬁrst nrows, we can rewrite a subset of the second nrows to\nobtainE([0A;0B;0C];[0A;zB;zC]), which when multiplied with \"A\nzE(0;z)Bproduces the desired \"A\nzE(0;z)Cfor Charlie’s\ncode. See Appendix C-B for some related discussion. In order to merge this phenomenon for purely Z-type operators\nwith the general signs \"A\ni\"B\ni(\u00001)aibT\nifor Charlie, we set \"B\ni:= +1 wheneverai= 0, as mentioned in Algorithm 2.\nNow, Bob has the parity-check matrix shown in Step (4) but without the new signs \f;\u000B 1;\u000B2;\u000B3, which will be introduced\nby the channel during transmission of Charlie’s\n the new signs \f;\u000B 1;\u000B2;\u000B3, which will be introduced\nby the channel during transmission of Charlie’s qubits. He sends Charlie his qubits (over a noisy Pauli channel), the\ncode stabilizer generators, along with the corresponding signs f\"A\n1\"B\n1;\"A\n2\"B\n2g, and the logical ZandXoperators.\nFinally, Charlie measures these generators and ﬁxes errors based on discrepancies in signs with respect to f\"A\n1\"B\n1;\"A\n2\"B\n2g(the\nadditional signs (\u00001)aibT\nido not make a difference for this example). In the matrix in Step (4) of Table II, after excluding\nthe three sets of code stabilizers, we see that there are 3rows left which exactly correspond to the logical GHZ stabilizers,\nwhere we have deﬁned the logical operators Z=ZZZ;X=IIY =Y3for the code. Therefore, we have shown that after all\nsteps of the protocol, the logical qubits of A, B, and C are in the GHZ state. Since the signs of the stabilizer generators can\nbe different for each of the three parties, although their logical XandZoperators are the same, the encoding unitary can be\nslightly different. If they each perform the inverse of their respective encoding unitaries on their qubits (called “Decoding” in\nFigure 2), then the logical GHZ state is converted into a physical GHZ state.\nIt might seem like this last step requires coordination among all three of them, which would require two-way communications\nbetween parties. However, this is not necessary as Alice can perform the unitary on her qubits once she sends the 6qubits\nto Bob, and Bob can perform the unitary on his qubits once he sends the 3qubits to Charlie. Subsequent operations will\nnecessarily commute with these local unitaries as those qubits are not touched by the remaining parties in the protocol.\nHence, we have illustrated a complete GHZ distillation protocol, although much care must be taken while executing the steps\nfor an arbitrary code. For example, the local Clifford on C must be determined by solving a set of linear equations and ﬁnding\na binary symmetric ma\nifford on C must be determined by solving a set of linear equations and ﬁnding\na binary symmetric matrix that speciﬁes the diagonal Clifford, via the connection to binary symplectic matrices [32], [33].\nThis is discussed in detail in Appendix C-A. Similarly, the logical operators of the code that are compatible with our analysis\nof the protocol must be determined by simulating Alice’s part of the protocol and applying some linear algebraic arguments.\nFor a general [ [n;k;d ] ]code, there will be 3knon-code-stabilizer rows at the end, and one needs to identify kpairs of logical\nXandZoperators for the code from these rows. Although any valid deﬁnition of logical Paulis would likely sufﬁce, we use\nAlgorithm 3 to deﬁne them so that they naturally ﬁt our analysis. The explanations for the steps involved in this algorithm are\ngiven in Appendix C-B. In order to keep the main paper accessible, we have moved the discussion on implementation details\nto Appendix C.\nC. Placement of Local Clifford and Distillation Performance\nIn our description of the protocol above, we mentioned that Alice performs the local Clifford\u0010p\nZy\u0011\n3\non the qubits of\nsystem C in order to make Charlie’s code the same as Alice’s and Bob’s. However, due to this operation, the joint BC code\n(in Step (4)) cannot distinguish between Bob’s qubits and Charlie’s qubits. Indeed, consider the two-qubit operator XB1XC1.\nThis commutes with all 5stabilizer generators of this code, although just XB1or justXC1would have anticommuted with the\nﬁrst generator (YB1YB2IB3) (YC1YC2IC3). Therefore, if the true error is XC1, then the maximum likelihood decoder will correct\nit withXB1, which results in a logical error. Of course, the 3-qubit code only has distance 1, but even if we consider the17\nFig. 3: Performance of variations of the GHZ distillation protocol using the [ [5;1;3] ]perfect code, and comparison with the\nstandard QEC performance of the same code on the depolarizing channel. The decoder employs a maximum likeliho\nQEC performance of the same code on the depolarizing channel. The decoder employs a maximum likelihood decoding\nscheme that identiﬁes a minimal weight error pattern matching the syndrome.\nsame 5-qubit code as in Section III, the above phenomenon will still occur. In effect, the induced joint BC code has distance\ndropping to 2whenever Alice’s code does not have any purely Z-type stabilizer. If we do not perform the diagonal Clifford\nat all, then in such cases Charlie’s code will have only distance 1.\nTo mitigate this, we can instead make Bob perform the same diagonal Clifford operation on Charlie’s qubits. This ensures\nthat the stabilizers for the BC code induced by Alice’s code are of the form E(a;b)B\nE(a;0)C, or justE(0;b)Bwhenever\nthe stabilizer is purely Z-type. If Alice’s code has good distance properties, then this joint BC code will have at least that\nmuch protection for Bob’s qubits. Although the C parts of the stabilizers are purely X-type, the additional GHZ stabilizers\nZBiZCihelp in detecting X-errors on system C as well. Alternatively, one could make Alice perform one type of diagonal\nClifford and Bob perform another diagonal Clifford, both on system C, to make both the BC code as well as Charlie’s code\nas good as possible. In future work, we will investigate these interesting degrees of freedom.\nWe developed a MATLAB simulation of this protocol2and tested it using the [ [5;1;3] ]perfect code deﬁned by S=\nhXZZXI; IXZZX; XIXZZ; ZXIXZ i. The result is shown as the green curve marked ‘purely X code for C’ in Fig. 3.\nWhen compared to the standard QEC performance of this code on the depolarizing channel, we see that the exponent is\nworse. This is because, by the arguments above, all non-purely Z-type stabilizers of Q(S)get converted into a purely X-type\nstabilizer for Charlie’s code. To mitigate this, we make Alice perform a local diagonal Clifford operation on qubits C to\ntransformE(ai;0)CintoE(ai;bi)Clater. The performance of this is shown as the solid blue \nqubits C to\ntransformE(ai;0)CintoE(ai;bi)Clater. The performance of this is shown as the solid blue curve marked ‘same code for all’,\nwhich is equally worse. This time the reason is that the BC code Q(S0)has stabilizers of the form E(ai;bi)B\nE(ai;bi)C,\nwhich means that the code cannot distinguish the i-th qubit of B and the i-th qubit of C. Finally, we make Bob perform the\naforesaid diagonal Clifford on qubits C, and this produces the solid dark red curve marked ‘local Clifford by B’. Clearly, the\nexponent now approaches the “fundamental limit” set by standard QEC on the depolarizing channel.\nD. Output Fidelity of the Protocol\nDuring the protocol, if error correction at Bob and/or Charlie miscorrects and introduces a logical error, then the ﬁnal effect\nis a change in the signs of some of the logical GHZ stabilizers. This in turn means that after the decoding step, some of the k\ntriples will be the standard GHZ state corrupted by an unknown Pauli operation. Hence, the output of the protocol is correct\nwith probability (1\u0000Pf), and produces at least one Pauli corrupted GHZ state with probability Pf, using the notation in\nFig. 3. To make this precise, denote by jGHZ 0i;jGHZ 1i;:::;jGHZ 7ithe eight possible variants of the GHZ state under Pauli\n2Implementation available online: https://github.com/nrenga/ghz_distillation_qec18\noperations, i.e., each variant has the stabilizer group h\u000B1ZZI; \u000B 2IZZ; \u000B 3XXXiwith\u000B1;\u000B2;\u000B32f\u0006 1g. Then, assuming\nall variants are equally likely conditioned on a failure event, the density matrix representing the output of the protocol is\n\u001Aout= (1\u0000Pf)jGHZ 00\u0001\u0001\u00010ihGHZ 00\u0001\u0001\u00010j+Pf8k\u00001X\ni=11\n8k\u00001jGHZi1i2\u0001\u0001\u0001ikihGHZi1i2\u0001\u0001\u0001ikj; (47)\nwherejGHZ 00\u0001\u0001\u00010ihGHZ 00\u0001\u0001\u00010j=jGHZihGHZj\nk,(i1i2\u0001\u0001\u0001ik)is the base- 8expansion of i, andjGHZi1i2\u0001\u0001\u0001ikihGHZi1i2\u0001\u0001\u0001ikj=\njGHZi1ihGHZi1j\njGHZi2ihGHZi2j\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\nj GHZikihGHZikj.\nSimilar to the case of triorthogonal codes in magic state distillation [34], it is likely useful to consider the reduced density\nmatrix for one of the koutput t\nstillation [34], it is likely useful to consider the reduced density\nmatrix for one of the koutput triples, and relate its ﬁdelity (with respect to jGHZihGHZj) to properties of the code and decoder.\nIn Ref. [34], the authors adopted exactly such a strategy for distillation of T-states, under a purely Z-error model and relying\non post-selection where non-trivial syndromes are discarded. In recent work [35], it has been shown that performing error\ncorrection rather than just detection (and post-selection) leads to better performance of triorthogonal codes. For our scenario\nof GHZ distillation, it is an interesting problem to construct codes and decoders for this protocol where we can relate the\noutput ﬁdelity to code properties and arrive at analytical scaling arguments with increasing code size. This would be useful for\ncomparing with fundamental limits of entanglement distillation [6] and assessing the optimality of this protocol. In particular,\nby employing the recent exciting classes of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes that have linearly scaling rate\nand almost linearly scaling distance with code length [12]–[15], and using efﬁcient iterative decoders such as belief-propagation\n(BP) [36], [37], one can hope to achieve high-rate high-output-ﬁdelity GHZ distillation schemes.\nE. Variations of the GHZ Protocol\nIn the GHZ protocol we have discussed so far, Alice starts by preparing nGHZ states and measuring the n-qubit stabilizers\nof her code on qubits A. Then, using Theorem 6, Bob proceeds by measuring the 2n-qubit stabilizers of the code induced on\nqubits B and C by Alice’s choice of code on qubits A. Subsequently, he also measures the same n-qubit stabilizers as Alice\nbut on qubits B, so that there is a code induced just on qubits C and Charlie can use that code to correct errors from the\nchannel. If we imagine the three parties being on a linear network topology, then this protocol seems reasonable since each\nparty retains his/her qubits and passes on\n topology, then this protocol seems reasonable since each\nparty retains his/her qubits and passes on all remaining qubits to the next hop in the chain. However, there is an asymmetry\nin the operations since Bob needs to perform two rounds of measurements and one involves twice the number of qubits.\nTo address this, the protocol can be modiﬁed so that Alice starts by measuring qubits A and qubits B separately. Though\nthis does not circumvent the issue of performing twice the number of measurements at one of the nodes, this avoids the need\nof2n-qubit measurements. Of course, when Alice measures f\"iE(ai;bi)gqubits A, Theorem 6 still dictates that there is a\n2n-qubit codef\"iE(ai;bi)T\nB\nE(ai;0)Cgjointly on qubits B and C. But, when she measures the same stabilizers f\"iE(ai;bi)g\non qubits B, one can multiply with the corresponding 2n-qubit stabilizer to see that the joint stabilizers can be broken into\npurely B and purely C stabilizers. Therefore, once Alice performs the two rounds of measurements, she can send qubits B to\nBob and qubits C to Charlie, along with the necessary classical information. As individual codes have been induced separately\non qubits B and qubits C, Bob and Charlie can still perform local n-qubit measurements to ﬁx errors during qubit transmission.\nFinally, this scheme suits other network topologies such as an isosceles one where the distance from A to B and A to C are\nroughly the same. Since this variation relies on the same intuitions from Theorem 6, we do not elaborate further. We also note\nthat there can be further variations based on other practical considerations.\nV. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we began by describing the Bell pair distillation protocol introduced in Ref. [7], and used the stabilizer\nformalism to understand its working. We identiﬁed that the Bell state matrix identity (Section II-D) plays a critical role in\nthat protocol. As our ﬁrst result, we proved the equivalent matrix identity for GHZ states, where we introdu\ntocol. As our ﬁrst result, we proved the equivalent matrix identity for GHZ states, where we introduced the GHZ-map\nand showed that it is an algebra homomorphism. Using the GHZ-map, we proved our main result (Theorem 6) that describes\nthe effect of Alice’s stabilizer measurements (on qubits A) on qubits B and qubits C. Then, we constructed a complete GHZ\ndistillation protocol whose steps were guided by the aforementioned main result. We demonstrated that the placement of a\ncertain local Clifford on qubits C in the protocol has an immense effect on the performance of the protocol. We described the\nrelation between the probability of failure of the protocol and the output ﬁdelity of the GHZ states. As part of our protocol,\nwe also developed a new algorithm to generate logical Pauli operators for an arbitrary stabilizer code.\nIt will be interesting to investigate codes and decoders where the output ﬁdelity can be analytically related to code properties.\nThe presence of the local Clifford in the protocol introduces a non-trivial degree of freedom where there is scope for\noptimization. In future work, we will combine this degree of freedom with other optimization methods that consider noisy\nlocal operations at each node [9]. We will also extend our methods to t-qubit GHZ for t\u003E3and investigate if the size and\nnumber of rounds of measurements at each node can be bounded independent of t, since that will be practically attractive.19\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Kaushik Seshadreesan and Saikat Guha for helpful discussions, and Mark Wilde for describing\nhis protocol in our quantum error correction meeting.

We take a meet-in-the-middle approac\nmeasurements, the induced logical state is that of kBell pairs. We take a meet-in-the-middle approach where we ﬁrst consider\nkBell pairs and show how their encoded state looks like, and then we project nBell pairs to prove that the resulting state is\nthe same as the aforesaid encoded state.\nLetC1;C2be two binary linear codes such that C2\u001AC1. For the [ [n;k] ]CSS code deﬁned by these codes, C2produces the\nX-stabilizers,C1produces the logical Xoperators,C?\n1produces the Z-stabilizers, andC?\n2produces the logical Zoperators.\nLetGC1=C2denote a generator matrix for the quotient group C1=C2that represents the “pure” logical Xoperators that do not\nhave anyX-stabilizer component. In other words, the rows of GC1=C2give the generators of logical Xoperators for the CSS\ncode. LetUEncdenote an encoding unitary for the code.

By the Bell\nstate matrix identity (Section II-D), this means that we are effectively simultaneously applying \u0005T\nCSS= \u0005 CSSon Bob’s qubits\nas well. Here, the transpose has no effect because the stabilizer generators for CSS codes are purely X-type or purely Z-type,\nand only such operators appear in the expression for the code projector (6). Let G2andG?\n1represent generator matrices for\nthe codesC2andC?\n1, respectively. Then, we have\n\u0005CSS=Y\nu2rows(G2)IN+E(u;0)\n2\u0001Y\nv2rows(G?\n1)IN+E(0;v)\n2=:\u0005X\u0001\u0005Z: (50)\nFor anyz2Fn\n2, sinceE(0;v)jzi= (\u00001)zvTjzi, we have (IN+E(0;v))jzi= 2jziifzvT= 0 and(IN+E(0;v))jzi= 0\notherwise.

Speciﬁcally, we discuss how\nto identify the appropriate diagonal Clifford to be applied on qubits C, and explain the reasoning behind Algorithm 3 that\ngenerates logical Pauli operators for any stabilizer code. The discussion related to Algorithm 3 will also clarify some aspects\nof the distillation protocol.\nA. Diagonal Clifford on qubits C\nA diagonal Clifford unitary on nqubits can be described using an n\u0002nbinary symmetric matrix Ras [32], [33]\nUR=X\nv2Fn\n2{vRvTmod 4jvihvj=diag\u0010\nf{vRvTmod 4gv2Fn\n2\u0011\n: (81)\nIts action on a Pauli matrix E(a;b)is given by [28], [33]\nURE(a;b)Uy\nR=E(a;b+aR) (82)\n=E(a;(b\baR) + 2(b\u0003aR)) (83)\n={2a(b\u0003aR)TE(a;b\baR) (84)\niven by [28], [33]\nURE(a;b)Uy\nR=E(a;b+aR) (82)\n=E(a;(b\baR) + 2(b\u0003aR)) (83)\n={2a(b\u0003aR)TE(a;b\baR) (84)\n= (\u00001)a(b\u0003aR)TE(a;b\baR); (85)\nwhereb\u0003aRis the entrywise product of the two binary vectors. It is well-known that any diagonal Clifford operator can be\nformed using the phase gate, P, and the controlled- Zgate, CZ, deﬁned as\nP=\u00141 0\n0{\u0015\n;CZ=\u0014I20\n0Z\u0015\n=2\n6641 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0\u000013\n775: (86)\nSetn= 2. Then, theRmatrices for P1= (P\nI);P2= (I\nP);and CZ are respectively\nRP1=\u0014\n1 0\n0 0\u0015\n;RP2=\u0014\n0 0\n0 1\u0015\n;andRCZ=\u0014\n0 1\n1 0\u0015\n:\nThis generalizes naturally to more than 2qubits. The diagonal entries of Rdescribe which qubits get acted upon by P, and\nthe pairwise off-diagonal entries describe which pairs of qubits get acted upon by CZ [33].\nIn our protocol, from Theorem 6 we observed that Alice’s stabilizers of the form E(ai;bi), withai6= 0, become the stabilizer\nE(ai;0)for Charlie. This also means that any logical Xoperator of the form E(cj;dj)would have transformed into E(cj;0)\n(e.g., see last row of Step (2) in Table II and compare it to the last row of Step (3)). Therefore, the purpose of the diagonal\nClifford on qubits C is to convert the stabilizers E(ai;0)back intoE(ai;bi)and the logical XoperatorsE(cj;0)back into23\nE(cj;dj). Given the above insight into diagonal Clifford operators, we want to ﬁnd a binary symmetric matrix Rsuch that\nURE(ai;0)Uy\nR=E(ai;bi)for alli= 1;2;:::;rX(using notation in Algorithm 3) and URE(cj;0)Uy\nR=E(cj;dj)for all\nj= 1;2;:::;k . Thus, we need a feasible solution RforfaiR=bi; i= 1;2;:::;rXgandfcjR=dj; j= 1;2;:::;kg.\nWe solve this system of linear equations on a binary symmetric matrix as follows. First, let Abe the matrix whose rows\narefaigandfcjg, and letBbe the matrix whose rows are fbigandfdjg. Then, we have the system AR=B. We recall the\nvectorization property of matrices, which implies that\nvec(QUV ) = (VT\nQ)vec(U): (87)\nHere, vectorization of a matrix is the operation of reading the matrix entries columnwise, top to bottom, and forming a ve\n a matrix is the operation of reading the matrix entries columnwise, top to bottom, and forming a vector\n(e.g., this is done through the command U(:) in MATLAB). Setting Q=A;U =R;V =I, we get (I\nA)vec(R) =vec(B),\nwhich is a standard linear algebra problem for the unknown vector vec (R). However, we desire a binary symmetric matrixR.\nWe impose this constraint as (I\u0000W)vec(R) = 0 , where 0denotes the all-zeros vector of length n2, andWis the permutation\nmatrix which transforms vec (Q)into vec (QT)for any matrix Q. In summary, we obtain the desired R(or equivalently the\ndiagonal Clifford UR) by solving\nﬁndRs.t. (I\nA)vec(R) =vec(B);\n(I\u0000W)vec(R) = 0: (88)\nSinceRis symmetric, it has n(n+ 1)=2degrees of freedom, which accounts for the second constraint. The matrix Ahas\nrX+k \u003C n rows and the Kronecker product with Iresults inn(rX+k)constraints on n(n+ 1)=2variables. It remains\nto be shown if there is always a feasible solution for any valid AandB. Note that [A;B]represents a matrix whose rows\nare stabilizers and logical Xoperators. This means any pair of rows must be orthogonal with respect to the symplectic inner\nproduct, which implies that ABT+BAT= 0. Thus, a given AandBis valid if and only if ABTis symmetric.\nB. Logical Paulis from GHZ Measurements\nThe procedure in Algorithm 3 to determine logical XandZgenerators of a stabilizer code is inspired by the stabilizer\nmeasurements on Bell or GHZ states, viewed through the lens of the stabilizer formalism for measurements (Section II-C).\nThough the algorithm could have been constructed just using measurements on Bell states, we preferred GHZ states because\nthere can be an additional non-trivial sign for the logical Xoperators due to an odd number of subsystems in the GHZ state.\nOf course, logical operators obtained using GHZ states will also apply to the Bell protocol since a negative sign on an even\nnumber of subsystems (A and B in Bell states) leads to an overall positive sign for XAXBandZAZB.\nWe have a codeQ(S)deﬁned by its \n in Bell states) leads to an overall positive sign for XAXBandZAZB.\nWe have a codeQ(S)deﬁned by its stabilizer group S=h\"iE(ai;bi) ;i= 1;2;:::;r =n\u0000ki. Deﬁne the r\u0002(2n+ 1)\nstabilizer (or parity-check) matrix H0whosei-th row is [ai;bi; \"i]. First, we bring the ﬁrst 2ncolumns of the stabilizer (or\nparity-check) matrix of the code to the following standard form:\nH1:2n=\u00140HZ\nH1H2\u0015\n: (89)\nHere, therZrows ofHZform all generators for the purely Z-type stabilizers of the code. The bottom part of the matrix\nis such that the rX\u0002nmatrixH1has full rank ( rX+rZ=r=n\u0000k). While performing row operations on the initial\nparity-check matrix H0, one has to account for the Pauli multiplication rule in Lemma 1(b), and not simply perform binary\nsums of (the ﬁrst 2ncolumns of the) rows, i.e., the last column of Hmust be updated to reﬂect changes in signs.\nNext, we simulate the creation of nGHZ states by creating a 2n\u0002(6n+ 1) GHZ stabilizer matrix SGHZ, whose ﬁrst nrows\nare[0;0;0; ei;ei;0;+1] and the second nrows are [ei;ei;ei;0;0;0;+1]. This matrix is the same as Step (0) of Table II,\nbut we have omitted the middle section since the measurements on subsystem Atrivially commute with entries IAZBZCof\nthis section. Now, we use the stabilizer formalism for measurements (Section II-C) to simulate measurements of the rows of\nHon subsystem A of SGHZ. Clearly, the stabilizers from [0;HZ]commute with the ﬁrst nrows, so these will only replace rZ\nrows in the bottom half of SGHZ. The stabilizers from [H1;H2]will necessarily anticommute with at least one of the ﬁrst n\nrows ofSGHZ, and theserXrows get replaced. This can be established by counting the dimension of purely Z-type operators\nwith which each row of [H1;H2]can commute, one after the other. Crucially, the stabilizer formalism guarantees that all rows\nof the evolved SGHZremain linearly independent and always commute.\nThe(n\u0000rX)non-replaced rows within the ﬁrst nrows can be divided into two types. Before we simulate any stabilizer\nmeasurements, th\nhin the ﬁrst nrows can be divided into two types. Before we simulate any stabilizer\nmeasurements, the ﬁrst nrows have standard basis vectors eifor theZ-parts of A and B. These can be rewritten such that\nwe haverZrows of the form [0;0;0; z;z; 0;+1], wherezcorresponds to rows of HZ, all of which are linearly independent\nby assumption of the standard form. Since these correspond to code stabilizers (on A as well as B), the measurement of\nrows of [H1;H2]will not replace these. After the measurements, when rZrows in the bottom half have been replaced by\n[0;0;0; z;0;0; \"z], we can multiply with the corresponding rows of the top half, i.e., [0;0;0; z;z; 0;+1], to produce purely\nZ-type stabilizers on subsystem B, which later deﬁne Bob’s code. These Z-operators on B in the top half form the ﬁrst\ntype ofrZrows. The remaining (n\u0000rX)\u0000rZ=krows form the second type, and they have to form logical ZAjZBj,24\nforj= 1;2;:::;k , since they commute with all code stabilizers and the columns of subsystem C remain zero. Thus, the\nZ-component of subsystem A of these krows produce the logical Zgenerators of the code, and they always have sign +1.\nA similar argument applies to the bottom half of the evolved SGHZmatrix. The stabilizer measurements from HZreplace\nrZrows out of the nrows. The remaining (n\u0000rZ)rows can again be divided into two types. The ﬁrst type of rows give\noperators that can be rewritten as the BC stabilizers guaranteed by Theorem 6. Speciﬁcally, these can be identiﬁed by the\nfact that their A-parts will be linearly dependent on the A-parts of the other rows of the evolved SGHZmatrix. Indeed, this is\nhow one can cancel the A-parts of these rXrows to produce the rXBC stabilizers corresponding to [H1;H2]. The remaining\n(n\u0000rZ)\u0000rX=krows of the bottom half form the second type, and they have to form logical X0\nAjX0\nBj, forj= 1;2;:::;k ,\nsince they commute with all code stabilizers and are linearly independent from all other rows. The A-parts of these rows are\nused to deﬁne the log\nnd are linearly independent from all other rows. The A-parts of these rows are\nused to deﬁne the logical X0operators of the code. The primes on these logical operators indicate that they might not exactly\npair up with the corresponding logical Zoperators deﬁned earlier. This is because they are only guaranteed to be logical\noperators independent of the logical Zoperators, but not to be the appropriate pairs fXjgof the previously determined fZjg.\nOnce these pseudo logical Xoperators are determined, we can easily ﬁnd the necessary pairs for the logical Zoperators. Let\nthe logicalZoperators be E(0;fi);i= 1;2;:::;k , and let these pseudo logical Xoperators be \u0017jE(cj;dj);j= 1;2;:::;k .\nIf they are the correct pairs, then we would get h[0;fi];[cj;dj]is=\u000Eijfor alli;j2f1;2;:::;kg, where\u000Eij= 1 ifi=jand\n0otherwise. The symplectic inner product can be expressed as\nh[0;fi];[cj;dj]is= [0;fi] \n [cj;dj]T;where \n =\u00140In\nIn0\u0015\n:\nTherefore, if Fis the matrix whose rows are fiand[C;D]is the matrix whose rows are [cj;dj], then we need\n[0;F] \n [C;D]T=:T=Ik:\nIfT6=Ik, then we can simply pre-multiply the equation by T\u00001(mod 2) to achieve the desired result. In this case, we redeﬁne\nthe logicalZoperators to be given by the rows of T\u00001[0;F]. This completes the reasoning behind Algorithm 3....",

However,\nthey are impacted by short cycles, detri-\nmental graphical conﬁgurations known as\ntrappingsets(TSs)presentinacodegraph\nas well as symmetric degeneracy of errors.\nThese factors signiﬁcantly degrade the de-\ncoder decoding probability performance\nand cause so-called error ﬂoor. In this pa-\nper, we establish a systematic methodol-\nogy by which one can identify and clas-\nsify quantum trapping sets (QTSs) accord-\ning to their topological structure and de-\ncoder used. The conventional deﬁnition of\na TS from classical error correction is gen-\neralized to address the syndrome decod-\ning scenario for QLDPC codes. We show\nthat the knowledge of QTSs can be used\nto design better QLDPC codes and de-\ncoders. Frame error rate improvements of\ntwo orders of magnitude in the error ﬂoor\nregime are demonstrated for some practi-\ncal ﬁnite-length QLDPC codes without re-\nquiring any post-processing.\n1 Introduction\nQuantum low-density parity check (QLDPC)\ncodes are an important class of quantum er-\nror correction (QEC) [2, 3] codes that can re-\nalize scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers\n(FTQCs) with a ﬁnite multiplicative overhead\n[4]. In addition, they have ﬁnite asymptotic\nrates with non-zero fault-tolerant thresholds [5],\nand support low-complexity iterative decoding.\nNithin Raveendran: nithin@email.arizona.edu\nBane Vasić: vasic@ece.arizona.edu,\nA part of this paper was presented at the 2021 IEEE Inter-\nnational Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) [1].TheexistingQLDPCcodeliteratureprimarilyfo-\ncuses on constructing asymptotically good code\nfamilies with improved minimum distance scal-\ning with the block length and highe\notically good code\nfamilies with improved minimum distance scal-\ning with the block length and higher code rates,\nas well as on designing better iterative decoding\nalgorithms [6–12]. However, QLDPC codes im-\nplemented in practical QEC systems will be of\nﬁnite length and will exhibit performance degra-\ndation due to the failure of iterative decoders to\nconverge to a correct error pattern. This phe-\nnomenon speciﬁc to ﬁnite-length codes is well un-\nderstood in classical literature, but similar anal-\nysis for QLDPC codes and precise mathematical\ncharacterization requires further attention in the\nQEC literature [7, 13]. The convergence failure\nmanifests itself as an error ﬂoor of the decod-\ning probability of error [14] at low physical error\nrate levels – an operating regime for large-scale\nFTQCs – and is observed in all state-of-the-art\niterative message-passing decoders for QLDPC\ncodes such as belief propagation (BP), min-sum\nalgorithm (MSA) and their variants [15–17].\nA typical approach in QEC literature to reduce\nthe error ﬂoor of the above decoding algorithms\nis to couple them with ordered statistics decoding\n(OSD)and post-processing [15, 17]. However, al-\nthough exhibiting good performance, this tech-\nnique is too complex to implement in hardware\ndue to the high complexity of the OSD algorithm\n[18] which scales cubically with the code dimen-\nsion (see Eq. 4 in [19]). In contrast, the philos-\nophy of our approach and our ultimate goal is\nto develop message-passing decoders for QLDPC\ncodes that do not require a post-processing step\nto achieve strong error correction.\nIterative message-passing decoder operates on\na Tanner graph which is the graphical represen-\ntation of a parity check matrix of the underlying\ncode. Error ﬂoor is attributed to the presence\nof speciﬁc topologies of sub-graphs in the Tan-\nner graph, generically referred to as trapping sets\n(TSs) that are detrimental to iterative decoders.\nSince a trapping set depends both on the topol-\nAccepted in Quant\ndetrimental to iterative decoders.\nSince a trapping set depends both on the topol-\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 1arXiv:2012.15297v2  [cs.IT]  7 Oct 2021ogy of the sub-graph and on the decoder, one\nmust understand key diﬀerences of QEC, speciﬁ-\ncally QLDPC codes and decoding with respect to\nclassical error correction.\nThe ﬁrst diﬀerence comes as the fact that the\nstabilizer commutativity/symplectic inner prod-\nuct (SIP) requirement for the parity check matri-\nces introduces additional code construction con-\nstraints resulting in unavoidable cycles in the\nTanner graph. Furthermore, QLDPC codes are\nknown to be highly degenerate, i.e., their mini-\nmum distance is higher than the weight of their\nstabilizers. From the decoder perspective, this\nimplies that the decoders need to account for de-\ngenerate errors, which have no equivalent in clas-\nsical error correction. However, iterative algo-\nrithms based on BP are sub-optimal in the pres-\nence of cycles and, also, are not capable of cor-\nrectingalldegenerateerrors[13,20]. Anotherkey\ndiﬀerence from classical LDPC decoding stems\nfrom the inability to directly measure qubits for\nerror correction. Hence, the iterative message-\npassing algorithms used for decoding of QLDPC\ncodes are modiﬁed to only make use of the syn-\ndrome information to infer the error introduced\nby the channel. How the classical trapping sets\ndeﬁnition accommodates a syndrome-based de-\ncoder is not clearly understood. As we show,\ndegenerate errors having no classical analogy in-\ntroduces new failure conﬁgurations unique to the\nQLDPC codes. The approach presented in this\npaper accounts for these key diﬀerences and their\nimplications.\nFailure conﬁgurations of QLDPC codes are rel-\natively unknown when compared to the classical\ntrappingsetresearch. OnemajordrawbackofBP\nas pointed out in [21] is that the decoding abil-\nity of BP is typically limited by the row weight\nof the parity-check matrix due to the SIP co\n abil-\nity of BP is typically limited by the row weight\nof the parity-check matrix due to the SIP con-\nstraint and identiﬁes pseudo-codeword structures\nfor cycle codes. However, generalization from cy-\ncle codes to QLDPC codes is non-trivial.\nIn this paper, we deﬁne quantum trapping sets\n(QTSs) by investigating failure conﬁgurations for\nsyndrome based iterative message passing algo-\nrithms. The quantum trapping set formulation\nis modiﬁed to the syndrome decoding scenario\nfor QLDPC codes considering Pauli XandZer-\nrors separately. We identify QTSs of prominent\nQLDPC code families and show that the QTSs\nmust be analyzed in conjunction with the partic-ular iterative decoder used along with their loca-\ntion in the Tanner graph [22]. In the same ﬂavor\nas in classical LDPC codes where the knowledge\nof trapping sets has resulted in low-complexity\ndecoders surpassing the traditional BP decoder\n[23], in this paper, we demonstrate two prac-\ntical advantages of our quantum trapping set\nstudy: (i) ability to construct QLDPC codes de-\nvoid of such graphical conﬁgurations, and (ii)\nability to devise new decoding algorithms that\nescape from such graphical conﬁgurations with-\nout post-processing. The message update rules\nand scheduling strategies thus identiﬁed help to\nimprove the error ﬂoor performance.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section 2, we introduce QLDPC codes using\nthe stabilizer formalism reviewing some basic no-\ntations, and then discuss the syndrome decod-\ning problem and classical trapping sets. In Sec-\ntion 3, we analyze the diﬀerent failure conﬁgura-\ntions and the relation between trapping sets and\ndecoder-error correction properties. We also for-\nmally deﬁne quantum trapping sets and describe\nthe methodology used to identify those speciﬁ-\ncally for Calderbank, Shor, Steane (CSS) codes\n[24]. Trapping sets of some classes of CSS codes\nare analyzed in Section 4. Based on these anal-\nyses, we present simulation results that brieﬂy\nexplore two strat\nin Section 4. Based on these anal-\nyses, we present simulation results that brieﬂy\nexplore two strategies of code and decoder im-\nprovement. We explore CSS code constructions\nwithout some of the harmful conﬁgurations and\ncompare the performance of trapping set-aware\ndecoding strategies in Section 5 followed by con-\ncluding remarks and future research directions in\nSection 6.\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Stabilizer Formalism\nStabilizer codes, the quantum analog of classi-\ncal linear codes, are the most common type of\nQEC codes considered in both theory and prac-\ntice [25, 26]. An Jn,k,d Kquantum stabilizer code\nmapskqubit quantum state |φ/angbracketrightto an entan-\ngledn-qubit codeword |ψ/angbracketright(a unit vector in the\n2n-dimensional Hilbert space) and is deﬁned as\na2k-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space\nwhich is a common +1eigenspace of the sta-\nbilizer groupS.

Theweightw(P)of\na Pauli operator P∈Pnis the number of qubits\non which it applies a non-identity Pauli matrix.\nA QLDPC code is a stabilizer code with all stabi-\nlizer generators having low weight [2].

Each row in\nHbdenotes a stabilizer generator, and a pair of\ncorrespondingcolumnsin HXandHZrepresenta\nqubit. Equivalent to the commutativity relation\ndeﬁned for Pauli operators, the stabilizer genera-\ntors commute with each other based on the sym-\nplectic inner product (SIP) in their binary repre-\nsentation [25]. Any two rows p= (pX,pZ)and\nq= (qX,qZ)of/bracketleftBig\nHX|HZ/bracketrightBig\nmust satisfyp⊙q:=\nmod (pXqT\nZ+pZbT\nX,2) = 0. This leads to the\ncondition\nHXHT\nZ+HZHT\nX= 0, (2)\nwhere the right hand si\nmod (pXqT\nZ+pZbT\nX,2) = 0. This leads to the\ncondition\nHXHT\nZ+HZHT\nX= 0, (2)\nwhere the right hand side ( 0) is anm×mzero\nmatrix,Tdenotes the transpose of a matrix, and\noperations (addition and multiplication) are done\nmodulo-2. We will refer to Eq. (2)as the SIP\nconstraint.\n2.3 Decoding Problem\nFollowing the approach in [2], to assess perfor-\nmanceofbinarysyndromedecodingofCSScodes,\nit is suﬃcient to consider the two independent bi-\nnary symmetric channels (BSCs) rather than the\ndepolarizing channel, thus ignoring the correla-\ntion between bit ﬂip ( X) and phase ﬂip ( Z) errors.\nIn this case, the BSCs for XandZerrors have a\ncross-over probability of 2p/3, decoded using HZ\nandHX, respectively.\nLete= (eX,eZ)be the binary representation\nof a Pauli error acting on the nqubits. The cor-\nresponding syndrome is computed as\n\u001B= [\u001BX,\u001BZ]\n= [ mod ( HZ.eT\nX,2),mod (HX.eT\nZ,2)].\nAll-zero syndrome \u001B=¯0indicates that all the\nstabilizerscommutewiththeerrorpattern(unde-\ntectable error), whereas non-zero entries/ones in\n\u001Bindicate that some stabilizer generators anti-\ncommute with the error pattern (detectable er-\nror). A syndrome based decoder’s task is to es-\ntimate the error pattern ^ewhose syndrome ^\u001B\nmatches with the initial input syndrome \u001B. If\n^\u001B=\u001B, the estimated error pattern ^eis applied\nto reverse the error eintroduced by the channel.\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify.

An at-\ntractive property of CSS codes constructed from\ntwo classical codes C1andC2, whereC⊥\n2⊆C 1is\nthat the parity check matrix can be written in a\nseparable form: Hb=/bracketleftBigg\nHX0\n0HZ/bracketrightBigg\n. CSS-QLDPC\ncodes have a sparse matrix Hbwith the SIP con-\nstraint:HZ.HT\nX= 0.\nWe can perform error correction for the X\nandZerrors separately using HZandHXmatri-\nces, respectively. The corresponding input syn-\ndromes are obtained as \u001BX= mod (HZ.eT\nX,2)\nand\u001BZ= mod (HX.eT\nZ,2), respectively. For\nsimplicity going forward, we use H,Land\u001B,e\nfor the parity check matrix, logical generator ma-\ntrix, input syndrome, and channel error vector,\nrespectively.\nThe stabilizer generator matrix/parity check\nmatrixHisthebi-adjacencymatrixofabipartite\nTanner graph G= (V∪C,E), whereVrepre-\nsents the set of nqubit/variable nodes (VNs), C\nis the set of mstabilizer generators/check nodes\n(CNs) and Eis the set of edges between them.\nCNci∈Cand VNvj∈Vare neighbors if\nthere is an edge (vj,ci)∈Ebetween the nodes,\ncorresponding to the non-zero entry in the par-\nity check matrix Hci,vj= 1. Diagrammatically,\nTanner graphs are drawn with circles represent-\ning VNs, squares representing CNs, and solid-\nlines representing the edges. Let us denote theset of CNs connected to a VN vjbyN(vj), and\n|N(vj)|,where|·|denotes cardinality, is referred\nto as the degree of the VN vj. Similarly, we can\ndeﬁne the neighbor set and the degree of a CN\nciasN(ci)and|N(ci)|, respectively. A (γ,ρ)\nQLDPC code hav\nne the neighbor set and the degree of a CN\nciasN(ci)and|N(ci)|, respectively. A (γ,ρ)\nQLDPC code have a sparse stabilizer matrix with\nthe variable and stabilizer degree upper-bounded\nbyγandρrespectively. For a subset of VNs, say\nK⊆V,N(K)denotes the set of CN neighbors.\nThe induced sub-graph G(K)is the graph con-\ntaining the nodes K∪N(K)along with the edges\n{(x,y)∈F:x∈K,y∈N(K)}. The girth, g, of\nthe Tanner graph Gis the length of the shortest\ncycle inG. Denote the number of cycles of length\ng,g+2,...byχg,χg+2,..., respectively. If Ghas\nχg,χg+2,...cycles of length g,g+2,..., then the\ncycle enumerator series CYC (x) =/summationtext\nr≥0χrxrde-\nﬁnes the cycle proﬁle of G.\nThe goal of a syndrome-based iterative decoder\nDsis to output an error pattern that matches the\ninput syndrome. This is diﬀerent from the tra-\nditional iterative decoder Dthat uses the chan-\nnel information as initial likelihoods to recover\nthe codeword matching to an all-zero syndrome.\nStarting from an input syndrome \u001Band an all-\nzero error vector estimate, Dsperforms a ﬁnite\nnumber/lscriptmaxof iterations of decoding over the\nTanner graph. The messages are passed over the\nedges of the Tanner graph from check nodes to\ntheir neighboring variable nodes and vice versa\nat every iteration of message passing decoding.\nDecoder update rules and message alphabet size\ncan be of varying complexity ranging from the\nsimplest binary message passing algorithms such\nas Gallager-B [28] to ﬁnite alphabet iterative de-\ncoders [23], and MSA or BP using ﬂoating point\nmessages[2]. Also, scheduleofmessagepassingin\nDscan be implemented with a ﬂooding/parallel\nschedule or a layered/serial schedule. Trapping\nset analysis presented here is applicable for all\nsuch decoder implementations. We discuss a\ngeneric syndrome-based iterative decoder in Ap-\npendix A for completeness.

We re-\nfer to ˆe(/lscript)\nj/ˆσ(/lscript)\nias the value of the variable/check\nnodevj/ciat iteration /lscript≤/lscriptmax.

The iterative procedure is halted if\nsuccessfully matched or if /lscriptmaxnumber of itera-\ntions is reached. At the end of iterative decoding,\nthe syndrome decoding process is successful if the\nsyndromes are matched. Otherwise, the decoding\nis said to have failed.\n2.5 Classical Trapping Sets\nAclassicaltrappingsetexampleisshowninFig.1\nillustrating the failure of a classical iterative de-\ncoderDon a small sub-graph inside the Tanner\ngraph. Let us consider a simple binary message\npassing decoder - Gallager-B decoder which per-\nforms XOR operation at the check nodes and a\nmajority voting at the variable nodes. More pre-\ncisely, the outgoing check node message over an\nedge is computed as the XOR of extrinsic (all in-\ncoming messages except the edge for the message\nis updated) variable node messages. The outgo-\ning variable node message is the majority value\namong incoming extrinsic check node messages\nand the channel value. The messages passed over\ncorresponding edges are marked next to the di-\nrected arrows in the ﬁgure. All-zero transmitted\ncodeword has errors only on three variable nodes\n(v2,v4,v5- shaded circles•) as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe decoder is unable to converge to the all-zero\ncodeword. In fact, the decoder oscillates from\nthe error pattern ( v2,v4,v5) to (v1,v3) and back\nas its output during the decoding iterations, thus\nfailing to converge.\nA classical iterative d\nback\nas its output during the decoding iterations, thus\nfailing to converge.\nA classical iterative decoder is said to con-\nverge correctly if the decoder output word for any\n/lscript≤/lscriptmaxmatches to the transmitted codeword\nand fails to converge correctly otherwise.

Themessagespassedovercorrespond-\ning edges are marked next to the directed arrows.\nNote that even though the messages passed in\nFig. 3 are diﬀerent from that in Fig. 1 of the reg-\nular Gallager-B decoder, the syndrome decoder is\nalso unable to co\nt from that in Fig. 1 of the reg-\nular Gallager-B decoder, the syndrome decoder is\nalso unable to converge, and its output oscillates\nfrom the all-zero error pattern to errors in v2,v4,\nandv5and back. Hence, the (5,3)TS in Fig. 3 is\nclassiﬁed as a QTS for the syndrome decoder as\nwell.\nIn addition to classical-type TSs, iterative de-\ncoders on QLDPC codes fail for speciﬁc degener-\nateerrors.

In quantum decoding, we say error vec-\ntorseandfaredegenerate errors ife⊕fisasta-\nbilizer, which makes it equivalent to output any\noneofthedegenerateerrorsasthecandidateerror\npattern for matching the syndrome. However, in\nQLDPC codes whose minimum distance is higher\nthan their stabilizer weight, some degenerate er-\nrors can be detrimental to iterative decoding. A\nsymmetric topology of the stabilizer sub-graph\nthat contains degenerate error patterns eandf\nof equal weight will result in a decoding failure.\nWe will see more examples of such decoder failure\nwhen the iterative decoder attempts to converge\ntoerrorpatterns eandfsimultaneously, thusnot\nmatching the input syndrome. This failure can\nbe attributed to the symmetry of the both the\nstabilizer and the decoder message update rules.\nHence, such errors are referred to as symmetric\ndegenerate errors and corresponding sets of vari-\nable nodes as symmetric stabilizer trapping sets\nor just symmetric stabilizers, \nnding sets of vari-\nable nodes as symmetric stabilizer trapping sets\nor just symmetric stabilizers, for short. Although\ndegenerate errors are typically classiﬁed as harm-\nless for quantum decoding, from the above dis-\ncussion it follows that some (not all) degenerate\nerror patterns in a symmetric stabilizer are harm-\nful for iterative decoders.\nDeﬁnition 5 A symmetric stabilizer is a stabilizer\nwith the set of variable/qubit nodes, whose in-\nduced sub-graph has no odd-degree check nodes,\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify.

Surface codes are highly degen-\nerate, and symmetric stabilizers, for example as\nshown in Fig. 4(a), are ubiquitous in them.\nNow, we discuss how degenerate errors within\nthe symmetric stabilizer are harmful for iterative\ndecoders.

It is not diﬃcult to see that such “am-\nbiguity” happens for all decoders for which: (a)\nthe check and message update rules are symmet-\nric functions in incoming messages, and (b) in\nthe same iteration all variable/check nodes in the\ngraph apply in parallel the same variable/check\nupdate function, respectively. For example, dur-\ningtheiterationsoftheGallager-Bdecoder,every\nunsatisﬁed CN \u0004sends the binary message, one\nback to the VNs. Because of the symmetry, the\nVNs in both eandfreceive exactly the same\nmessages, thus converging to e⊕f, the symmet-\nric stabilizer.\nBased on the Deﬁnition 4, the set of VNs in-\nvolved in the symmetric stabilizer form a QTS\nand the sub-graph in Fig. 6(a) is a (10,0) TS\nby convention.

Each of such partition (distinct\nby their unsatisﬁed syndromes) contributes two\nerror patterns each to the decoder failure in the\nTS.\n3.2 Searching for Quantum Trapping Sets\nUsing the deﬁnition of a QTS, one can search\nfor small sub-graphs in the Tanner graph of\nthe QLDPC code to identify and enumerate the\nQTSs. There are eﬃcient algorithms for TS\nsearch widely used in classical literature [29, 30]\nto identify sub-graphs that are (a,b)TSs. Suchtechniques are utilized in the search for classical-\ntype TSs. Note that there can be more than one\nnon-isomorphic sub-graphs with the same (a,b)\nparameters. For example, a (5,3)TS can have\nnon-isomorphic sub-graphs as in Fig. 2(b) and\nFig. 3. Observe that they all have diﬀerent com-\nbinations of short cycles of length six, eight and\nten. Enumeration of cycles and their combina-\ntions also allows to ﬁnd harmful classical-type\nTSs in the QLDPC code. Unlike these classical-\ntype TSs, the search for symmetric stabilizer TSs\nrequiresadiﬀerentapproachofﬁndinglow-weight\ncodewordsub-graphs[31]withadditionalsymme-\ntry constraints. In the case of CSS codes, the HZ\neven-weight stabilizer generators are examples of\nsymmetric stabilizer TSs for iterative decoding\nover the Tanner graph of HXmatrix and vice-\nversa. After obtaining the list of relevant QTSs,\nwe can perform decoder simulation with an iter-\native decoderDsto verify their relative harmful-\nness. In the next section, we ﬁnd and enumerate\nQTSs in some prominent QLDPC code families\npresented in the literature. We also provide the\nharmfulness analysis of “dominant” QTSs present\nin these code families.\n4 Trapping Set Analysis of CSS codes\nA myriad QLDPC code families have been pro-\nposed over the years. They include the CSS-\nbased constructions (bicycle codes [2], hyper-\ngraph product (HP) codes [8] and their general-\nizations [15], expander codes [9]), non-CSS based\nQLDPC codes [32, 33] and quaternary \nheir general-\nizations [15], expander codes [9]), non-CSS based\nQLDPC codes [32, 33] and quaternary QLDPC\ncodes [34]. In this section, we analyze trapping\nsets of CSS based QLDPC codes, the generalized\nbicycle codes, and HP codes, in particular. Simi-\nlar analysis may be extended to the general class\nof stabilizer codes.\n4.1 Generalized bicycle codes\nBicycle codes [2] were generalized by Kovalev and\nPryadko in [35] as follows: Consider two binary\nn/2×n/2matricesAandBthatcommute( AB=\nBA). Let\nHX= [A,B]andHZ= [BT,AT].\nThe SIP condition is clearly satisﬁed by deﬁni-\ntion, and in [35], AandBare chosen as binary\ncirculant matrices so that they commute. Bicy-\ncle codes are dual containing CSS codes where\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 9B=AT. Compared to the HP codes, these\ncodes generally have a wider range of parameters;\nin particular, they can have a higher rate while\npreserving the estimated error threshold [35]. In\n[15], Panteleev and Kalachev use binary polyno-\nmials over rings to deﬁne the circulant matrices\nfor constructing [[n,k]]family of generalized bi-\ncycle codes. The choice of circulant matrices de-\ntermines the properties of both the classical-type\nTSs and the symmetric stabilizers in the code.\nHence, the observations on QTSs in the example\nwe discuss next can be generalized to the code\nfamily.\nExample 2 For illustration, in our TS analysis,\nwe chose the A1[[254,28]]code, where the circu-\nlant size is 127,a(x) = 1 +x15+x20+x28+x66\nandb(x) = 1 +x58+x59+x100+x121as given\nin Appendix B in [15]. The girth of the Tanner\ngraph is six, CN degree ρ= 10and VN degree\nγ= 5.\n4.1.1 Classical-type trapping sets\nBased on our QTS deﬁnition, we search for QTSs\nof small size (upto a= 5) present in the A1code\nin Ex. 2. As noted in [15], based on the circu-\nlant matrices in the A1code, it does not have\n(a,b)trapping sets with b≤5. The (5,5)TS\nis the most harmful small sub-graph present in\nthe Tanner graph, making BP based iterat\n The (5,5)TS\nis the most harmful small sub-graph present in\nthe Tanner graph, making BP based iterative de-\ncoders to fail for low weight error patterns. The\ncritical number and strength of this TS are deter-\nmined by the speciﬁc decoder used and the neigh-\nborhood of the (5,5)TS. Fig. 7 shows the dense\n(5,5)TS present in both the circulant matrices\nAandB. From their cyclic property, we can lo-\ncate 127 (equal to the circulant size) isomorphic\n(5,5)TSs in each of them. In the Fig. 7, blue\nand red shaded circles for the VNs indicate their\nrelative position in the HXmatrix, from Aand\nBrespectively.\nThe (5,5)trapping set in Fig. 7 has ﬁve vari-\nablenodes. Everyvariablenodeshaveexactlythe\nsame VN degree ρ= 5and one odd-degree check\nnode neighbor (black squares). The number of\nsmall cycles within the trapping set and their\nsymmetry makes this a hard conﬁguration to de-\ncode. For simple binary decoders like syndrome\nbased Gallager-B, any weight three or more er-\nror patterns will result in a failure inducing set.\nHence, the critical number for the (5,5)TS with\nFigure 7: A (5,5)TS with 5variable nodes and 5odd\ndegree check nodes (the shaded squares represent the\nodd-degree checks). The degree of every variable node\nis5. The blue and red shaded circles for the variable\nnodes indicate their relative position in the HXmatrix,\nfromAandB, respectively.\nthe Gallager-B algorithm is µ= 3. For stronger\ndecoders such as BP and MSA decoder, the be-\nhavior is more complex and interesting. Any\nweight- 5error pattern in the TS in the circulant\nmatrixAindicated by blue qubits results in a\nfailure, whereas similar error patterns in the TSs\nin the circulant matrix B(indicated by the red\nqubits) are decoded correctly. Such a behavior is\ntypically attributed to the neighborhood of the\nTS in the Tanner graph. Whether a TS is harm-\nful depends not just on the graphical conﬁgura-\ntion, but also on the neighborhood and the de-\ncoder. This “true” behavior of all such quantum\nTSs can be systematic\nn the neighborhood and the de-\ncoder. This “true” behavior of all such quantum\nTSs can be systematically analyzed and charac-\nterized by extending the sub-graph expansion-\ncontraction algorithm [22] developed for classical\nLDPC codes to quantum codes, and it is left for\nfuture work.\n4.1.2 Symmetric stabilizer trapping sets\nFailures of syndrome-based iterative decoding on\ngeneralized bicycle code also consist of the degen-\nerate error patterns in symmetric stabilizers dis-\ncussed in the Section 3.1.2. An example of a pair\nof symmetric degenerate error patterns of weight\nﬁve in the Ex. 2 code is shown in Fig. 5(a) and\nFig.5(b).

Also, these er-\nror patterns induce isomorphic sub-graphs - trees\nwithout any cycles, quite distinct from the error\npatterns in classical-type TSs which are usually\ncomposed of one or more cycles. Using the cyclic\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify.

Breaking such TSs requires use asymmetric\nupdate of variable node decisions such as used\nin a layered/serial decoder. Since such symmet-\nric trapping sets have clear distinction of red and\nblue nodes with respect to the cyclic matrices A\nandB, wecanidentifythelayereddecodersched-\nule that can break such trapping sets.\n4.2 Hypergraph product codes\nHP codes by Tillich and Zemor [8] and their\nimprovements by Kovalev and Pryadko [36] are\nconstructed by taking Kronecker product (de-\nnoted as⊗) of t\nvements by Kovalev and Pryadko [36] are\nconstructed by taking Kronecker product (de-\nnoted as⊗) of two classical LDPC codes.

As we analyze\nthe cycle proﬁle of the Tanner graph of the classi-\ncal code used in Ex. 3, we observe that there are\n54cycles of length six ( 6-cycles) and 160 8-cycles.\nTable 1: HPG code parameters and number of cycles\nCode nmgχgχg+2\n[24,6,10] 2418654160\n[[900,36,10]] 9004326226814496\nThese cycles appear in the HP codes, multi-\nplying according to the size of the classical parity\ncheck matrix ( m= 18,n= 24) as given in Table\n1.

Also, there are two\nnon-isomorphic topologies of (5,3)TSs: one\nhundred and seventy (5,3)TSs whose induced\ngraph has a six, eight, and ten-cycle, and ﬁfteen\n(5,3)TSs having three eight cycles. All these\ntrapping sets manifest themselves in the HP\ncode with their count scaling as in the case of\nsmall cycles. In Table 2, we enumerate all the\nsmallest QTSs (with a≤5,b≤a) present in the\n[[900,36,10]]HP code having no CN with degree\n\u003E2in their induced sub-graphs. These values\nforaandbare chosen as such classical-type\nTSs are typically the most harmful for iterative\ndecoders. The QTS enumeration of HXandHZ\nfor symmetric HP codes is the same.

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 12This observation emphasizes the importance of\nthe decoder in characterizing the harmfulness of\nQTSs as in the case of classical TSs [22]. In the\nsubsequent section showing the applications of\nTS analysis, we will use the example of diﬀerent\ndecoding schedule that “breaks” such symmetry\nof the stabilizer.\n5 Using the QTS to des\n of diﬀerent\ndecoding schedule that “breaks” such symmetry\nof the stabilizer.\n5 Using the QTS to design better\nQLDPC codes and better decoders\nInthissection, weexplainpracticalimportanceof\nQTS analysis by providing two approaches for ﬁ-\nnitelengthQLDPCcodeanddecoderdesignwith\nQTS knowledge.\n5.1 Improved Code Design\nWhile previous research has observed the issue of\nsymmetric degenerate errors [13, 20], there has\nbeen no eﬀort to fully characterize them. Iden-\ntifying symmetric stabilizers, particularly of low\nweight in the QLDPC code is an important step\nin quantifying the eﬀect of degenerate errors on\niterative decoding. Removal of symmetry in low-\nweight stabilizers present in the Tanner graph,\nespecially during the QLDPC code design, sig-\nniﬁcantly reduces the number of instances of it-\nerative decoder failure. For example, during the\nrow removal step in the bicycle code [2] we care-\nfully modify the original bicycle code to obtain\ncodes wherein the stabilizer is asymmetric as in\nFig. 6(b). The BP decoder will able to match to\nthe syndrome (dark squares represent unsatisﬁed\nchecks) correctly with the red error pattern, in\ncontrast to the symmetric stabilizer in Fig. 6(a).\nSimilarly, inthecaseofHPcodes, carefulremoval\nof TSs in the constituent classical LDPC codes\nhelps to further optimize rate and minimum dis-\ntance properties. Such code design improvements\nlead to performance gains especially in the error\nﬂoor region for QLDPC codes. Here, we show\nan example of such an improved HP code design\nwith quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC [37] code for the\nconstituent classical LDPC code.\n5.1.1 Improved HP codes without harmful TSs\nOne of the disadvantages of QLDPC codes is that\nthe random code construction makes the stabi-\nlizers highly non-local, requiring arbitrary qubit-qubit inter-connectivity to perform check opera-\ntions. Using QC LDPC code brings structure to\nthe constituent codes and ﬂexibility in improv-\ning ﬁnite length QLDPC codes along with eﬃ-\ncient implementation of \ncodes and ﬂexibility in improv-\ning ﬁnite length QLDPC codes along with eﬃ-\ncient implementation of decoders. Instead of the\nrandom codes which are only optimized for girth\ng= 6, we construct QC [40,10,12]code with\ngirth 8, and make sure that small trapping sets\nare not present. The QC code with circulant size\nQ= 10is constructed by carefully choosing cir-\nculants to build the Tanner graph that is free of\n(4,2),(4,4),and(5,1)harmful trapping sets. For\na fair comparison, we use a random code of the\nsame size and minimum distance. The random\n[40,10,12] code is constructed to be cycle-4 free.\nThe HP codes constructed from these constituent\nclassical codes both have the same number (=\n21600)ofunavoidablelength-8cycles(seeLemma\n3) in their respective Tanner graphs, as it only\ndepends on the size of the component code and\ntheir variable and check node degrees. For the\nsymmetric HP code from regular LDPC code, we\ncan count these as m×/parenleftbigρ\n2/parenrightbig×n×/parenleftbigγ\n2/parenrightbig, wheremand\nncorrespond to the number of check nodes and\nvariable nodes, respectively, and dvanddcare\nvariable and check node degrees, respectively of\nthe constituent classical code. These 8-cycles can\nbe classiﬁed as (4,6)TSs and are not harmful for\niterative decoders like min-sum or BP algorithm.\nFig. 9 shows improved decoding performance\n(ﬂooding BP decoder with /lscriptmax= 100iterations)\nintheerrorﬂoorregimeforthenewlyconstructed\nQC HP code. Even though the curves start with\nasimilarwaterfallperformance(duetosamemin-\nimum distance), the randomly constructed code\nperformsworseintheerrorﬂoorregimecompared\nto the QC code. For the same code parameters,\nusing the QC component code improves the FER\nby nearly an order of magnitude at p≈0.005.\nThis improvement can be clearly attributed to\nthe absence of harmful TSs which were removed\nin the constituent QC code construction. The ex-\nample of the HP-LDPC code construction with\nQC constituent code is chosen considering their\nhardware fri\ne of the HP-LDPC code construction with\nQC constituent code is chosen considering their\nhardware friendly nature and simple bookkeep-\ning of trapping sets. In general, no speciﬁc code\nstructure is required in our method, and the con-\ncept, deﬁnition and analysis of trapping sets are\napplicable to random codes as well.\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify.

All curves are decoded using a\nBP decoder for /lscriptmax= 100iterations with the ﬂooding\nschedule. For the same code parameters, using the QC\ncomponent code without harmful trapping sets shows\nFER improvement (close to an order of magnitude) over\nthe random constituent code in the error ﬂoor region.\n5.2 Novel Decoder Design\nAn alternative or complementary approach is\nto devise iterative decoders that do not fail for\nthe error patterns in the QTSs identiﬁed for\nthe QLDPC code. This approach, prevalent\nin classical LDPC decoders (ﬁnite alphabet it-\nerative decoding (FAID) algorithms such as in\n[23]) do not ignore the topology of the TSs\nwhile devising decoder update rules. Breaking\nthe symmetry of messages by using non-linear\nmessage update rules leads to orders of mag-\nnitude decoding error performance improvement\n[23]. ForQLDPCiterativedecoders, thetypically\nused parallel/ﬂooding message update schedule\n(in the same iteration all variable/check nodes\nin the Tanner graph apply in parallel the same\nvariable/check update function, respectively) at-\ntributes to decoders’ failure to symmetric degen-\nerate errors. We devise decoder strategy that\ncorrects these errors by taking into account the\ntopology of the low-weight symmetric stabilizers\nin the code. Speciﬁcally,\ny taking into account the\ntopology of the low-weight symmetric stabilizers\nin the code. Speciﬁcally, we show that an MSA\ndecoder with sequential message update sched-\nule (layered decoder as in classical literature [38])\nthat uses the knowledge of location of the sym-\n10-210-110-810-610-410-2100Figure 10: FER performance comparison for the\nA1[[254,28]]code using the min-sum algorithm (MSA)\nfor two diﬀerent schedules: ﬂooding/parallel and lay-\nered schedule. The layered schedule is able to decode\nall the symmetric stabilizer TSs and numerous classical-\ntype TSs correctly leading to two orders of magnitude\nimprovement in the error ﬂoor regime (low physical error\nrates).\nmetric stabilizers in the code as well as other\nharmful trapping sets improves the error ﬂoor\ndecoding performance. As an intuitive example,\nsuppose the symmetric stabilizer of weight 6has\nsupport on variable nodes v1,...,v 6with sym-\nmetric degenerate error patterns: e1,e2,e3and\ne4,e5,e6. A layered decoder with the update or-\nder: starting with VN update of v1,v2,v3, fol-\nlowed by the check node updates, and then VN\nupdate ofv4,v5,v6converges to the correct error\npatternwithoutgettingtrapped. Sincethesched-\nuleorderiswithrespecttothevariablenodescor-\nresponding to the columns of the Hmatrix, we\nrefer to such schedule as column-layered.

In the following section 5.2.1, we com-\nparethetwoschedules: ﬂoodingMSAandlayered\nMSA decoders for the chosen QLDPC code.\n5.2.1 Layered Decoding to break QTSs\nWe employ a speciﬁc layered decoding sched-\nule to break the symmetric stabilizers in the\nA1[[254,28]]code in Fig. 10 using a column lay-\nered schedule. The layered schedule employed\nhere is based on the circulant-size of the cyclic\nmatricesAandB. The symmetric trapping sets\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify.

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 14have a clear distinction of red and blue nodes\nwith respect to these cyclic matrices, giving a\nstraight forward update order: v1,...,v 127fol-\nlowed byv128,...,v 254. The column-layered de-\ncoder (MSA with /lscriptmax= 20iterations) is able\nto decode all the symmetric stabilizer TSs and\nnumerous classical-type TSs correctly leading to\ntwoordersofmagnitudeimprovementintheerror\nﬂoor regime (low physical error rates) compared\nto the ﬂooding MSA decoder.2\nRemark 4 (Random perturbation and post-\nprocessing) With the QTS knowledge, we can\nconstruct iterative decoders without compu-\ntationally expensive post-processing steps,\nand thus reduce the decoding complexity and\nlatency. Note that the two curves in Fig. 10\nuse same maximum number of decoding iter-\nations (/lscriptmax = 20). In contrast, the heuristic\nrandom perturbation approach in [13] requires\nmany rounds of decoding attempts ( Dr) with\nadditional BP decoder iterations ( /lscriptr) each of\nwhich are initialized with perturbed channel\nlog-likelihood ratios on variable nodes that are\nneighbors of the unsatisﬁed syndromes. If we al-\nlot the same total number of decoding iterations\nto compare the random perturbation method\nwith BP, we observe that the advantage of using\nrandom perturbation is only observed with very\nlarge number of iterations. However, if the total\nnumber of iterations is set to 100 iterations,\nthe decoding performance improvement using\nheuristic methods is not signiﬁcant as illustrated\nin Fig. 11. For a signiﬁcant performance im-\nprovement, post processing step with random\nperturbation decoder requires much more de-\ncoding rounds (using /lscriptmax+ (Dr×/lscriptr) = 1700\niterations which is \u003E\u003E100) as shown in dashed-\nred-diamond curve. The heuristic choice of the\nrandomness parameter can be further improved\nby using feedback as in [41]. This is also shown\nto improve the convergence speed of the post-\n\noved\nby using feedback as in [41]. This is also shown\nto improve the convergence speed of the post-\nprocessing step, but it does not eliminate this\nstep completely. The performance improvement\nshown with the chosen layered schedule is to\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the QTS analysis.\nIf required, post-processing techniques as well as\nimprovements over heuristic approaches such as\n2In the Monte-Carlo simulations presented in the pa-\nper, we collect at least 100 errors for simulation points\nin the low FER region ensuring that they are statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\n10-210-110-1010-810-610-410-2100Figure 11: FER performance comparison for the\nA1[[254,28]]code using the belief propagation decoder\nwith the ﬂooding schedule with/without perturbation\nrounds (dashed/solid lines). When the total number of\niterations allowed are only 100 iterations, the dashed-\nblue-square marked and dashed-cyan-triangle marked\n(BP with random perturbation) curves do not outper-\nform the solid-red-diamond BP-only curve for 100itera-\ntions. For a signiﬁcant performance improvement, post\nprocessing step with random perturbation decoders re-\nquires much more decoding rounds as shown in dashed-\nred-diamond curve. Also, note that the heuristic choice\nof noise parameter value aﬀects these decoding improve-\nments.\nenhanced feedback decoding [41] and augmented\ndecoding [20] can be used as additional tools over\nthe iterative decoder based on QTS analysis.\nAn interesting result to note is that using more\niterations in the BP algorithm results in match-\ning with many degenerate error patterns in case\nof quantum LDPC codes. FER versus iterations\nof BP plotted in Fig. 12 shows that increasing it-\nerations of ﬂooding BP do not lower the FER\nin terms of purely classical errors (for the red\ncurve, the degenerate error patterns that match\nthe corresponding syndrome are considered as er-\nrors). However, such degenerate error patterns\nthat match the syndrome without introducing a\nlogical error are harmless for QLDP\nate error patterns\nthat match the syndrome without introducing a\nlogical error are harmless for QLDPC codes, re-\nsulting in lowering the FER with increasing itera-\ntions of BP. In our future work, we will devise im-\nproved message passing algorithms of lower com-\nplexity than BP that exploits the degeneracy of\nQLDPC codes systematically.\nRemark 5 These alternative improved decoders\nare an attractive solution when the QLDPC code\nAccepted in Quantum2021-09-28, click title to verify.

In contrast,\nclassical-like BP errors are plotted with the red-square\nmarkedcurvewithdegeneratematchingalsoclassiﬁedas\nan error in addition to the decoding failures. Quantum\ndecoders are observed to lower the FER with increasing\niterations of BP resulting from degenerate error match-\ning.\nand their structure is ﬁxed and modifying it is\nnot an option (due to technology or system-level\nconstraints in the future). Clearly, joint code and\ndecoder design would guarantee further decoding\nperformance improvement and a higher thresh-\nold.\n6 Summary and Future Work\nIn this paper, we identiﬁed and classiﬁed quan-\ntum trapping sets using their deﬁnition adapted\nfrom the classical error correction to address the\nsyndrome decoding scenario for QLDPC codes.\nThe knowledge of QTSs is shown to signiﬁcantly\nimprove stabilizer code/decoder designs and also\ndecoder performance in the error ﬂoor regimes\nof practical ﬁnite-length QLDPC codes. Analy-\nsis of failure conﬁgurations of the QLDPC codes,\nwhich are a generalization of the surface codes,\nwill have \nailure conﬁgurations of the QLDPC codes,\nwhich are a generalization of the surface codes,\nwill have near-future implications in surface code\ndesigns and their decoders.\nIn future work, we will analyze the ﬁnite length\nperformances of recently proposed QLDPC codes\nthat break the√ngrowing minimum distancebarrier [10] based on their QTS enumeration.\nWe will establish the parent-child relationship\nbetween the harmful sub-graphs and determine\ntheir relative harmfulness. Understanding the ef-\nfect of neighborhood of the Tanner graph with\nrespect to the decoder used is not easy, but im-\nportant to understand the actual harmful error\npatterns. In future work, we plan to modify the\nexpansion-contraction method [22] to QLDPC\ncodestoobtaintheexactsetofmostharmfulcon-\nﬁgurations that should be avoided in the Tanner\ngraphofQLDPCcodes.

The most popular and mature sources of such photonic entan-\nglement, e.g., those that leverage spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) or spontaneous\nfour-wave mixing (sFWM), generate an entangled (so called, continuous-variable) quantum state\nthat contains contributions from high-order photon terms that lie outside the span of the dual-rail\nbasis, which is detrimental to most applications. One often uses low pump power to mitigate the\ne\u000Bects of those high-order terms. However, that reduces the pair generation rate, and the source\nbecomes inherently probabilistic. We investigate a cascaded source that performs a linear-optical\nentanglement swap b\ny probabilistic. We investigate a cascaded source that performs a linear-optical\nentanglement swap between two SPDC sources, to generate a heralded photonic entangled state that\nhas a higher \fdelity (to the ideal Bell state) compared to a free-running SPDC source. Further,\nwith the Bell swap providing a heralding trigger, we show how to build a multiplexed source, which\ndespite reasonable switching losses and detector loss and noise, yields a Fidelity versus Success\nProbability trade-o\u000B of a high-e\u000Eciency source of high-\fdelity dual-rail photonic entanglement. We\n\fnd, however, that there is a threshold of 1 :5 dB of loss per switch, beyond which multiplexing hurts\nthe Fidelity versus Success Probability trade-o\u000B.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDistributed high-\fdelity entanglement will become a\ncommodity as its demand stemming from a variety of\npromising applications increases. As the world makes\nprogress towards realizing the vision of a quantum inter-\nnet[1] to generate entanglement among many user groups\nat high rates, some of the biggest remaining enabling-\ntechnology challenges, are: (1) scalable sources of high-\n\fdelity on-demand photonic entanglement, (2) high-\ne\u000Eciency high-bandwidth high-coherence-time universal-\nquantum-logic-capable quantum memories, and (3) high-\ne\u000Eciency converters between various qubit forms native\nto the leading quantum-memory contenders and optical-\nfrequency photonic qubits.\nWhile there are no viable alternatives to optical-\nfrequency qubits for long-distance transmission, there\nare many ways to encode a qubit in the photon [2].\nTwo of those most commonly studied are: (a) the Knill-\nLa\ramme-Milburn (KLM) dual-rail photonic qubit [3]\nwhere the presence of a single photon in one of two\northogonal (spatial, spectral, temporal or polarization)\nmodes encodes the two logical quantum states of a qubit;\nand (b) the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encod-\ning [4], which encodes the qubit in a single bosonic mode\nexcited in one of two coherent superpositions\n [4], which encodes the qubit in a single bosonic mode\nexcited in one of two coherent superpositions of displaced\nquadrature-squeezed states that are shifted with respect\nto one another in the phase space. Dual-rail qubits\n\u0003saikat@arizona.eduare conceptually easy to produce and manipulate using\npassive linear optics, but they need high-\fdelity single-\nphoton sources and single-photon detectors. Quantum\nlogic on dual-rail qubits using passive linear optics and\nsingle-photon detectors is simple to build. Despite the\ngates being inherently probabilistic in the original KLM\nscheme [3], recent advancements on single-photon ancilla-\nassisted boosted linear-optical quantum logic [5] has ush-\nered linear optical quantum computing using dual rail\nqubits into highly scalable architectures [6{8]. Alterna-\ntively, GKP qubit is known to be the most loss-resilient\nphotonic qubit encoding [2, 9], and Cli\u000Bord quantum\nlogic is deterministically implementable using squeezers\nand linear optics [4]. However, not only are they hard\nto produce [10, 11], there is no known way to store GKP\nqubits and GKP-basis entangled states in heralded quan-\ntum memories. In this paper, we will therefore focus on\nthe dual-rail qubit. The multiplexed heralded entangle-\nment generation ideas we present here, however, are ap-\nplicable to other photonic qubit encodings and to other\n(e.g., multi-qubit) entangled states.\nWe focus in this work on the \frst challenge men-\ntioned in the \frst paragraph above: that of design-\ning an on-demand photonic entanglement source that\nproduces high-\fdelity two-qubit entangled Bell states\nwith the qubits encoded in the dual-rail photonic ba-\nsis. There have been many calculations of quantum re-\npeater protocols [12, 13] and quantum network routing\nalgorithms [14, 15] which assume the availability of unit-\nFidelity sources of dual-rail photonic entanglement. This\nresults in these analyses predicting, despite inclusion of2\nlinear losses everywhere in the system, pristine dual-\nse analyses predicting, despite inclusion of2\nlinear losses everywhere in the system, pristine dual-\nrail Bell states, i.e., entangled bits (ebits), be delivered\nto the communicating parties Alice and Bob. In real-\nity, sources that deterministically generate dual-rail Bell\nstates suitable for communications are quite challenging\nto build. Sub-unity entanglement \fdelity has been in-\ncorporated in recent work on entanglement routing [16],\nbut those have restricted their analyses to ideal Werner-\nlike entangled states. Quantum dot sources [17, 18] and\nother forms of quantum emitters [19] can theoretically\ngenerate single photons and entangled photon pairs on\ndemand. Recently, these sources have achieved high (po-\nlarization) entanglement \fdelity [20] and over 60% cou-\npling e\u000Eciency into single-mode optical \fber [21], though\nnot in the same experiment. Moreover, the photon fre-\nquencies from individual emitters can vary slightly, and\nthe emitted photon frequency is usually not compatible\nwith telecommunications hardware. The most common\nand reliable sources of dual-rail entanglement used in\npractice rely on spontaneous parametric down conversion\n(SPDC) [22{24], wherein single photons from a strong\npump laser impinging on a carefully phase-matched (pos-\nsibly periodically-poled) \u001F(2)crystal splits into entan-\ngled photon pairs at two frequencies. Alternatively, one\ncan employ the process of spontaneous four-wave mixing\n(FWM), in which a pair of pump photons give rise to an\nentangled pair [25, 26]. For further analyses, we will refer\nto SPDC but the conclusions would be equally valid for\nFWM sources.\nThere are many variants of SPDC-based entangled\nphoton pair generation methods. However, a detailed\nphysical analysis of these sources has shown that the com-\nplete quantum state generated, described by two copies of\nthe so-called two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV), con-\ntains contributions from vacuum and higher-order, e.g.,\ntwo-photon-pair terms in addition to the desired du\nontributions from vacuum and higher-order, e.g.,\ntwo-photon-pair terms in addition to the desired dual-\nrail Bell state, which can adversely a\u000Bect both the dis-\ntribution rates and the Fidelity of the distributed en-\ntanglement [27{29]. In fact, the pump power must be\ncarefully optimized to maximize the entanglement rate,\nwhile adhering to a desired Fidelity threshold. One com-\nmon strategy is to turn down the pump power so low\nthat the probability that the source produces two-pair\n(and higher-order) states becomes negligible. Of course,\nthis increases the contribution of vacuum to the emitted\nstate and reduces the rate at which the desired Bell states\nare produced. The vacuum term often does not a\u000Bect\nthe usability of the source in an application, either be-\ncause it gets \fltered out by the `click' of a detector, e.g.,\nin a quantum key distribution (QKD) experiment that\nprovides a post-selection trigger to consider only those\ntimes slots that hada photon in it; or because a quan-\ntum memory provides a heralding trigger declaring that\nit successfully loaded a dual-rail photonic qubit into its\nnative qubit domain (hence \fltering out the vacuum).\nOther than the reduced pair-production rate of the\nabove strategy of turning down the pump power, another\ninherent problem with such a `free-running' standaloneSPDC-based entanglement source is that it is probabilis-\ntic, and does not have a heralding trigger. In other words,\nwe cannot in principle know in which time slot the source\nactually produced an entangled photon pair, a major\ndetriment in many applications. One method to increase\nthe probability of emitting a single photon into a partic-\nular time slot is to use a heralded single-photon source\n(HSPS), e.g., from SPDC, combined with spatial, tem-\nporal [30, 31], or spectral multiplexing [32, 33]. However,\nfor this to work with entangled pairs would require one of\nthe photons to be detected immediately, undesirable for\nmany applications. A second option is to use (four)\ntons to be detected immediately, undesirable for\nmany applications. A second option is to use (four) single\nphotons possibly from a multiplexed HSPS as inputs to a\nquantum circuit that probabilistically produces heralded\nentangled pairs [34{36]; combined with multiplexing this\ncould enable `entanglement on demand'. Schemes to si-\nmultaneously generate multiple indistinguishable single\nphotons in di\u000Berent spatial modes in \\parallel states\"\nhave been studied by Ref. [37]. These parallel states can\nbe utilized for resource state generation by the proba-\nbilistic entangled pair generation circuitry.\nIn this paper, we propose a source design that alle-\nviates all of the above-listed problems, yielding a high-\nrate,high-\fdelity ,near-deterministic source of dual-rail\nentangled photonic qubit pairs, at the cost of high levels\nof multiplexing. The concept is inspired from prior work\non heralded [38] and multiplexed [31, 39] SPDC-based\nsingle-photon sources: we \frst create what we call a cas-\ncaded SPDC source , which employs two SPDC-based en-\ntanglement sources, and performs a linear-optical Bell\nstate measurement (BSM), commonly called an `entan-\nglement swap', to yield an entangled state on the `outer'\nundetected mode pairs. This state has much lower vac-\nuum and high-order-photon contributions compared to\na standalone SPDC source. Thereafter, we leverage the\nheralding trigger from the BSM to multiplex M \u003E 1 such\ncascaded sources, using two switch-arrays (each consist-\ning of log2Mswitches) and a controller that lets out\nentangled photon pairs from the `successful' source, in\norder to improve the pair-production rate. See Fig. 1 for\nthe overall concept. The switching losses, which scale\nup logarithmically in M, and photon-number-resolving\n(PNR) detector imperfections within the BSM, i.e., ef-\n\fciency and dark counts, are incorporated into the en-\ngineering design study of the Fidelity versus entangle-\nment generation rate of the overall heralded-multiplexed\nsource.\nThe a\nthe Fidelity versus entangle-\nment generation rate of the overall heralded-multiplexed\nsource.\nThe article is organized as follows. Section II discusses\nthe full quantum-state description of an SPDC-based en-\ntanglement source, and our proposal for the cascaded\nsource with a heralding trigger. Section III describes\nan idealized model of a heralded quantum memory that\nwe use in the remainder of our analysis. Section IV\npresents a detailed performance evaluation of the ideal\ncascaded source. The modi\fcation of functionality with\ndevice impairments is examined in Sec. V.

CASCADED SPDC SOURCE\nA. Dual-Rail Entangled SPDC source: A review\nDual-rail encoded photonic qubits are de\fned by the\npresence of a single photon in one of two orthogonal\nmodes [3]. In what follows, we use the language of po-\nlarization entangled states, but the arguments all apply\nequally well to any dual-rail encoding, utilizing any de-\ngree of freedom, i.e., polarization, time-bin, spatial path,\ntransverse spatial mode, frequency or mixed temporal-\nspectral [40]. We denote the logical qubit states as j\u00160i\nandj\u00161i; in the two-mode representation they can be ex-\npressed asj0;1iandj1;0irespectively. We will use the\nfollowing notation for two (of the four) mutually orthog-\nonal dual-rail two-qubit Bell states:\nj\t\u0006i\u00111p\n2(j\u00161;\u00160i+j\u00160;\u00161i) =j1;0; 0;1i\u0006j0;1; 1;0ip\n2:\n(1)The (\u0006) signs in Eqs. (2) and (1) refer to the possibility\nof an additional \u0019phase that could be applied to one of\nthe polarization modes of one output pulse, e.g., using\na half wave-plate, depending upon whether the desired\nBell state for the application is j\t+iorj\t\u0000i.\nA complete quantum-theoretic modeling of the\npolarization-dual-rail SPDC-based pulsed entanglement\nsource was presented in [28, 29]. The physical model\nof this entanglement source can be seen as two copies\nof two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states with one\nmode of each TMSV swapped. See Fig. 2 for a schematic\nrepresentation. The output is described by four modes:\ntwo orthogonal polarization modes of each of the (spatio-\ntemporal) modes of a pair of pulses emitted by the source.\nHence, a two-qubit entangled Bell state requires four or-\nthogonal modes to encode. The quantum state of this\n4-mode output is given by:\nj \u0006i=1X\nn=0nX\nk=0(\u00061)kr\np(n)\nn+ 1jn\u0000k;k;k;n\u0000ki;(2)\nwhere\np(n) = (n+ 1)Nsn\n(Ns+ 1)n+2; (3)\nwithNsthe mean photon number per mode. Note that,\nhence, the mean photon number per (dual-rail\n; (3)\nwithNsthe mean photon number per mode. Note that,\nhence, the mean photon number per (dual-rail) qubit is\n2Ns. It should also be noted that this 4-mode state is a\nGaussian state, i.e., its Wigner function is an 8-variate\nGaussian function of the \feld quadratures of the con-\ncerned modes. Hence, it is essentially a tensor product\nof two TMSV states with a pair of mode labels \ripped.\nvacvacvacvac\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"jixzMmSQAscOYqYWq2hZaxoOkV8=\"\u003EAAACBXicbVDLSsNAFJ34rPVVdekmWIS6KUkRdVl047KifWAbymR60w6dTMLMjVBD1/6AW/0Dd+LW7/AH/A6nbRbaeuDC4Zx7OZfjx4JrdJwva2l5ZXVtPbeR39za3tkt7O03dJQoBnUWiUi1fKpBcAl15CigFSugoS+g6Q+vJn7zAZTmkbzDUQxeSPuSB5xRNNL9bbdS6jwC0pNuoeiUnSnsReJmpEgy1LqF704vYkkIEpmgWrddJ0YvpQo5EzDOdxINMWVD2oe2oZKGoL10+vHYPjZKzw4iZUaiPVV/X6Q01HoU+mYzpDjQ895E/NfzFR0CzqVjcOGlXMYJgmSz8CARNkb2pBK7xxUwFCNDKFPc/G+zAVWUoSkub4px52tYJI1K2T0ruzenxeplVlGOHJIjUiIuOSdVck1qpE4YkeSZvJBX68l6s96tj9nqkpXdHJA/sD5/AOTVmJE=\u003C/latexit\u003ES2(⇣)\n\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"jixzMmSQAscOYqYWq2hZaxoOkV8=\"\u003EAAACBXicbVDLSsNAFJ34rPVVdekmWIS6KUkRdVl047KifWAbymR60w6dTMLMjVBD1/6AW/0Dd+LW7/AH/A6nbRbaeuDC4Zx7OZfjx4JrdJwva2l5ZXVtPbeR39za3tkt7O03dJQoBnUWiUi1fKpBcAl15CigFSugoS+g6Q+vJn7zAZTmkbzDUQxeSPuSB5xRNNL9bbdS6jwC0pNuoeiUnSnsReJmpEgy1LqF704vYkkIEpmgWrddJ0YvpQo5EzDOdxINMWVD2oe2oZKGoL10+vHYPjZKzw4iZUaiPVV/X6Q01HoU+mYzpDjQ895E/NfzFR0CzqVjcOGlXMYJgmSz8CARNkb2pBK7xxUwFCNDKFPc/G+zAVWUoSkub4px52tYJI1K2T0ruzenxeplVlGOHJIjUiIuOSdVck1qpE4YkeSZvJBX68l6s96tj9nqkpXdHJA/sD5/AOTVmJE=\u003C/latexit\u003ES2(⇣)\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"/fQ2E8D8KAfy92mWA7Gk8tT+2Tk=\"\u003EAAACAXicbVDLSgNBEJyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKeyKqMegF48RzAOSJcxOepMxs7PrTG8ghJz8Aa/6B97Eq1/iD/gdTpI9aGJBQ1HVTTUVJFIYdN0vJ7eyura+kd8sbG3v7O4V9w/qJk41hxqPZaybATMghYIaCpTQTDSwKJDQCAY3U78xBG1ErO5xlIAfsZ4SoeAMrVRvw2Mqhp1iyS27M9Bl4mWkRDJUO8XvdjfmaQQKuWTGtDw3QX/MNAouYVJopwYSxgesBy1LFYvA+OPZtxN6YpUuDWNtRyGdqb8vxiwyZhQFdjNi2DeL3lT81ws0GwAupGN45Y+FSlIExefhYSopxnRaB+0KDRzlyBLGtbD/U95nmnG0pRVsMd5iDcukflb2Lsre3Xmpcp1VlCdH5JicEo9ckgq5JVVSI5w8kGfyQl6dJ+fNeXc+5qs5J7s5JH/gfP4AF/OXqg==\u003C/latexit\u003E⌘Original Sou\n2Lsre3Xmpcp1VlCdH5JicEo9ckgq5JVVSI5w8kGfyQl6dJ+fNeXc+5qs5J7s5JH/gfP4AF/OXqg==\u003C/latexit\u003E⌘Original Sourcevac⊗\"\n\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"wrI1nzwiQZ1NFRBgntPAmSywwB0=\"\u003EAAACAXicbVDLSgNBEJz1GeMr6tHLYBA8hV0V9Rj04jGCeUCyhNlJbzJmdnaZ6RVCyMkf8Kp/4E28+iX+gN/hbLIHTSxoKKq6qaaCRAqDrvvlLC2vrK6tFzaKm1vbO7ulvf2GiVPNoc5jGetWwAxIoaCOAiW0Eg0sCiQ0g+FN5jcfQRsRq3scJeBHrK9EKDhDKzU6ASArdktlt+JOQReJl5MyyVHrlr47vZinESjkkhnT9twE/THTKLiESbGTGkgYH7I+tC1VLALjj6ffTuixVXo0jLUdhXSq/r4Ys8iYURTYzYjhwMx7mfivF2g2BJxLx/DKHwuVpAiKz8LDVFKMaVYH7QkNHOXIEsa1sP9TPmCacbSlZcV48zUsksZpxbuonN2dl6vXeUUFckiOyAnxyCWpkltSI3XCyQN5Ji/k1Xly3px352O2uuTkNwfkD5zPH0Xulyg=\u003C/latexit\u003E\u0000\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"hkH9JA5JdOwTkgtrJdJlndR05zE=\"\u003EAAACCXicbVBLSgNBEO2Jvxh/UZduBoPgKsyoqMugG5cRzAcyk9DT6UmadPc03TVCGHICL+BWb+BO3HoKL+A57CSz0MQHBY/3qqiqFynODHjel1NYWV1b3yhulra2d3b3yvsHTZOkmtAGSXii2xE2lDNJG8CA07bSFIuI01Y0up36rUeqDUvkA4wVDQUeSBYzgsFK3WBEIQuUYd1AiUmvXPGq3gzuMvFzUkE56r3yd9BPSCqoBMKxMR3fUxBmWAMjnE5KQWqowmSEB7RjqcSCmjCbXT1xT6zSd+NE25LgztTfExkWxoxFZDsFhqFZ9Kbiv16ksX1rYTvE12HGpEqBSjJfHqfchcSdxuL2maYE+NgSTDSz97tkiDUmYMMr2WD8xRiWSfOs6l9Wz+8vKrWbPKIiOkLH6BT56ArV0B2qowYiSKNn9IJenSfnzXl3PuatBSefOUR/4Hz+AKm1m00=\u003C/latexit\u003E| ±i\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"hkH9JA5JdOwTkgtrJdJlndR05zE=\"\u003EAAACCXicbVBLSgNBEO2Jvxh/UZduBoPgKsyoqMugG5cRzAcyk9DT6UmadPc03TVCGHICL+BWb+BO3HoKL+A57CSz0MQHBY/3qqiqFynODHjel1NYWV1b3yhulra2d3b3yvsHTZOkmtAGSXii2xE2lDNJG8CA07bSFIuI01Y0up36rUeqDUvkA4wVDQUeSBYzgsFK3WBEIQuUYd1AiUmvXPGq3gzuMvFzUkE56r3yd9BPSCqoBMKxMR3fUxBmWAMjnE5KQWqowmSEB7RjqcSCmjCbXT1xT6zSd+NE25LgztTfExkWxoxFZDsFhqFZ9Kbiv16ksX1rYTvE12HGpEqBSjJfHqfchcSdxuL2maYE+NgSTDSz97tkiDUmYMMr2WD8xRiWSfOs6l9Wz+8vKrWbPKIiOkLH6BT56ArV0B2qowYiSKNn9IJenSfnzXl3PuatBSefOUR/4Hz+AKm1m00=\u003C/latexit\u003E| ±i\nFigure 2. A block model of the individual SPDC-based source\nof dual-rail entangled qubit pairs as presented in Ref. [28].\nThe output quantum state is approximated by Eq. (4). S2(\u0010)\ndenotes a two-mode squeezing unitary, jvacidenotes a single-\nmode vacuum state, and the squeezing amplitude \u0010is related\nto\neezing unitary, jvacidenotes a single-\nmode vacuum state, and the squeezing amplitude \u0010is related\nto the mean photon number per mode, Ns, as sinh2j\u0010j=Ns.\nOne beam from each two-mode squeezed source is swapped\nand a potential optical phase-shift \f(= 0 or\u0019) is introduced.\nAppendix A includes a more detailed description and deriva-\ntion of the quantum state description of this source.\nSince we will be concerned with the Ns\u001C1 regime in\nthis paper, we will henceforth truncate the quantum state\nof the source up to the photon-number (Fock) support of4\n2 photon pairs [27]:\nj \u0006i=N0\"\np\np(0)j0;0; 0;0i+r\np(1)\n2(j1;0; 0;1i\u0006j0;1; 1;0i)\n+r\np(2)\n3(j2;0; 0;2i\u0006j1;1; 1;1i+j0;2; 2;0i)#\n;\n(4)\nwhere we introduce N0\u00111=p\np(0) +p(1) +p(2) =\n(Ns+ 1)2=p\n6N2s+ 4Ns+ 1 as a normalization factor\nthat we choose for convenience to ensure that j\t\u0006i, de-\nspite the Fock truncation, is a unit-norm quantum state.\nIn Appendix A, we show that for Ns&0:2 the above\ntruncated state leads to a bad approximation. Since all\nthe results in this paper will use Ns\u001C0:2, this does not\napply to the results reported herein. In Appendix G, we\nshow how one would do a full exact analysis of every-\nthing reported in this paper, while employing the com-\nplete Gaussian-state description of j \u0006i.\nThe four-mode output state j \u0006iin (2) is a superposi-\ntion of vacuum, one of the two desired dual-rail-basis\nBell statesj\t\u0006i, and additional states corresponding\nton\u00152 pairs of photons (in each of the two output\npulses), with a geometrically distributed probability am-\nplitudep(n) as given in Eq. (3). Without the aid of\nauxiliary highly non-linear operations such as a quan-\ntum memory or a non-demolition measurement we dis-\ncuss later in this paper, these higher-order n-photon-pair\nterms cannot be eliminated from the source output, as\nthe very nature of the underlying TMSV model deter-\nmines the proportion of these `spurious' terms. Reducing\nthe mean photon number per mode Nsby turning down\nthe pump power does reduce the proportion \neducing\nthe mean photon number per mode Nsby turning down\nthe pump power does reduce the proportion of two-pair\ntermsp(2) = 3N2\ns=(Ns+ 1)4, but, this happens at the\nexpense of reducing p(1) as well, and hence increasing\np(0); in the Ns\u001C1 regime, the vacuum term domi-\nnates. A quantum non demolition (QND) measurement\nthat performs a vacuum or not (VON) projection [41] on\nthe source output could aid in eliminating the vacuum\ncomponent. However, existing experimental proposals\nfor implementing such a QND measurement involve non-\nlinear atom-photon interactions [42], and are currently\ninfeasible to realize e\u000Eciently on traveling modes of an\noptical-frequency \feld.\nB. Cascaded SPDC source using two\npolarization-entangled sources and a BSM\nWe now describe our design of a cascaded source whose\noutput state's Fidelity with the desired Bell state can be\nhigher than that of a standalone SPDC source's ouput\nj \u0006idescribed in the previous subsection. The proposed\ndesign is shown in Fig. 3. We take two copies of j \u0006i\n(labeled `original source' in a green box), and perform\na local linear optical BSM using beamsplitters and four\nPNR detectors. For the purposes of this section, we willassume that all the components are ideal. This means we\nconsider no coupling losses from the SPDC sources into\nthe BSM, perfect mode-matching for the output photons,\nand ideal PNR detectors in the circuit. We will relax\nthese assumptions in the more detailed analysis in the\nSec. V. If the states fed into the BSM were ideal Bell\nstates, i.e., with no multi-pair contributions, the result-\ning state of the unmeasured four outer modes (shown as\nblack arrows in Fig. 3) would be ideal Bell states as well.\nHowever, since the outputs (4) of the original sources\nj \u0006iare not ideal Bell states j\t\u0006i, despite observing\na BSM `success', we might generate spurious states on\nthose outer modes that are not Bell states., i.e. arising\nfrom events where both pairs of photons originated in the\nsame source.\n: 50-50 beamspli\ni.e. arising\nfrom events where both pairs of photons originated in the\nsame source.\n: 50-50 beamsplitter: Photon Number Resolving Detector \u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"/fQ2E8D8KAfy92mWA7Gk8tT+2Tk=\"\u003EAAACAXicbVDLSgNBEJyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKeyKqMegF48RzAOSJcxOepMxs7PrTG8ghJz8Aa/6B97Eq1/iD/gdTpI9aGJBQ1HVTTUVJFIYdN0vJ7eyura+kd8sbG3v7O4V9w/qJk41hxqPZaybATMghYIaCpTQTDSwKJDQCAY3U78xBG1ErO5xlIAfsZ4SoeAMrVRvw2Mqhp1iyS27M9Bl4mWkRDJUO8XvdjfmaQQKuWTGtDw3QX/MNAouYVJopwYSxgesBy1LFYvA+OPZtxN6YpUuDWNtRyGdqb8vxiwyZhQFdjNi2DeL3lT81ws0GwAupGN45Y+FSlIExefhYSopxnRaB+0KDRzlyBLGtbD/U95nmnG0pRVsMd5iDcukflb2Lsre3Xmpcp1VlCdH5JicEo9ckgq5JVVSI5w8kGfyQl6dJ+fNeXc+5qs5J7s5JH/gfP4AF/OXqg==\u003C/latexit\u003E⌘Cascaded SourceHeralding TriggerSignalOriginal SourceOriginal Source\nInput: vac⊗\"\n\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"+MYGsaV1wRv4SrPUv7/sK6Z+rqE=\"\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\u003C/latexit\u003E|Si\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"+MYGsaV1wRv4SrPUv7/sK6Z+rqE=\"\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\nUVOZVokrURuVuGqebQQaxSx77p7Z53JHDNw1sIxYww0RQORfQmAyfLzAxDdFx+RO+uOnoshNGrnPxODtMKy51iSDZ5t5npQhRhXUWw5wbYCjWHlBmuI9OyBbUUIY+sX0fyrgbwYvgdDSMXw0PPh0Mjt608dwlj8gT8pzE5DU5Iu/JMRkTRpbkO/lBfgYkeBa8CF5upL2d1vOQbK3g8DeTHSsP\u003C/latexit\u003E|Si\nFigure 3.

The\nreason the patterns are not su\u000Ecient is that these same\npatterns can also be produced by the undesirable event\nthat both photons detected in the BSM came from only\none of the SPDC sources, instead of one from each; unfor-\ntunately, the likelihood of these two processes are equal\nfor SPDC. Therefore, to exclude the undesirable photon\npair contribution from the same source, we must rely on\npost-selection of a photon in each outer mode- either via\ndirect detection or via a heralded quantum memory as\ndiscussed below.\nDepending upon which of the four `desirable' click pat-\nterns occur on the four PNR detectors (e.g., 0011 implies:\nno-click, no-click, 1-click, 1-click), the values of m1and\nm2in the heralded state in Eq. (5) are given by:\nClick Patte\n 1-click, 1-click), the values of m1and\nm2in the heralded state in Eq. (5) are given by:\nClick Pattern m 1m2\n0011 0 0\n1100 0 1\n1001 1 1\n0110 1 0\nIf both the `original' sources produce the state j \u0000i, the\nheralded output state of the undetected outer modes is\nsame as given in Eq. (5), except that the values of m2in\nthe above table are \ripped.\nHenceforth, we will drop the \u0006superscript in the state\njS\u0006i, since we will always assume to be working with\nthe statejS+i. Further, we will say the source was `suc-\ncessful' in producing an entangled state when one of the\n\frst two desirable click patterns above (0011 or 1100) oc-\ncur (i.e.,m1= 0, though to be clear these click patterns\ncan also arise when a single source produces both pairs).\nThe reason for this is that we want the output state to\nbe (close to) the jS+istate. We will use jSito denote\nthe desirable output state of the cascaded source, and\nnot carry the m2index. This is because our results in\nthis paper do not depend upon the value of m2. Further,\nif the memories (that load the distributed qubits) have\nfaithful native quantum logic gates, it is easy to apply a\nlocal single-qubit unitary operation to turn the Bell state\nj\t\u0000iintoj\t+i, and vice versa. So, if one wishes to be\ninclusive of the output state produced to be (close to)\nthej\t\u0000istate as well, our expression for the probability\nof success, in Eq. (10) for instance, can be multiplied by\n2. Appendix C describes a hybrid modeling strategy that\nwas used to derive the above results.\nIn what follows, we will represent the cascaded source\nas the orange box shown in Fig. 3. The cascaded source\nhas a heralding trigger , telling us in which time slot a\ncopy ofjSiwas produced successfully, a feature missing\nin the original SPDC-based entanglement source.III. IDEALIZED MODEL OF A HERALDED\nQUANTUM MEMORY\nQuantum memories (QMs) are an essential component\nof entanglement distribution protocols; especially so for\nbuilding quantum repeaters for long-distance entangle-\nment di\nribution protocols; especially so for\nbuilding quantum repeaters for long-distance entangle-\nment distribution, and in distilling high-Fidelity entan-\nglement from low-Fidelity entangled qubit pairs. Memo-\nries that can e\u000Eciently load one qubit of a photonic en-\ntangled state, are necessary to store the quantum state\nfor a time duration appropriate for the end application,\nor when it is ready to be interfaced to a larger quantum\nprocessor system, e.g., for performing teleported gates\nfor distributed quantum computing.\nAlthough various proposals for quantum memories ex-\nist in the literature, for the purposes of the performance\nevaluation of the source we propose in this paper, we\nwant to distill two important characteristics pertinent to\nour analysis: the QM can selectively load one dual-rail\nqubit (i.e., two orthogonal optical modes), and it has\na heralding trigger. In other words, when the memory\nis successful in loading the qubit, it raises a (classical)\nbinary-valued \rag declaring a success or a failure .\nWe will consider a rather idealized model for such\na memory: one that performs a vacuum-or-not (VON)\nmeasurement, in a quantum non-demolition (QND) way.\nThe QND measurement performed by this QM on the\ntwo incident modes can be expressed by the following\npositive-operator-valued measure (POVM) operators:\n^\u00050=j0;0ih0;0j;^\u00051=^I2\u0000j0;0ih0;0j; (7)\nwhere ^I2=P\nm;njn;mihn;mjis the identity opera-\ntor of the two-mode bosonic Hilbert space. If a two-\nmode optical quantum state j i=P\nm;ncm;njm;niis\nincident on this QM, with probability pvac=jc0;0j2,\nthe memory would raise a failure \rag, and the post-\nmeasurement state will be vacuum j vaci=j0;0i, i.e.,\nnothing would be loaded into the quantum memory.\nHowever, with probability pnot-vac = 1\u0000pvac, the memory\nwould raise the success \rag, and the post-measurement\nstate would bej not-vaci=N\u0000\nj i\u0000c0;0j0;0i\u0001\n, where\nN= 1=p\n1\u0000jc0;0j2is a normalization constant. Note\nthat if a two-photon state is incident on this memory, it\nisstore\n2is a normalization constant. Note\nthat if a two-photon state is incident on this memory, it\nisstored; however, in that case, for the incident state (5),\nthe other ideal quantum memory would receive no pho-\ntons, and this case would be rejected.\nAn experimental proposal for this VON measurement,\nwith a photonic-domain post-measurement state was\nconceived by Oi et al. in [42], using a reversible V-\nSTIRAP atom-photon interaction. A QND VON mea-\nsurement, with the post-measurement state being stored\nin a spin-based qubit, is implicit in a recently-published\nexperiment on measurement-device-independent (MDI)\nQKD to beat the repeater-less rate bound, using an asyn-\nchronous BSM based on a silicon-vacancy color center\nin a diamond nanophotonic chip [43]. A closely related\nplatform for the processing and storage of polarization6\nencoded dual rail qubits has been proposed in Ref. [44].\nThe requirement we impose on a QM to have a herald-\ning trigger is crucial to almost all quantum communica-\ntion protocols. Practically, one way to achieve this is\nby using memories that entangle the incoming photonic\nstate with the quantum state of the memory's internal\nqubit, for example, as in [43, 44]. The heralding trig-\nger consists of measuring the re\rected photonic quantum\nstate in the optical domain. The measurement outcome\nprojects the quantum state of the qubit held by the QM\ninto a local-unitary-equivalent of the photonic quantum\nstate.\nIV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE\nIDEAL CASCADED SPDC SOURCE\nIn this section, we will present a detailed analysis of the\ncascaded source when the associated hardware works ide-\nally, comparing the performance of the cascaded source\nwith that of the original non-cascaded (SPDC-based en-\ntanglement) source.\nA. Fidelity, assuming ideal devices\nFirst, we compare the Fidelity of the generated states\nwith the target Bell state j\t+i. For the original source,\nthis is given by:\nF(j +i;j\t+i) =jh +j\t+ij2=\f\f\fN0p\np(1)\f\f\f2\n:(8)\nSimilarly, the Fidelity of jSiwit\ne,\nthis is given by:\nF(j +i;j\t+i) =jh +j\t+ij2=\f\f\fN0p\np(1)\f\f\f2\n:(8)\nSimilarly, the Fidelity of jSiwithj\t+iis given by:\nF(jSi;j\t+i) =jhSj\t+ij2=\f\f\f\fN0\n0\u0001p(1)p\n2\f\f\f\f2\n=1\n2;(9)\nwhere the factor of 1 =2 arises from the unwanted cases\nwhere both detected photons came from the same source.\nNext, let us consider the Fidelities with j\t+ibut when\nboth mode pairs of the respective entangled states j i\n(original source) or jSi(cascaded source) are loaded into\na pair of idealized heralded quantum memories as de-\nscribed in Section III. It is simple to see by inspection\nof Eq. (5) that, after successful loading onto the ideal\nquantum memory, the cascaded source with ideal ele-\nments will yield a unit-Fidelity Bell state loaded onto\nthe two QMs. All four of these Fidelities with j\t+i(the\noriginal and the cascaded source, with and without a\nQM) are plotted as a function of Ns, in Fig. 4. We see\nthat the cascaded source, assuming ideal elements for the\nBSM, has a superior Fidelity compared with the original\nsource. Note that the preceding analysis assumes that\nthe state generated by each `original' source is the pure\nstate given by Eq. (4). Realistic SPDC sources have an\nadditional degree of freedom w.r.t. the temporal location\nof the emitted photons.

Probability of entangled state generation,\nassuming ideal devices\nSince the cascaded source is a heralded-state genera-\ntion scheme, there is a generation probability, which we\nlabelPgen, associated with it. This corresponds to the\nprobability of the detection of a desirable click pattern\nin the BSM circuit, which is a function of Ns. Assuming\nideal PNR detectors for the BSM and no other losses,\nthis quantity is given by:\nPgen=1\n2\u0002\u0012p(1)2\n4+p(0)p(2)\n3\u0013\n=N2\ns\n(Ns+ 1)6:(10)\nPgenis plotted as a funct\nis quantity is given by:\nPgen=1\n2\u0002\u0012p(1)2\n4+p(0)p(2)\n3\u0013\n=N2\ns\n(Ns+ 1)6:(10)\nPgenis plotted as a function of Nsin Fig. 5. Here we\nnote that the approximation made to simplify the state\ndescription is only valid up to Ns\u00190:2 as plotted.\nNote that the \frst term in Eq. (10) describes the de-\nsired case where each source contributed one photon to\nthe BSM, while the second term describes the undesir-\nable case where one source produced two pairs and the\nother produced none.\nV.

The speci\fc non-idealities\nwe will consider in this section are as follows:\n1.Detector e\u000Eciency and dark clicks |The leading\ncandidates for PNR detection are the Transition\nEdge Sensor (TES) detectors [17, 45], and Su-\nperconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors\n(SNSPDs) [46, 47]. Each kind is in\ruenced by mul-\ntiple e\u000Bects that degrade their performance [45, 48].\nIn our present analysis, we will abstract o\u000B the\nnon-ideality of a PNR detector into two parame-\nters: a sub-unity detector e\u000Eciency ( \u0011d\u00141) and a\nnon-zero dark click probability ( Pd\u00150) per detec-\ntion gate (which will be assumed to be the length\nof a pulse slot for our calculations). A pictorial\nschematic of our model of this non-ideal PNR de-\ntector is given in Fig. 6. A detailed mathematical\nmodel of this two-parameter non-ideal PNR detec-\ntor is discussed in Appendix D.\n2.Coupling e\u000Eciency\nmodel of this two-parameter non-ideal PNR detec-\ntor is discussed in Appendix D.\n2.Coupling e\u000Eciency |We will also account for losses\nin coupling the `inner' output modes of the SPDCsources (ones that go into the BSM) into single-\nmode \fber. We will label the e\u000Bective e\u000Eciency of\nthis coupling, per mode, as \u0011c. Our analysis of the\nderived formulae shows (see Appendices C and F)\nthat we can combine the two e\u000Eciency parameters\ninto one e\u000Eciency parameter, \u0011\u0011\u0011c\u0011d, i.e., the\noutput state will be identical for any given value of\n\u0011, regardless of the actual values of \u0011cand\u0011d, as\nlong as their product equals \u0011.\n3.Photon Indistinguishability |The required BSM\nthat heralds the generation of the \fnal state, relies\non two-photon or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) inter-\nference to properly function. The interfering pho-\ntons from each source must therefore be completely\nindistinguishable to achieve maximum \fdelity. Any\nmismatches in the sources' spectral, temporal, or\nspatial modes will introduce distinguishability and\nreduce visibility for the interference measurement.\nThis reduced visibility in turn leads to errors in the\nBSM and degrades the \fnal output state \fdelity.\nWe present a simple model to study this behavior.\nIf the `inner output modes of the SPDC sources\nhave HOM visibility V(see Appendix B for a more\ndetailed explanation), then whenever the two pho-\ntons arrive at the central beamsplitter, this corre-\nsponds to a probability of Vthat the photons inter-\nfere perfectly, along with a probability 1 \u0000Vthat\nno interference occurs. Assuming that the \\perfect\nvisibility state has \fdelity F0with our target, then\nthe \fnal state \fdelity with visibility Vis\nF(V) =F0V+ 1=2\u0002(1\u0000V) = 1=2 + (F0\u00001=2)V:\n(11)\nThe scaling with visibility is a linear e\u000Bect, and\ncan be mitigated by improved modal matching in\nthe constituent SPDC sources that make up the\ncascaded source. In practice, care must be taken\nthat the improved mode overlap is not achieved at\nthe expense of reduced e\u000Eciency.\nFig. 6 depicts\nen\nthat the improved mode overlap is not achieved at\nthe expense of reduced e\u000Eciency.\nFig. 6 depicts the complete model with all non-\nidealities accounted for. When Pd\u003E0, the output of\nthe cascaded source is a mixed state|a statistical mix-\nture of pure states corresponding to various true click\npatterns in the detectors (several of which may not be\none of the `desirable' patterns). These terms arise be-\ncause with some probability, noisy detectors could signal\nthe presence of a photon (when in fact there isn't one),\nleading the BSM to conclude the occurrence of a desir-\nable pattern, and hence falsely declare a success. The\nmixed state, derived in full detail as per the techniques\nin Appendix C, contains the ideal-device pure state as\nin Eq.(5) along with other pure states that are gener-\nated when the apparent-desirable click pattern actually\nincludes one or more dark counts.\nDescribing the e\u000Bects of detector e\u000Eciency \u0011dis trick-\nier. In general, the e\u000Bect of \u0011d\u003C1 is equivalent to the8\ndetected modes being transmitted through a pure-loss\nbosonic channel of transmissivity \u0011dprior to being inci-\ndent on a unity-e\u000Eciency detector. Therefore, the pre-\ndetection state is a mixed state, and the \fnal density\nmatrix for the present analysis is not compactly express-\nible. Appendix C provides the detailed procedure for\nthe calculations of this mixed state and Appendix F in-\ncludes analytic formulae for the source performance met-\nrics. Below, we present plots that shows the trend of\nthe metrics under consideration, e.g., Fidelity and prob-\nability of success, as a function of Nsfor various values\nof\u0011dandPd.

MULTIPLEXED CASCADED SOURCE OF\nON-DEMAND HIGH-FIDELITY BELL STATES\nThe greatest advantage a\u000Borded by the heralding trig-\nger is that it enables multiplexing (heralded) cascaded\nsources using an array of photonic switches. The design\nreleases an entangled state based on which of the con-\nstituent sources was successful in a given time slot. Such\nmultiplexing has been shown to enable large enhance-\nments in the success probability of HSPS [31]. This con-\nstruction, using a bank of M \u003E 1 cascaded sources, with\nboth output mode pairs of each of the Msources fed into\nM-to-1 optical switch-arrays (each built out of log2M\nswitches), assisted by electronic controllers, is shown in\nFig. 1. The switching arrays output the state of one of\nthe successful cascaded sources in any time slot, assuming\none or more succeeds in that time slot. If none succeed,\nthe multiplexed source produces nothing. But the user\nof the source knows when such a failure event happens.\nIf there were no additional losses in switching, we\ncould generate the entangled state in Eq. (5) with as\nhigh a success probability as we please, by increasing M\ninde\fnitely. The probability that an ideal multiplexed\ncascaded source generates an entangled pair, Psuccess =\n1\u0000(1\u0000Pgen)M. To make the source near on-demand,\nwe would pick M\u00191=Pgen, which would ensure that\n\ns =\n1\u0000(1\u0000Pgen)M. To make the source near on-demand,\nwe would pick M\u00191=Pgen, which would ensure that\non average at least one of the cascaded sources in the\nbank would have their internal BSM declare a success.\nUnfortunately, this simple-minded seemingly inde\fnite\nincrease of Psuccess toward 1 by increasing Mdoes not\nwork when device non-idealities, especially the switching\nlosses, are accounted for. Our modeling and analysis con-\nsiders four device impairments: detection e\u000Eciency ( \u0011d),\ncoupling e\u000Eciency( \u0011c), switching e\u000Eciency( \u0011s) and dark-\nclick probability( Pd). There are two design choices for\nthe implementation of the heralded-multiplexed source:\nM(number of cascaded sources) and Ns(determined by\npump power). The performance of the source is quan-\nti\fed by the trade-o\u000B of Fidelity versus probability of\nsuccess (i.e., rate of entangled pair production).\nA. Performance evaluation of the\nheralded-multiplexed source\nWe consider a multiplexing scheme as described in the\nparagraph above (shown in Fig. 1), where multiple cas-\ncaded sources make parallel attempts to generate the\ntarget photonic state. This output photonic entangled\nstate is then loaded into a pair of ideal heralded quan-\ntum memories (shown as black boxes marked IQM). The\ndevice metrics in our model are quanti\fed by: (1) cou-\npling e\u000Eciency from the outputs of the cascaded source\n(\u0011c), (2) e\u000Eciencies of all the PNR detectors within theBSM, (\u0011d), (3) dark click probability (per qubit slot) of\neach detector in the BSM, Pd, and (4) switching losses\nper switch in the switch array, expressed as an e\u000Bective\ntransmissivity, ( \u0011s) (hence the overall e\u000Bective transmis-\nsivity being \u0011log2M\ns ). The performance of the heralded-\ncascaded source is quanti\fed by Psuccess the probability\nof success, of the multiplexed source producing an entan-\ngled pair of dual rail qubits, and the Fidelity of that state\nproduced with respect to the j\t+iBell state.\n0.9880.9900.9920.9940.9960.9981.00010-610-510-40.0010.0100.1001\u003Clat\nh respect to the j\t+iBell state.\n0.9880.9900.9920.9940.9960.9981.00010-610-510-40.0010.0100.1001\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"nRapNnPp5/H4ykdGcCPj0k2wyYs=\"\u003EAAACA3icbVDLSgNBEJyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKezmoB6DgniMYB6QLGF2tjcZMvtgpldYlhz9Aa/6B97Eqx/iD/gdTpI9aGJBQ1HVRTflJVJotO0vq7S2vrG5Vd6u7Ozu7R9UD486Ok4VhzaPZax6HtMgRQRtFCihlyhgoSeh601uZn73EZQWcfSAWQJuyEaRCARnaKTerfBNFLNhtWbX7TnoKnEKUiMFWsPq98CPeRpChFwyrfuOnaCbM4WCS5hWBqmGhPEJG0Hf0IiFoN18/u+UnhnFp0GszERI5+rvRM5CrbPQM5shw7Fe9mbiv56n2ARw6ToGV24uoiRFiPjieJBKijGdFUJ9oYCjzAxhXAnzP+VjphhHU1vFFOMs17BKOo26c1F37hu15nVRUZmckFNyThxySZrkjrRIm3AiyTN5Ia/Wk/VmvVsfi9WSVWSOyR9Ynz+EtJhw\u003C/latexit\u003EFidelity𝐵:\t𝜂=0.9;𝜂!=0.9𝐷:\t𝜂=0.9;𝜂!=0.6𝐶:\t𝜂=0.6;𝜂!=0.9𝐴:\t𝜂=0.99;𝜂!=0.99×⨀\n⊞⨀⨀\n⨀××\n×⊞⊞⊞𝐴!𝐴\"𝐴#𝐵!𝐵#𝐵\"𝐶!𝐶#𝐶\"\n𝐷!𝐷#𝐷\"SPDC∶\t𝜂=0.9\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"rpbwli2g1j2jMTGYmtd4mIQtm9o=\"\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\u003C/latexit\u003EProb. of SuccessPsuccess\nFigure 14.

For this high switching loss the envelopes monoton-\nically go lower as Mincreases. The marked points correspond\nto:Nsrequirements: Ns= 0:028 (\f);Ns= 0:05 (\u0002);Ns=\n0:09 (\u0001). The plots here assume Pd= 0.\npoint in this scatter plot represents a unique choice of M\nandNs, while the solid lines indicate the best trade-o\u000B\nthe heralded-multiplexed source can achieve, given the\ndevice metrics \u0011c,\u0011d, and\u0011s, forNs2[10\u00004;0:2] and\nM2[1;106]. Further, we have plotted the performance\ntrade-o\u000B for the stand-alone SPDC source (black dottedline) when loaded onto a quantum memory (with a cou-\npling e\u000Eciency \u0011= 0:9) that we have assumed for the\nmultiplexed cascaded approach. We note that the per-\nformance is actually quite comparable to the much more\nresource-intensive approach discussed here.\nTable I summarizes some sample M(columns) and Ns\n(bottom row) values for the marked points in Fig. 14.\nThe points give us a sense of the required multiplexing\nsize and mean photon number combinations that yield\nthe output state of desired Fidelity with a maximal prob-\nability of generation. In Figs. 15 and 16, we plot the\nenvelope of this aforesai\nith a maximal prob-\nability of generation. In Figs. 15 and 16, we plot the\nenvelope of this aforesaid trade-o\u000B for \fxed values of M\n(whileNsis varied). We note that for a given set of\ndevice metrics, there is an optimal value of Mbeyond\nwhichPsuccess cannot be increased any further. More-\nover, there are various limitations on the performance\nof the cascaded source, if the original SPDC sources are\nimperfect as discussed earlier in Section IV.\nB. E\u000Bect of switching loss on system performance\nWe note an interesting reversal in behavior when the\nswitching loss per switch (quanti\fed by \u0011s) increases be-\nyond a threshold value of 1 :5 dB (which corresponds to\n\u0011s= 1=p\n2\u00190:707). When the loss per switch is below\nthis threshold, the envelope is seen to attain its maximal\nvalue for an optimum choice of M(see Fig. 15). How-\never, when the loss per switch is higher than 29.3%, the\ntrend reverses and increasing Mis detrimental to the\nperformance of the scheme (see Fig. 16). This places a\nhard limit on the per-switch loss and the number of cas-\ncaded sources in a viable and useful implementation of\nthe cascaded-multiplexed source.\nThe intuitive reason for this reversal in the trend is\nas follows. The size of the switching array scales as\nlog2(M). Assuming switching e\u000Eciency per switch of\n\u0011s(i.e., log10(1=\u0011s) dB of switching loss per switch), the\noutput modes from a successful cascaded source undergo\nan additional loss corresponding to an e\u000Bective trans-\nmission of \u0011log2(M)\ns . Now, unlike the case with lossless\nswitches, increasing the number of cascaded sources M\nstill increases the probability of success as 1 \u0000(1\u0000Pgen)M,\nwhile simultaneously decreasing the probability that a\nsuccessful output from one of the cascaded sources would\nbe successfully loaded into the memory (because \u0011log2(M)\ns\ndecreases as Mincreases). Given MandNs, the proba-\nbility of success for a multiplexed source to successfully\ngenerate an entangled state is given by:\nPsuccess = (1\u0000(1\u0000Pgen)M)\u0002(1\u0000pj00i)2; (1\nrce to successfully\ngenerate an entangled state is given by:\nPsuccess = (1\u0000(1\u0000Pgen)M)\u0002(1\u0000pj00i)2; (12)\nwherePgenis the success probability of an individual cas-\ncaded source, and pj00iis the probability the idealized\nquantum memory (IQM) on one side of the heralded-\nmultiplexed source shown in Fig. 1 fails to load the pho-\ntonic qubit into the memory. This pj00iterm increases as\nMincreases due to compounding switching losses.

So, neither of these\nphotonic entangled sources is of use to produce high-\n\fdelity entanglement unless a heralded quantum memory\nwere available that can faithfully \flter out the vacuum\ncontribution, or it were used in an application where such\nvacuum \fltering would occur naturally in a post-selected\nfashion as a result of photon detection, e.g., in QKD.\nIt might be possible to further improve the quality of\nthe output entangled state produced by the heralded-\nmultiplexed source if we had an advanced version of the\nidealized quantum memory (IQM), wherein along with\nthe stated characteristics of the IQM in Section III, the\nIQM is additionally able to emit the stored qubit into the\nphotonic domain, encoded in the dual-rail basis. This al-\nternative design is depicted in Fig. 23. This advanced\nmemory would likely come with an additional e\u000Eciency\ncost (due to ine\u000Eciency in that storage qubit-to-photon\nreadout process).The multiplexed source we analyze in this paper\nmay \fnd application in satellite-based entanglement dis-\ntribution, quantum repeaters, resource-e\u000Ecient genera-\ntion of more complex multi-photon entangled states for\nfault-tolerant quantum computing, and quantum sensors,\namong others. We leave the performance analysis of this\nsource for speci\fc applications open for future research.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPD, CNG and SG acknowledge the National Sci-\nence Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center for\nQuantum Networks (CQN), awarded under cooperative\nagreement number 1941583, for supporting this research.\nSG additionally acknowledges support from ATA, under\na NASA-funded research consulting contract.

(4). Analysis of the complete interaction picture of the Hamiltonian which\ngoverns the dynamics of the quantum source (i.e., the weak parametric down conversion) is given in Section IA of the\noriginal work and also in [27]. We present a high-level analysis of the same source using our choice of notation.

This method preserves the probability ratio\np(1)2=(p(0)p(2)) even as Nsincreases, at the cost of overestimating each probability individually (since Eq. (A5)\nomits higher order terms that will become more relevant as Nsincreases). In Fig. 25 we plot this error, as well as the\nerrors contributed by two additional methods of normalizing the state:\n\u000FDe\fnep0(0)\u00111\u0000p(1)\u0000p(2);\n\u000FDe\fnep\u0003(2)\u00111\u0000p(0)\u0000p(1).\nThep0normalization preserves the 1- and 2-photon pair probabilities of j i, but overestimates vacuum contributions.\nSimilarly,p\u0003normalization allows for accurate representation of the vacuum and 1-photon pair terms, but all multi-\npair events are treated as having 2 pairs. These alternate normalization schemes have some advantages since they\ndo not overestimate the 1-photon pair probability. However, this comes at the cost of faster divergence and less\nconvenience when performing analytic calculations.\nAppendix B: E\u000Bects of Imperfect Photon Indistinguishability\nIn our present analysis, we assume that the down-conversion process which generates the states given by Eq. (A1a-\nA1b) emits photons in wel\n the down-conversion process which generates the states given by Eq. (A1a-\nA1b) emits photons in well de\fned modes. Thus, a cascaded source which combines two original SPDC sources\nusing a Bell state measurement (BSM), is devoid of imperfections that may in\ruence the heralded output state.\nIn practical implementations of the SPDC source, this assumption breaks down. The emitted photons can occupy\ndi\u000Berent spectral, spatial or temporal modes. Hence, they are inherently distinguishable, which reduce the interference\nvisibility factor from unity to some value V[50, 51]. The calculation of Vfor a speci\fc setup can be done by performing\nmode pro\fle tomography on the individual down-conversion processes and evaluating a mode overlap integral. The\npresent work does not consider a speci\fc system setup for the down-conversion process, hence we do not include actual\nmode overlap integral calculations in our work. Given the Vfor a speci\fc setup, we use a simple model to study the\ne\u000Bects. If the `inner output modes of the SPDC sources have a HOM visibility V, assuming that the \\perfect visibility\nstate has \fdelity F0with our target, then the \fnal state \fdelity with visibility Vis\nF(V) =F0V+ 1=2\u0002(1\u0000V) = 1=2 + (F0\u00001=2)V: (B1)16\n0.00.10.20.30.40.501020304050\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"nhsd+Dp/oLWbOKNq6dcLrNdw3Uc=\"\u003EAAACGXicbVC7TsMwFHV4lvIKMMJgUVUqS5V0AMYKFjaKRB9SG1WOe9NadZzIdpCqqAu/wQ+wwh+wIVYmfoDvwE0zQMuRLB2dc6/O9fFjzpR2nC9rZXVtfWOzsFXc3tnd27cPDlsqSiSFJo14JDs+UcCZgKZmmkMnlkBCn0PbH1/P/PYDSMUica8nMXghGQoWMEq0kfr2SYNIEoIGiW/NHCjNwsyq9MpnfbvkVJ0MeJm4OSmhHI2+/d0bRDQJQWjKiVJd14m1lxKpGeUwLfYSBTGhYzKErqHCJCsvzX4xxWWjDHAQSfOExpn6eyMloVKT0DeT5sSRWvRm4r+eL8kY9EK6Di69lIk40SDoPDxIONYRntWEB0wC1XxiCKGSmfsxHZmqqGlKFU0x7mINy6RVq7rn1dpdrVS/yisqoGN0iirIRReojm5QAzURRY/oGb2gV+vJerPerY/56IqV7xyhP7A+fwDoAKCc\u003C/latexit\u003EParameter Overestimation(%)𝑁!\"𝑝′(0)𝑝∗(0)\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"mW1IsZRkdhNd52qcEHKywlCojoU=\"\u003EAAADwXichVLLbhMxFHUzPEp4pbBBYmNIkVhFmQjRLivKgk1LkJq2UiaKPJ47iRu/ZHsI0cj8A//AFv6Hv8EzSaUmLeVaI58595xrW/e\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\u003C/latexit\u003EMean Photon NumberNs\nFigure 25. Parameter overestimation caused by various normalization schemes for the state j i.\nLet us speci\fcally consider the temporal degree of freedom for the emitted photons. A complete and rigorous\nanalysis of this e\u000Bect is beyond the scope of this work. However, as the dual-rail Bell state is the target state for the\npresent article, we examine the single-pair emission terms in the complete photonic state emitted by the SPDC (i.e.\nn1= 1 in Eq. A1a; n2= 1 in Eq. A1b).\nIt is well understood that timing walk-o\u000B between the emitted photons induces a partial decoherence in the output\nstate; this can also be understood as a frequency-dependent relative phase between the two terms in the entangled\nstate { tracing over that phase leads to e\u000Bective loss of coherence. In the basis of the single-pair emission term, the\ndensity matrix of the SPDC source resembles\n^\u001Asingle =1\n20\nB@0 0 0 0\n0 1 1\u0000\u000F0\n0 1\u0000\u000F1 0\n0 0 0 01\nCA: (B2)\nThe parameter \u000Faccounts for the decoherence of the state, where \u000F= 0 denotes the absence of any decoherence\ndue to the timing walk-o\u000B e\u000Bect. We observe that the introduction of decoherence in the state description limits\nthe maximum \fdelity achievable by the state. This can be explained by the presence of the non-zero decoherence\nparameter (in the cross t\ne state. This can be explained by the presence of the non-zero decoherence\nparameter (in the cross terms of the density matrix), which decreases the overlap with the target state j\t+i. This\nis depicted in Fig. 26, where we plot the Fidelity of the entangled state from a cascaded source w.r.t. the ideal Bell\nstatej\t+ias a function of the mean photon number ( Ns), when the underlying SPDC source state has decoherence\nvalues (\u000F) as marked in the legend. In Fig. 27 we plot the state Fidelity as a function of Ns, after the output photonic\nstate has been loaded into the ideal quantum memory (IQM).\nBased on the results of the \fgure, we can roughly derive the following empirical relation between the maximum\nachievable \fdelity (both pre- and post-loading into the IQM) as follows\nmax\nfNs;\u0011dgF(^\u001B;j\t+i) = 0:5(1\u0000\u000F) (B3a)\nmax\nfNs;\u0011dgFVON(^\u001B;j\t+i) = (1\u0000\u000F); (B3b)\nwhere ^\u001Bdenotes the density operator of the output state (we omit the complete description for brevity). Therefore,\nit is clear that given the value of \u000Ffor the underlying SPDC sources, the maximum \fdelity target for the cascaded\nsource (and in extension the multiplexed source from Section VI) is limited to 1 \u0000\u000F.17\n\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"nRapNnPp5/H4ykdGcCPj0k2wyYs=\"\u003EAAACA3icbVDLSgNBEJyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKezmoB6DgniMYB6QLGF2tjcZMvtgpldYlhz9Aa/6B97Eqx/iD/gdTpI9aGJBQ1HVRTflJVJotO0vq7S2vrG5Vd6u7Ozu7R9UD486Ok4VhzaPZax6HtMgRQRtFCihlyhgoSeh601uZn73EZQWcfSAWQJuyEaRCARnaKTerfBNFLNhtWbX7TnoKnEKUiMFWsPq98CPeRpChFwyrfuOnaCbM4WCS5hWBqmGhPEJG0Hf0IiFoN18/u+UnhnFp0GszERI5+rvRM5CrbPQM5shw7Fe9mbiv56n2ARw6ToGV24uoiRFiPjieJBKijGdFUJ9oYCjzAxhXAnzP+VjphhHU1vFFOMs17BKOo26c1F37hu15nVRUZmckFNyThxySZrkjrRIm3AiyTN5Ia/Wk/VmvVsfi9WSVWSOyR9Ynz+EtJhw\u003C/latexit\u003EFidelity𝜂!=1𝜂!=0.9𝜂!=0.7Dashed: 𝜖=0.05Dotted:  𝜖=0.1Solid:    𝜖=0\n\u003Clatexit sha1_base64=\"mW1IsZRkdhNd52qcEHKywlCojoU=\"\u003EAAADwXichVLLbhMxFHUzPEp4pbBBYmNIkVhFmQjRLivKgk1LkJq2UiaKPJ47iRu/ZHsI0cj8A//AFv6Hv8EzSaUmLeVaI58595xrW/emmjPrut0/W43ozt1797cfNB8+evzkaWvn2alVhaEwoIorc54SC5xJGDjmOJxrA0SkHM7S2WGVP/sKxjIlT9x\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\u003C/latexit\u003EMean Photon NumberNs\nFigure 26.

We assumed Pd= 0 for these plots.\nAppendix C: Hybrid Fock-Coherent System Modeling\nAlthough complete system modeling in the Fock basis is exact and complete when we truncate the in\fnite basis\nsu\u000Eciently, it poses a variety of computational di\u000Eculties. Inclusion of component e\u000Eciency involves the consideration\nof additional environment modes that need to be traced out. Treating the e\u000Bects of pure loss using the Kraus operator\nformalism is one way to circumvent this di\u000Eculty. The Fock-basis representation of the output is not well suited for\nthis treatment as account for the environment modes causes the system size to scale quickly. In our calculations we\nadopt a hybrid Fock-Coherent approach.\nThis approach treats any linear optical component that manipulates the quantum state, as well as loss in the bosonic18\nmodes, in the coherent basis. The \fnal state can then be projected onto the Fock basis to generate the complete\ndensity matrix description. We highlight the key steps to this approach in the subsequent paragraphs. The complete\ndensity matrix description of the \fnal state is omitted for brevity in this Appendix.\nWe begin by identifying that the original state from Eq. (4) is a pair of two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states.\nHence, it is conceptually much simpler to treat the complete polarization entangled source as two di\u000Berent TMSVs\nthat are connected as shown in Fi\nt the complete polarization entangled source as two di\u000Berent TMSVs\nthat are connected as shown in Fig. 24. The whole state is a tensor product of the two component states, with\nthe mode labels suitably rearranged as described in Appendix A. Experimentally, this is analogous to the two down\nconversion processes corresponding to the double-pass through the nonlinear \u001F(2)crystal with the idler modes being\nswapped using a polarizing beam splitter [28].\nGiven a single TMSV state j i=P\nmc(m)jm;mi, the corresponding density matrix is,\n\u001A=n;n0X\nm;m0=0cmc\u0003\nm0jm;mihm0;m0j: (C1)\nWe now take two such sources to model the complete SPDC source, changing the labels of their Fock state to keep\nthe indices distinct. The \fnal state is then represented as\n\u001AA\n\u001AB=X\nnA;n0\nA;nB;n0\nBcA;mAc\u0003\nA;m0\nA\u0002cB;mBc\u0003\nB;m0\nBX\nall m and m'jmA;mA;mB;mBihm0\nA;m0\nA;m0\nB;m0\nBj (C2)\n=1\n\u00194Z\n\u000Bi;\rjX\nallnandmCmA;mB;m0\nA;m0\nBjmAij\u000B1;\u000B2ih\u000B1;\u000B2jmA;mBijmBi\u0002hm0\nAjhm0\nA;m0\nBj\r1;\r2ih\r1;\r2jhm0\nBj\n(C3)\n=1\n\u00194ZX\nall sumsCmA;mB;m0\nA;m0\nBjmAij\u000B1;\u000B2ijmBihm0\nAjh\r1;\r2jhm0\nBjexp (\u0000(j\u000B1j2+j\u000B2j2+j\r1j2+j\r2j2)=2)\n\u0002\u000BmA\n1pmA!\u000BmB\n2pmB!\rm0\nA\n1p\nm0\nA!\rm0\nB\n2p\nm0\nB!: (C4)\nIn Eqs. (C3) and (C4), we project a pair of the modes on the coherent basis elements j\u000Bii;j\rijwherei;j= 1;2.\nThese two modes are the ones that get mixed and detected in the \fnal cascaded source. To account for all losses and\nthe beamsplitter interaction, one can take a pair of modes whose coherent basis kets are j\u000Biiandj\u000Bji, and carry out\nthe necessary manipulations on the coherent basis elements as,\nj\u000Bi;\u000Bji\u0011c=)j\u000Bip\u0011c;\u000Bjp\u0011ci50:50BS= = = = =)\f\f\f\f\u000Bip\u0011c+\u000Bjp\u0011cp\n2;\u0000\u000Bip\u0011A+\u000Bjp\u0011cp\n2\u001D\n\u0011d=)\f\f\f\fp\u0011d\u000Bip\u0011c+\u000Bjp\u0011cp\n2;p\u0011d\u0000\u000Bip\u0011A+\u000Bjp\u0011cp\n2\u001D\n:\n(C5)\nHere,\u0011cand\u0011daccount for the coupling and detection e\u000Eciencies respectively. Hence the complete interaction that\ngenerates the heralded state from the cascaded source, can be summarized as\n(\u001AA\n\u001AB)\n2= \u0016\u001Aloss+BSM= = = = = =)~\u001Adet.= =)~\u001Bi; (C6)\nwhere ~\u001Biis the output state conditioned on a certain click pattern as given in the main text. Note that ~ \u001Bi\nis the output state conditioned on a certain click pattern as given in the main text. Note that ~ \u001Biis expressed\nin a mixed basis (part Fock and part Coherent). In order to get back to the Fock-basis density matrix, we adopt the\ntechniques developed in [52] to perform a Fock projection on the coherent basis description of the quantum state of\na bosonic mode.\nPerforming the preceding mathematical operations on the \fnal density matrix lets us evaluate the various metrics\nof interest:\n1. Calculating Tr(~ \u001Bi) yields the generation probability ( Pgen).\n2. The Fidelity can be determined as follows:\nF=h\t+j~\u001Bij\t+i\nTr(~\u001Bi): (C7)19\nAppendix D: Modeling a Practical Photon-Number Resolving Detector\nPhoton-number resolving (PNR) detectors [45, 47, 48] are key components of the linear optical Bell state measure-\nment(BSM) circuit, heralding the outcome of an entanglement swap attempt. When swapping entanglement between\ntwo ideal dual-rail basis Bell pairs, only speci\fc click patterns across the multiple detectors indicates a possible `suc-\ncess'. In our proposal for the improved source, this `success' information heralds the generation of the state given in\nEq.(5).\nTheoretically, the ideal PNR measurement is a projective measurement given by the action of POVM elements\n\u0005n=jnihnj;n2Z+, on the input state, say j i. A measurement result of kclicks, would collapse the input state\nonto one of the Fock basis elements, in this case jki. One can use ideal PNR detectors repeatedly to determine the\nphoton statistics of the input state and `reconstruct' the state (this is the whole focus of quantum state tomography).\nThis simple model is shown in Fig.28.\n(𝑛)Ideal PNR Detector(𝑛): Number of clicksMeasurement Projectors: \t𝑛𝑛\t};𝑛∈0,1,2…,∞\tState being detected|𝜓⟩Prob. of 𝒍clicks: 𝑙𝜓!\nFigure 28. Model of the ideal photon number resolving (PNR) detector, which generates clicks depending upon the photon\nstatistics of the input state.\nSince we consider the use of imperfect PNR detectors, there are \noton\nstatistics of the input state.\nSince we consider the use of imperfect PNR detectors, there are multiple factors that must now be taken into\naccount. Presently, we only focus on the e\u000Bects that a\u000Bect the quantum state being detected. Factors that in\ruence\nthe physical operability of the detector are not treated by this model, i.e., timing jitter, post-detection dead time,\nafter-pulsing and count saturation are not explicitly considered here (though they may be included implicitly, e.g.,\ndead time results in reduced e\u000Eciency, and afterpulsing leads to increased noise counts). We assume that the PNR\ndetector has a detection e\u000Eciency ( \u0011d) and dark click probability (uncorrelated to the input state) of Pd; and that\nthe detector is synchronized with the rest of the circuit and the pulse pro\fle, bandwidth and frequency are optimized\na priori. The detector e\u000Eciency can be interpreted as the input state being transmitted through a bosonic pure\nloss channel of transmissivity \u0011dbefore the actual detection happens, which yields an (inaccessible) outcome k. The\ndetector dark clicks can be treated as a Bernoulli random variable with probability of success Pd. The outcome of\nthis random variable is convoluted with the actual output from the ideal PNR measurement after loss. Thus, an\nobservation of l\u00151 clicks may signify one of two cases:\n\u000FThere were lclicks and no dark clicks.\n\u000FThere were l\u00001 clicks and a single dark click.\nThus, the probability of lclicks in the detector is given by\nP[l] =P[k=l\u00001]\u0002Pd+P[k=l]\u0002(1\u0000Pd): (D1)\nThe complete model of the non-ideal PNR measurement is depicted in Fig. 29.\nWe note that observation of a correct click pattern indicates a successful entanglement swap only for a small subset\nof cases. For example, an observed pattern of ~ nobserved = (1;1;0;0) may correspond to any of the following cases:\nPobserved\n(1;1;0;0)=(1\u0000Pd)4\u0002P(1;1;0;0)\n+Pd(1\u0000Pd)3\u0002[P(1;0;0;0)+P(0;1;0;0)]\n+P2\nd(1\u0000Pd)2\u0002P(0;0;0;0);(D2)\nwhereP(~ n)is the probability that in reality the \n1;0;0;0)+P(0;1;0;0)]\n+P2\nd(1\u0000Pd)2\u0002P(0;0;0;0);(D2)\nwhereP(~ n)is the probability that in reality the detection pattern was ( ~ n) prior to the dark clicks.\nIn the proposed cascaded source, if we consider only detector dark clicks (no detector loss, i.e., \u0011d= 1) we would\nobtain the following mixed state at the output,\n\u0016\u001A= (1\u0000Pd)4^\u001A1+ (1\u0000Pd)3Pd^\u001A2+ (1\u0000Pd)2P2\nd^\u001A3; (D3)20\n𝑃𝑛=𝑙=𝑃𝑘=𝑙−1×\t𝑃!\t+\t𝑃𝑘=𝑙×\t1−𝑃!;𝑙≥1𝑃[𝑛=0]=𝑃𝑘=0×(1−𝑃!);𝑙=0𝜂!(𝑘)(𝑗)𝑛=𝑘+𝑗(𝑛): Number of clicks\nEfficiency: 𝜂!∈[0,1]Dark click probability:\t𝑃!∈[0,1]𝑣𝑎𝑐𝑃𝑗=1=𝑃!;\t\t𝑃𝑗=0=1−𝑃!Non-Ideal PNR Detector with detection efficiency and dark clicks\nTrace out (no access)Bernoulli random variable; No controlProb. of 𝒍clicks:\nFigure 29.

Such a measurement is a theo-\nretical tool essential to \flter out the vacuum component of the quantum state, a major component that drives down\nthe state \fdelity. Given an N-mode quantum state j i, the VON measurement can be ideally modeled as a black box\nproducing one of two outcomes:\n\u0000theN-mode vacuum state: j 0i=j0i\nNwith a probability of pj0i\nN;\n\u0000the vacuum-subtracted quantum state from j i,j 1i=j i\u0000ppj0i\nNj0i\nN\np\n1\u0000jpj0i\nNj2with a probability of 1 \u0000pj0i\nN.\nThe probability of the vacuum outcome is given by jpj0i\nNj2=jh00:::0j ij2.

31. The complete abstraction of the cascaded source as a Gaussian Boson sampling circuit setup for state preparation.\nWe start with eight input vacuum modes, perform a unitary operation U(\u0010) (which includes the unitary for the two-mode\nsqueezers and intermediate beamsplitters) parameterized by \u0010. This corresponds to the mean photon number per mode Nsof\nthe underlying two-mode squeezed states.\nthe fact that all input states (i.e. the vacuum s\nmode Nsof\nthe underlying two-mode squeezed states.\nthe fact that all input states (i.e. the vacuum state) and quantum operations (i.e. two mode squeezing, beamsplitters\nand necessary pure-loss channels) are Gaussian in nature. PNR detection based heralding of the \fnal state is the\nonly step that introduces non Gaussianity. This means that prior to detection, quadrature displacements and the\ncovariance matrix provide a complete description of the quantum state. Ref. [52] covers the analysis of a Gaussian\nBoson sampling circuit using the coherent basis K-function.\nLet us begin with the Gaussian pure state after the unitary U(\u0010) asj 0i(marked by the red dashed line in Fig. 31).\nSince the internal beamsplitters of the circuit are balanced, we can commute all our coupling losses to manifest just\nbefore detection. This is an operational trick to keep the state description rid of di\u000Eculties with swapping mixed\nstates. This is justi\fed because coupling losses are uniform and the beamsplitters are balanced.) We can write the\nK-function of the state j 0iasK(~ \u000B) [52] as\nj 0i=1\n(2\u0019)8Z\nd16\u000BK(~ \u000B)j~ \u000Bi; (G1)\nwhere,j~ \u000Bi=j\u000B1;:::;\u000B 8iis the coherent basis vector and \u000Bi= (q\u000Bi+ip\u000Bi)=p\n2. Hereq\u000Bi;p\u000Biare the quadrature\nvariables of the ithmode as marked in Fig. 31. Similarly the density operator description of the state j 0ican be\nexpressed in terms of the K-function as,\n^\u001A0=j 0ih 0j=1\n(2\u0019)16Z\nd16\u000Bd16\f K(~ \u000B)K\u0003(~\f)j~ \u000Bih~\fj: (G2)\nWe adopt a Kraus operator-based approach (similar to Appendix C) to account for the pure loss (due to coupling\nand detection e\u000Eciency).

In the current analysis,\n1. we have a speci\fc requirement for the quantum state in the undetected modes, i.e., j\t+i;\n2. we know the `correct' detection patterns from our preliminary analysis.\nWith this knowledge, we may subsume the photon-number detection step into our Fidelity calculation. Since we know\nthat the target Bell state exists in the undetected `outer' modes (along with spurious terms), given the measurement\noutcomes from the PNRDs (say we get n1;n2;n3andn4clicks respectively), we e\u000Bectively know the 8-mode state\nthat would yield a Bell state should the intermediate 4 modes be detected. Therefore, using this insight, our simpli\fed\ntechnique for calculating the Fidelity is equivalent to evaluating the overlap:\nF(j\u0018i;^\u001A1) =h\u0018j^\u001A1j\u0018i; (G12)\nwhere\nj\u0018i=1p\n2(j1;0;n1;n2;n3;n4;0;1i+ (\u00001)m1j0;1;n1;n2;n3;n4;1;0i); (G13)\nandn1;n2;n3;n4can be any of the patterns from the table that determines the internal phase terms (refer Section II).\nThe probabilit\n patterns from the table that determines the internal phase terms (refer Section II).\nThe probability Pgento generate the state from Eq. 5 is given by Tr(\u0005 e^\u001A1), where\n\u0005e=1\n2\njn1;n2;n3;n4ihn1;n2;n3;n4j\n1\n2: (G14)\nThis simpli\fes to\nTr(\u0005e^\u001A1) =1\n(2\u0019)16Z\nd16\u000Bd16\f K(~ \u000B)K\u0003(~\f)g(~ \u000B;~\f;~ \u0011)\n\u0002h\f1p\u0011cj\u000B1p\u0011cih\f2p\u0011cj\u000B2p\u0011cih\f7p\u0011cj\u000B7p\u0011cih\f8p\u0011cj\u000B8p\u0011ci\n\u0002hn1j\u000B3p\u0011c\u0011dihn2j\u000B4p\u0011c\u0011dihn3j\u000B5p\u0011c\u0011dihn4j\u000B6p\u0011c\u0011di\n\u0002h\f3p\u0011c\u0011djn1ih\f4p\u0011c\u0011djn2ih\f5p\u0011c\u0011djn3ih\f6p\u0011c\u0011djn4i: (G15)\nWe identify two distinct types of overlap terms in the integral, that simplify as\nh\fi\u0011ij\u000Bi\u0011ii= exp\u0014\n\u0000\u00112\ni\n2\u0000\nj\u000Bij2+j\fij2\u00002\u000Bi\f\u0003\ni\u0001\u0015\n(G16)\nh\fi\u0011ijnjihnjj\u000Bi\u0011ii=\u0011nj\ni(\u000Bi\f\u0003\ni)nj\nnj!exp\u0014\n\u0000\u00112\ni\n2\u0000\nj\u000Bij2+j\fij2\u0001\u0015\n: (G17)24\nIn the present manuscript, we have su\u000Ecient evidence from the hybrid analysis in Appendix C to claim that the\ncascaded source can be e\u000Eciently operated for Ns\u003C0:2.

Satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages\nthis advantage and provides a promising direction in achieving\nlong-distance inter-continental QKD. Satellite channels, however,\ncan be highly dynamic, due to various environmental factors\nand time-of-the-day effects, leading to heterogeneous noises over\ntime. In this paper, we compare two key distillation techniques for\nsatellite-based QKD. One is the traditional non-blockwise strategy\nthat treats all the signals as a whole; the other is a blockwise\nstrategy that divides the signals into individual blocks that have\nsimilar noise characteristics and processes them independently.\nThrough extensive simulation in a wide range of settings, we\nshow trend in optimal parameter choices and when one strategy\nprovides better key generation rates than the other. Our results\nshow that the blockwise strategy can lead to up to 5%key rate\nimprovement (leading to on average 1.9×107more key bits per\nday) when considering two types of blocks, i.e., for nighttime\nand daytime, respectively. The blockwise strategy only requires\nchanges in the classical post-processing stage of QKD and can\nbe easily deployed in existing satellite systems.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum cryptography, and specifically Quantum Key Dis-\ntribu\nng satellite systems.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum cryptography, and specifically Quantum Key Dis-\ntribution (QKD), holds several promising benefits. In partic-\nular, it has the ability to achieve certain cryptographic tasks\nwithout relying on computational assumptions, unlike much\nof our current-day secure communication infrastructure based\non public key systems [1]–[3]. However, several challenges\nremain, limiting its effectiveness and the rate of adoption of\nthis technology. One challenge is that long distance quantum\ncommunication links are required, while greater key genera-\ntion rates are necessary to allow for either faster refreshing of\nAES keys or, hopefully, the ability to stream a true one-time-\npad at a rate fast enough to keep up with the communication\nstream. Due to the exponential loss in fiber channels [4], [5],\nmany researchers are turning to the study of satellite-based\nquantum communication to solve this long-distance quantum\ncommunication problem, leveraging free-space satellite com-\nmunication that has much lower loss than fiber channels. A\nsatellite can help to distribute long-range entangled pairs totwo ground stations, thus building a QKD network over much\nlonger distances than a point-to-point ground fiber network\n(without repeaters) could achieve on its own [6].\nSeveral experimental demonstrations of quantum commu-\nnication through satellites have been conducted recently [7]–\n[20], showing their technological feasibility. Despite this in-\nterest, several questions remain, especially in terms of opti-\nmizing overall QKD system performance and speed. Since\nthe hardware of these systems would be difficult to change\nafter launch, it is important to investigate what can be done\non the classical stage of the protocol, without forcing users to\ninvest or install new quantum hardware. Every QKD protocol\nconsists of two stages: a quantum communication stage and a\nclassical post-processing stage. The first is the only one that\nrequires quantum-capable har\ne and a\nclassical post-processing stage. The first is the only one that\nrequires quantum-capable hardware; the second involves only\nclassical communication and can more easily be altered than\nthe first.\nIn this work, we investigate the classical post-processing\nstage of a standard QKD protocol, specifically BB84 [21] (or,\nrather, the entanglement based version E91 [22]) in an attempt\nto maximize the performance of a satellite system, without\naltering the quantum layer of the network. Satellite channels\nshow dynamic environmental circumstances due to various\ntime and weather conditions [18], [23]–[26]. For instance,\nnighttime and daytime have different background/thermal pho-\ntons that impact the fidelity of entangled photons or their loss,\nwhile weather conditions in the atmospheric layers increase\nnoise on entangled photons. So, we must carefully consider\nthe impact of these factors on QKD. Next, it is necessary\nto determine the optimal pump power to generate the right\nentangled photon pairs and a sampling rate to estimate noise\nin the finite key analysis.\nIn this work, we compare two classical post-processing\nstrategies for satellite systems. In one instance, which we call\n“blockwise post-processing,” we divide an entire signal into\nseveral individual “blocks” and process them independently;\nthese blocks should have similar noise/loss characteristics.\nThe other strategy is the more traditional method of treatingarXiv:2307.04300v1  [quant-ph]  10 Jul 2023Fig. 1. Dual downlink based QKD from one satellite to two ground stations.\nthe entire quantum signal as a single unit and processing\naccordingly (which we call “non-blockwise post-processing”).\nFor both post-processing methods, we investigate optimal\nparameter settings for various satellite configurations and\noperating conditions.\nWe make several contributions in this work. To our knowl-\nedge, we are the first to evaluate and compare these two\ndifferent post-processing methods in both the finite key and\nasymptotic \nluate and compare these two\ndifferent post-processing methods in both the finite key and\nasymptotic scenario and under various satellite operating con-\nditions. We also conduct a rigorous evaluation of QKD satellite\noperation using extensive simulations with realistic noise and\nloss models, showing trends in optimal parameter choices\nand when, exactly, the two different post-processing methods\nshould be used to optimize overall key generation rates. For\ninstance, we show that the blockwise scheme can lead to\n5% higher key rate than the non-blockwise scheme when the\nsatellite is at a high altitude, leading to on average 1.9×107\nmore key bits per day.\nWe comment that all our investigations are on the classical\nstage of the QKD protocol, and any alterations which our\nwork suggests that may be beneficial to a satellite QKD\nsystem, can be easily adopted by the current systems, and\neasily added after a satellite’s launch. In addition, while\nfocusing on satellite-based QKD, our findings also apply to\nterrestrial QKD network scenarios where the raw key bits\nhave significant dynamics, e.g., because they are created over\ndisparate network paths.\nII. P RELIMINARIES\nA. Satellite-based QKD\nWe consider a satellite that orbits around the Earth at a\ncertain altitude. The satellite has photon sources that generate\nentangled pairs, and sends them to a pair of ground stations.\nSpecifically, for each entangled pair, the satellite transmits one\nphoton in the pair to one ground station using a down-link\noptical channel, thus creating a dual downlink entanglement\ndistribution as shown in Fig. 1. The two ground stations run\nan entanglement based protocol (e.g., E91 [22]) for QKD.\nIn the rest of this paper, we assume that the two ground sta-\ntions are located on the equator. The satellite orbits the Earth\nin a west-to-east direction above the equator, in alignment\nFig. 2. Elevation angle threshold θe: the elevation angle between the satellite\nand each ground station must exceed the threshol\nshold θe: the elevation angle between the satellite\nand each ground station must exceed the threshold θe. In the figure, rois the\norbit radius, where reis the earth radius, and his the satellite altitude.\nwith the Earth’s rotation. We focus on low-earth-orbit (LEO)\nsatellites (i.e., altitude between 250 to 2000 km) that benefit\nfrom proximity to earth surface and have been demonstrated\nexperimentally [27]–[29].\nTo transmit photons successfully to a ground station, the\nelevation angle, i.e., the angle between the satellite and the\nhorizon at the ground station, needs to exceed a threshold,\nθe. For successful delivery of an entangled pair, the elevation\nangles between the satellite and the two ground stations must\nboth exceed θe, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this figure, the sector\nbetween GiLandGiRrepresent the region where the elevation\nangle between the satellite and ground station iexceeds θe,i=\n1,2. The intersection of these two sectors is the region where\nthe satellite can transmit entanglement pairs successfully to\nboth ground stations.\nB. Entanglement Sources\nWe assume that the satellite utilizes spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) based dual-rail polarization entan-\nglement sources that are well-studied and widely used [30]–\n[32]. In such entanglement sources, a two-qubit entangled Bell\nstate requires four orthogonal modes (i.e., two pairs of mode)\nto encode. The expression of the output is a quantum state as\nfollows [32], [33]:\n\f\fφ±\u000B\n=N0\u0014p\np(0)|0,0; 0,0⟩\n+r\np(1)\n2(|1,0; 0,1⟩ ± |0,1; 1,0⟩)\n+r\np(2)\n3(|2,0; 0,2⟩ ± |1,1; 1,1⟩+|0,2; 2,0⟩)\u0015\n,\n(1)\nwhere N0is a normalization factor, namely:\nN0=1p\np(0) + p(1) + p(2)=(Ns+ 1)2\np\n6N2s+ 4Ns+ 1(2)\nandp(n)is the probability of generating a n-photon term in\neach pair of mode, given by:\np(n) = (n+ 1)Nn\ns\n(Ns+ 1)n+2, (3)where Nsispump power , i.e., the mean photon number per\nmode. The entangled pair from the SPDC dual-rail polarization\nsource is as follows:\n\f\fΨ±\u000B\n=1√\n2(|1,0; 0,1⟩ ± |0,1; 1,0⟩), (4)\nthe vacuum state \n-rail polarization\nsource is as follows:\n\f\fΨ±\u000B\n=1√\n2(|1,0; 0,1⟩ ± |0,1; 1,0⟩), (4)\nthe vacuum state is |0,0; 0,0⟩, and all the other terms are\nspurious two-photon states. In Eq. (1), we assume that Nsis\nlow (e.g., below 0.2) and hence p(n)forn \u003E2is negligible\nand is omitted in the quantum state.\nThe pump power is an important configurable parameter\nthat can be tuned to maximize the entanglement rate, while\nadhering to a desired fidelity threshold. In Section IV, we\nshow that the pump power impacts two important factors,\nsuccess probability and fidelity, for QKD, and needs to be\nchosen carefully.\nC. Loss Model\nThe satellite quantum communication channel via free space\noptical (FSO) transmission, must account for the character-\nistics of the optical channel in its underlying analysis. The\ntransmission losses for each qubit (comprising of a pair\nof modes) scales quadratically with free space propagation\nlength and exponentially with aerial propagation length [33].\nWe incorporate the effect of transmission loss by treating\nFSO transmission as a Bosonic pure loss channel acting on\neach mode of the quantum state described in Eq. (1). Most\ngenerally, the Bosonic pure loss channel leads to a reduction\nin the mean photon number of the input state; additionally\nan input pure quantum state becomes a mixed state for non-\nzero loss. In the present context, this impedes the probability\nof successfully delivering the entangled pairs to both ground\nstations, as well as affecting the fidelity (to the ideal Bell state)\nof the delivered entangled photons [33]. Namely, it changes\nthe probability of the generation of entangled pairs. The\nprobability of receiving a perfect Bell pair becomes necessarily\nsmaller than p(1)from Eq. (3). See more details of the loss\nmodel in [33].\nD. Noise Model\nAtmospheric FSO transmission channels have to contend\nwith a variety of noise processes. In this manuscript, we\nlimit our noise estimate to unfiltered background photons.\nAny excess photons in the cha\nuscript, we\nlimit our noise estimate to unfiltered background photons.\nAny excess photons in the channel will cause false events\n(i.e., where the qubits of the Bell pair were lost) to be treated\nas successes, thereby impacting the fidelity of the entangled\npair that should have been delivered. The main contributor\nof the background photon flux (for example from imperfect\nfiltering by the ground receiver) is commonly associated with\nthe brightness of the sky and varies drastically depending on\nthe time of the day. More specifically, the level of background\nphoton flux is at its highest during clear daylight, and at its\nlowest during clear nighttime. In our work, we consider these\ntwo setups (i.e., daytime and nighttime) consistent with the\nstate-of-the-art [34] and compute the fidelity of the generated\nentangled state between two ground stations by modeling thearrival of unfiltered background photons as detector dark click\nevents.\nIII. B LOCKWISE KEYDISTILLATION\nWe assume the E91 protocol [22] is used for QKD between\nthe pair of ground stations. This protocol, like most QKD\nprotocols, consists of a quantum communication stage, fol-\nlowed by a classical post-processing stage. In the quantum\ncommunication stage, Mentangled pairs are sent to Alice\nand Bob (some of which may be lost in transmission due to\nchannel loss). Alice and Bob then choose, independently at\nrandom, whether to measure their particles in the ZorXbasis,\nrecording their results. Later, Alice and Bob will disclose,\nover the authenticated classical channel, their basis choice,\ndiscarding all iterations that do not match. The resulting strings\nare called the users’ raw key . This concludes the quantum\ncommunication stage—the output is a raw key of size N-bits\n(with N≤M), which may be partially correlated (errors in\nthe channel or adversarial noise may cause errors in Alice\nand Bob’s raw key) and partially secret (Eve may have some\nnon-negligible side information on the raw key based on her\nattack). Next, \necret (Eve may have some\nnon-negligible side information on the raw key based on her\nattack). Next, the classical post-processing stage will further\nprocess the raw key to produce a secret key. First the error\nrate in the raw key is determined. After this, error correction,\nand finally privacy amplification protocols are run. The output\nof this stage is the final secret key of size ℓ≤Nbits. An\nimportant metric for the entire QKD protocol is its key rate ,\nnamely the ratio of the secret key size ( ℓ) to the total number\nof signals sent ( M).\nA. Blockwise vs. Non-blockwise Schemes\nIn this work we analyze and compare two different classical\npost-processing strategies: blockwise andnon-blockwise . The\nlatter, non-blockwise, is the traditional QKD scenario whereby\nthe raw key of Nbits is treated as a single system from\nwhich error correction and privacy amplification are run.\nThe former, blockwise, divides the raw key up into smaller\nsystems, or blocks. This division can be arbitrary, but to\npotentially provide a performance boost, each block should\nhave homogenous channel statistics (especially in terms of\nnoise—that is, while each block may have very different noise\nlevels, the raw keys within a single block should be similar).\nIn general, if there is a significant difference in the noise levels\nof the blocks, one can expect blockwise to produce a strictly\nhigher key rate due to the concavity of entropy as discussed\nbelow.\nFirst, consider the standard non-blockwise post-processing\nwhere all the raw key bits are considered together and is\nagnostic to the dynamics of the quantum channel. Specifically,\nin this strategy, a random subset of m \u003C N/ 2bits is randomly\nchosen from the set of Nbits in the raw key, and Alice and\nBob’s measurement results are used to estimate the noise of\nthe entire block, denoted as Q. This is defined to be the relative\nnumber of bit-flips in Alice and Bob’s raw key. In this work,\nwe assume the noise is modeled by a depolarizing channel\nand thus \n and Bob’s raw key. In this work,\nwe assume the noise is modeled by a depolarizing channel\nand thus (1) the noise is the same in both ZandXbases and(2) we have Q= (1−F)/2, where Fis the fidelity obtained\nusing the noise model in Section II-D.\nUnder the blockwise post-processing strategy, users break\nthe raw key into blocks of signals based on operating con-\nditions, where each block is expected to have similar noise\ncharacteristics. In our case, for simplicity, we divide the total\nraw key into two classes of blocks: one from day and one from\nnight operating conditions as it is expected that the noise in\nthe daylight will be higher than at night. However, blockwise\nprocessing can be applied to any arbitrary number of blocks,\nso long as there are a sufficient number of raw key bits in\neach block.\nMore formally, let rkA, rkB∈ {0,1}Nbe the raw key\nfor Alice and Bob, and let BA\nibe a single block such that\nrkA=BA\n1BA\n2···BA\nk(i.e., Bis the bitstring concatenation\nof each block). Similarly for rkBwhich will have the same\ndecomposition. Then, a random subset tiof size miis chosen\nfor each block Biand measurement results in that block,\nindexed by that subset, are disclosed over the authenticated\nchannel to determine the noise present in each block, denoted\nQi. Finally, error correction and privacy amplification are run\non each block separately, distilling ksecret keys s1through\nskwhich are later concatenated into a single secret key s. The\nsize of each sidepends on Qi.\nB. Key Rate Analysis\nAs the main goal of this paper is to evaluate and compare\nthe effectiveness of both blockwise and non-blockwise key\ndistillation strategies, we require a performance metric. For\nthis, we will use the key rate of the protocol, defined to be\nthe ratio of the number of final secret key bits to the total\nnumber of attempted entanglement pairs sent by the source.\nFinally, we will also consider both the asymptotic scenario,\nwhere the number of signals sent approaches infinity giving\nus upper-bo\noth the asymptotic scenario,\nwhere the number of signals sent approaches infinity giving\nus upper-bounds on the key-rates, and the more realistic finite-\nkey scenarios, where we will also have to take into account\nimperfect sampling and other imprecisions. We note that, for\nthis work, we consider idealized photon sources which may\nemit zero or one photon, but never two. That is, we set p(2) =\n0in Eq. 1. In our evaluations, p(2)is generally small under the\noptimal pump power and cannot drastically decrease the key\nrate, as we shall show in Section IV-E. However, a rigorous\nblockwise and non-blockwise analysis for multiphoton sources\nremains an interesting future challenge.\nTo compute the key rate of the protocol, both in the block-\nwise and non-blockwise cases, we turn to analysis methods\nderived in [35] which utilize entropic uncertainty [36].\nKey rate analysis for non-blockwise scheme. First consider\nthe non-blockwise case. Here, the entire raw-key is treated as a\nsingle system from which a random sample of size mis chosen\n(leaving n=N−mbits for the raw key). This sample allows\nparties to estimate the error in the entire raw key denoted\nasQ. From this, the remaining signals are run through an\nerror correction process (leaking an additional λECbits to the\nadversary). A test is then run by hashing the error corrected\nraw key and testing correctness between Alice and Bob (whichleaks log1\nϵcorbits to the adversary for user specified ϵcor).\nFinally, privacy amplification is run, outputting a secret key\nof size ℓ≤n. It is guaranteed that, conditioning on not\naborting the protocol, the final secret key system and Eve’s\nancilla (denoted as ρKE) will satisfy the following:\n1\n2\f\f\f\fρKE−I/2ℓ⊗ρE\f\f\f\f≤ϵsec,\nwhere ρEis Eve’s system. That is, the final secret key system\nwill be ϵsecclose (in trace distance) to a truly uniform random\nkey,I/2ℓ, which is also completely independent of Eve’s\nsystem ρE.\nUsing results in [35], the non-blockwise case can be shown\nto have an overall secret\nve’s\nsystem ρE.\nUsing results in [35], the non-blockwise case can be shown\nto have an overall secret key length of:\nℓnon−block =n(1−h(Q+µ))−λEC−log2\nϵ2secϵcor.(5)\nwhere ϵcoris a security parameter determining the failure rate\nof the correctness portion of the protocol (i.e., Alice and Bob\nwill have the same secret key, except with probability at most\nϵcor), and ϵsecis a security parameter determining the distance\nof the final secret key from a truly uniform random key. Above,\nλECrepresents the information leaked during error correction;\nin our evaluations, later, we simply set λEC=nh(Q+µ).\nOther realistic settings of λEC(Q) = 1 .2nh(Q)can also\nbe used. However such a setting will not significantly affect\nour results in later sections as we are primarily interested in\ncomparing blockwise to non-blockwise. Finally, µis a result\nof finite sampling effects and is set to:\nµ=s\n(n+m)(m+ 1)\nnm2ln2\nϵsec.\nThe above may be derived from standard classical sampling\narguments [35].\nKey rate analysis for blockwise scheme. In the blockwise\ncase, the setting is similar and we may again use results from\n[35] to distill each sub-block into secret keys independently,\nand then concatenate the final blockwise secret keys into a\nsingle secret key. Here, let Bibe the size of the i’th block\n(determined by the user). Now, a random subset tiof size\nmifor each block Biis chosen. As with the non-blockwise,\nthis sampling subset is used to determine the error rate in\nthe raw key, however, now, it is used only to estimate the\nerror rate in the i’th block of the raw key, denoted Qi. Error\ncorrection, a correctness test, and finally privacy amplification\nis then performed individually on each block. From this setup,\nwe can compute the secret key size of block ito be:\nℓi= (Bi−mi)(1−h(Qi+µi))−λ(i)\nEC−log2\nϵ2secϵcor,\nfrom which we have the following total secret key size:\nℓblock =kX\ni=1ni(1−h(Qi+µi))−X\niλ(i)\nEC−klog2\nϵ2secϵcor,\n(6)\nwhere kis the total number of blocks and ni=Bi−mi.\nThe value of µiis id\nλ(i)\nEC−klog2\nϵ2secϵcor,\n(6)\nwhere kis the total number of blocks and ni=Bi−mi.\nThe value of µiis identical to µabove, except replacing mwithmiandnwithBi−mi. Finally, λ(i)\nECis the amount of\ninformation leaked during error correction of block i. In our\nevaluations, we set this to λ(i)\nEC= (Bi−mi)h(Qi+µi).\nThe above values of ℓcan be used to immediately compute\nthe key rate simply by dividing by the number of attempted\nentanglement pairs sent by the satellite (we say attempted\nas the satellite may send out vacuum states which count,\ndetrimentally, to the overall key rate).\nTo determine theoretical upper-bounds, we also consider the\nasymptotic scenario, where the number of signals approaches\ninfinity. In this instance, the key rate for the non-blockwise\nscheme is simply 1−2h(Q), while the key rate for the\nblockwise scheme converges toP\nipi(1−2h(Qi)), where pi\nis the proportion of total raw keybits used in block ias the\nsize of the raw key approaches infinity.\nNote that the above equations give immediate intuition as\nto why blockwise processing can lead to higher key-rates. For\nnon-blockwise, the total error Qis actually the average error\nover all individual blocks. Due to the concavity of Shannon\nentropy, the key rate can only be higher, but no less than, the\nblockwise processing, at least in the asymptotic scenario. In\nthe finite key scenario, sampling imprecisions lead to other\nproblems and, so, as we show later blockwise processing can\nactually lead to worse results in some settings. Knowing when\nto use blockwise processing and when to use non-blockwise\nis an important question to answer if these systems are to be\npractically deployed.\nIV. P ERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of blockwise\nand non-blockwise key distillation schemes. As mentioned in\nSection II-A, we consider a LEO satellite, with two ground\nstations on the equator. In the following, we first describe the\nevaluation setup and then the results.\nA. Evaluation Setup\nWe con\ne following, we first describe the\nevaluation setup and then the results.\nA. Evaluation Setup\nWe consider three satellite altitudes, A= 500 km, 800 km,\n1000 km. For each satellite altitude, we consider two ground\nstations along the equator of the Earth, with a distance of D=\n600km, 1200 km, or 1800 km. The satellite is equipped with a\nSPDC entanglement source (see Section II-B) that operates at a\n1 GHz rate, i.e., generating 109entangled photons per second.\nThe elevation angle threshold (Section II-A) is set to 20◦. For\nsimplicity, we assume 10 hours of nighttime (8pm-6am), and\nthe remaining 14 hours as daytime each day. The dark click\nprobability Pdis set to 3×10−6for nighttime and 3×10−3\nfor daytime based on the study in [18]. The blockwise scheme\ntreats the raw key bits produced during daytime and nighttime\nseparately, i.e., it considers two types of blocks, corresponding\nto the raw keys from daytime and nighttime respectively, while\nthe non-blockwise scheme considers all of the raw key bits\ntogether.\nWhen the satellite altitude is 500 km, the orbit time (the\namount of time for a satellite to finish one orbit) is 5,647\nseconds, for satellite altitudes of 800 and 1000 km, the orbit\ntime is longer (6,022 and 6,276 seconds, respectively). TheTABLE I\nSATELLITE CONTACT LENGTH (SECONDS )WITH GROUND STATIONS .\nD= 600 km D= 1200 km D= 1800 km\nA= 500 km 224 134 43\nA= 800 km 385 288 190\nA= 1000 km 488 387 285\nnumber of passes of the satellite over the two ground stations\nis 6 passes during nighttime and 9 passes during daytime for\nall the settings, except when the satellite altitude is 500 km,\nwhere the number of passes during nighttime is 7. Table I\nlists the contact length (i.e., pass duration, the duration that\nthe satellite is in the contact of both ground stations) for the\nvarious settings. The contact length varies from less than 1\nminute to over 8 minutes. As expected, for a given satellite\naltitude, larger ground station distance leads to shorter contact\nlength; wh\n, for a given satellite\naltitude, larger ground station distance leads to shorter contact\nlength; while for the same ground station distance, higher\nsatellite altitude leads to longer contact length. Using the\nloss and noise models in Section II, we obtain the success\nprobability and fidelity of the transmission from the satellite\nto each ground station in each second, and then obtain the\naverage success probability and fidelity over the contact length\nin the following evaluation.\nWe consider the key rate for running the protocol over 1 to\n80 days to show the performance of the two key distillation\nschemes over time as more raw key bits are accumulated at\nthe ground stations, and the performance of these schemes\nrelative to the asymptotic results. For both blockwise and non-\nblockwise schemes, we vary the pump power of the SPDC\nsource (see Section II-B) and the sampling rate for each\nsetting so that the number of secret key bits is maximized.\nSpecifically, the pump power is varied from 0 to 0.1. We\nlimit the pump power up to 0.1 so that the approximation of\nthe quantum states in §II-B is accurate and high-order-photon\ncontributions are negligible [37]. The sampling rate is varied\nfrom 5×10−4/kto3×10−1/kfor the raw keys generated\ninkdays.\nUnless otherwise stated, our results below assume that p(2),\ni.e., the probability of generating a 2-photon term in each pair\nof mode of the SPDC source, is zero (see Section III-B). In\nSection IV-E, we show that this is a reasonable approximation.\nB. Impact of Pump Power\nWe first examine the impact of the pump power on the\nsuccess probability and fidelity in the various settings. Fig. 3\nplots the success probability and fidelity as a function of pump\npower when the satellite altitude A= 500 km. Figures 3(a)\nand (b) show the results for nighttime, where the results for\nvarious ground station distances are shown in the figure. We\nsee that, for all three ground station distances, success prob-\nability increases with pump power, while \nhat, for all three ground station distances, success prob-\nability increases with pump power, while fidelity decreases\nwith pump power. In addition, for the same pump power,\na shorter ground station distance leads to a larger success\nprobability, but lower fidelity. Figures 3(c) and (d) show the\nresults for daytime. In this case, while we see similar trend(a) Success prob., night\n (b) Fidelity, night\n(c) Success prob., day\n (d) Fidelity, day\nFig. 3. Impact of pump power on success probability and fidelity,\nsatellite altitude A= 500 km.\nfor success probability as that for nighttime, the relationship\nbetween fidelity and pump power is more complex: fidelity\nfirst increases and then decreases with the pump power. In\naddition, for the same pump power, while a shorter ground\nstation distance again leads to higher success probability as\nthat in nighttime, it leads to higher fidelity in daytime, opposite\nto the observation in nighttime.\nResults for the other two satellite altitudes (800 and 1000\nkm) show similar trends, with variations in the relative\nrelationship among the three ground station distances. For\ninstance, when A= 1000 km, for the same pump power, the\nfidelity for the three ground station distances is very close to\neach other during nighttime, while the fidelity for D= 1200\nkm is larger than that for D= 600 km, followed by that of\nD= 1800 km.\nC. Optimal Pump Power and Sampling Rate\nSince secret key rate is affected by both success probability\nand fidelity, while these two factors are affected by pump\npower in roughly opposite ways as shown above, we need\nto find the optimal pump power to maximize the secret\nkey generation rate for various settings. The optimal pump\npower hence may differ, depending on satellite altitude, ground\nstation distance, nighttime versus daytime, and also the key\ndistillation scheme. In addition, as shown in Eq. (5) and\nEq. (6), secret key rate is also affected by sampling rate. In\nthe following, we show the optimal pump power and samp\ney rate is also affected by sampling rate. In\nthe following, we show the optimal pump power and sampling\nrate for the various settings for key generation in one day; the\nresults for multiple days are deferred to Section IV-D.\n1) Blockwise Scheme: Fig. 4 plots results for the blockwise\ndistillation scheme. Specifically, Fig. 4(a) shows the optimal\npump power for various combinations of satellite altitude andground station distance; results for both nighttime and daytime\nare plotted in the figure. For the same satellite altitude and\nground station distance, we see the optimal pump power for\nnighttime is larger than that for daytime. Specifically, for\nsatellite altitude of 800 and 1000 km, the optimal pump power\nfor nighttime is 0.1, the maximum pump power that is allowed,\nand for satellite altitude of 500 km, the optimal pump power\nis close or equal to 0.1. For daytime, under the same ground\nstation distance, the optimal pump power is lower for higher\nsatellite altitude. As a special case, when the ground station\ndistance is 1800 km, the optimal pump power for daytime is\n0 when the satellite altitude is 1000 km, since no key can be\ngenerated for any values of the range of pump power.\nFigures 4(b) and (c) plot the success probability and fidelity\nunder the optimal pump power for the various settings. For\nthe same satellite altitude and ground station distance, the\nsuccess probability and fidelity for nighttime are both larger\nthan their corresponding values for daytime. In addition, for\nthe same ground station distance, the success probability under\nthe optimal pump power for lower satellite altitude tends to\nbe larger, for both nighttime and daytime. For fidelity, the\noptimal fidelity is similar for all nighttime settings, while for\ndaytime, lower satellite altitude tends to have higher fidelity\nfor the same ground station distance. When the ground station\ndistance is 1800 km and the satellite altitude is 1000 km, both\nthe success probability and fidelity are 0, since\n800 km and the satellite altitude is 1000 km, both\nthe success probability and fidelity are 0, since the optimal\npump power for that case is 0.\nFig. 4(d) plots the optimal sampling rate for the various\nsettings. The optimal sampling rate varies from 0.0075 to\n0.1045, with higher optimal sampling rate for daytime than\nnighttime under the same satellite altitude and ground station\ndistance. For a given satellite altitude, larger ground station\ndistances tend to require higher optimal sampling rates.\nFig. 5 plots the number of secret key bits generated over\ndaytime and nighttime in a day for the various settings. For\neach satellite altitude, the number of secret keys generated\ndecreases with ground station distance for both nighttime and\ndaytime, except for a satellite altitude of 1000 km during\ndaytime. For the same ground station distance, lower satellite\naltitude tends to lead to more secret keys, except for one case\n(satellite altitude of 500 km and ground station distance of\n1800km), which leads to fewer key bits than the satellite\naltitude of 800 km due to the significantly shorter contact\nlength in this scenario than others (see Table I).\n2) Non-blockwise Scheme: Fig. 6 plots the results for the\nnon-blockwise scheme. For various settings, the optimal pump\npower in Fig. 6(a) is similar to that under the blockwise\nscheme, except that when the satellite altitude A= 1000 km,\nthe optimal pump power for daytime is 0 for all ground station\ndistances. This is because the fidelity in the daytime is low\nfor all the pump power values, which leads to higher average\nerror rate (across nighttime and daytime), and overall lower\nnumber of keys, compared to the case when only generating\nkeys at nighttime. Fig. 6(b) and (c) plot the resultant success\nprobability and fidelity for the various settings with the optimal\npump power. They are similar to those for the blockwise(a) Optimal pump power\n (b) Success prob.\n (c) Fidelity\n (d) Optimal sampling rate\nFig. 4.

Fig. 6(d) plots the optimal sampling rate, which is\nin the range of 0.0065 and0.0245 . Similar to that of the\nblockwise case, for a given satellite altitude, larger ground\nstation distances have higher optimal sampling rates.\nFig. 7 plots the number of secret key bits generated using the\nnon-blockwise scheme in a day for the various settings. Since\nthis scheme combines the raw keys generated during nighttime\nand daytime together, we simply plot the overall number of\nkeys over a day. For the same ground station distance, more\nkeys are generated at lower satellite altitude, except for one\ncase, the satellite altitude is 500 km and the ground station\ndistance is 1000 km, due to its significantly shorter contact\nlength than other settings (see Table I).\nD. Compring Blockwise and Non-blockwise Schemes\nWe now compare the key rate of the blockwise and non-\nblockwise schemes. Specifically, we assume that the schemes\nrun over kdays, and set kto 1, 20, 40, 60, and 80. For each\nk, we again select the pump power and the sampling rate to\nmaximize the number of secret keys generated over kdays.\nWe see that the optimal pump power for kdays is similar\nto that of one day for both the blockwise and non-blockwise\nschemes (figure omitted).\nFigures 8(a)-(c) plot the key rate under the blockwise\nscheme when the satellite altitude is 500, 800, and 1000 km,\nrespectively. In each plot, we show results for both the finiteand asymptotic scenarios. We see that for the key rate for\nthe finite scenario increases with the number of days, and\napproaches the asymptotic result when k≥20.\nWe define (rb−rnb)/rnbas \ns with the number of days, and\napproaches the asymptotic result when k≥20.\nWe define (rb−rnb)/rnbas the relative key rate difference\nbetween the blockwise and non-blockwise schemes, where rb\nandrnbare the key rate of the blockwise and non-blockwise\nschemes for the finite scenario, respectively. Fig. 9 plot the\nrelative key rate difference for the various settings. We see\nthat the difference is larger than 0 for all the cases when the\nsatellite altitude is 800and1000 km, i.e., the blockwise outper-\nforms the non-blockwise scheme. Specifically, the blockwise\nscheme leads up to 4% and 5% improvements when the\nsatellite altitude is 800 km and 1000 km, respectively. When\nthe satellite altitude is 500 km, we see up to 1% difference\nbetween these two schemes, and the blockwise scheme leads\nto slightly lower key rate in some settings ( D= 600 and 1200\nkm and when the number of days is small). We only see four\ncases where the blockwise strategy leads to fewer key bits than\nthe non-blockwise strategy: A= 500 km and D= 600 , 1200\nor 1800 km, k= 1 day; and when A= 500 km,D= 1200\nkm, and k= 20 days.\nLet¯ℓblock and¯ℓnon−block represent the average number\nof key bits generated per day for the blockwise and non-\nblockwise strategies, respectively. Table II shows ¯ℓblock−\n¯ℓnon−block, where both quantities are obtained from the results\nof 80 days (i.e., the number of secret keys generated over 80\ndays divided by 80). We see that the blockwise strategy leads\nto106to1.9×107more keys per day in the various settings,\nexcept for one setting ( A= 1000 km and D= 1800 km)\nsince no key is generated during daytime for both strategies.\nSummarizing the the results in Fig. 9 and Table II, we see\nthat the blockwise strategy in general leads to higher key rate\nand more key bits except for the scenarios with low satellite\naltitudes and small number of days. Therefore, it is in general\nmore advantageous to use the blockwise strategy, which can\nbe easily deployed since it is only used in the classica\nus to use the blockwise strategy, which can\nbe easily deployed since it is only used in the classical post-\nprocessing stage of QKD.\nE. Handling Spurious 2-photon Terms\nRecall that p(2)in Eq. (1) is the probability of generating\na 2-photon term in each pair of mode.

Specifically, when two photons (instead of one\nphoton in an entanglement pair) are sent from the satellite to\na ground station, an adversary can keep one photon and sends\nthe other to the ground station, and hence knows the state at\nthe ground station. So far, we have ignored p(2)for ease of\nanalysis. To investigate the impact of this approximation on\nour results, we simulate a hypothetical idealistic entanglement\nsource, where either vaccuum state or entanglement pairs are\ngenerated, i.e., we normalize p(0)andp(1)asp(0)/(1−p(2))\nandp(1)/(1−p(2)), respectively, and then set p(2) = 0 . After\nthat, the simulation of loss and noise on the entanglement\npairs follows the models in Section II. Then for the optimal\npump power chosen in Section IV-C, we compare the resultant\nsuccess probability and fidelity of this idealistic source with\nthose of the actual SPDC source we use. We observe that these\ntwo sources have similar success probabilities in all settings\n(the difference is within 0.001). For fidelity, although their\ndifferences a\nilities in all settings\n(the difference is within 0.001). For fidelity, although their\ndifferences are small (within 0.01) in most cases, the differencecan be large (0.03) when the satellite altitude is 500 km and\nthe ground station distance is 600 km. Further exploration on\nsuch cases is left as future work.\nV. R ELATED WORK\nSatellite-based quantum communication provides a promis-\ning direction for global-scale QKD [7]–[14], [39], [40]. A\nrecent study [41] explores the finite key effect in satellite-\nbased QKD. It considers a satellite communicating with a\nsingle ground station, instead of entanglement-based QKD\nwhere a satellite transmits entanglement pairs to a pair of\nground station simultaneously as in this study. In addition,\nit concatenates all the data together, i.e., it only considers the\nnon-blockwise strategy, while our study compares blockwise\nand non-blockwise strategies. The authors use the finite key\nanalysis techniques proposed in [42]–[44]. We derive our finite\nkey results based on [35]. In particular, that reference provides\ntight key-rate bounds, using entropic uncertainty, when pro-\ncessing a raw key into a secret key. Typically this method is\nused directly for the non-blockwise scenario which is usually\nconsidered in QKD research. We also use their methods in our\nwork to analyze the amount of secret key material in smaller\nblocks, running privacy amplification independently on each\nblock and, thus, using results in [35] to determine the size of\nthe secret key derived from each (smaller) block. It would be\ninteresting future work to see if one could bound the quantum\nmin entropy of each sub-block directly and run a single privacy\namplification processes over the entire block. That is, use\na single invocation of privacy amplification, as in the non-\nblockwise strategy, yet still retain the benefit of increased key\nlengths as in blockwise postprocessing. The loss and noise\nmodels in this paper are based on those in [33], and we extend\nits noise mod\ning. The loss and noise\nmodels in this paper are based on those in [33], and we extend\nits noise model by considering unfiltered background photons.\nThe focus of [33] is on optimal scheduling of satellite to\nground station transmissions with a constellation of satellites.\nThis work focuses on comparing blockwise and non-blockwise\nkey distillation in satellite-based QKD.\nVI. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we compare blockwise and non-blockwise\nkey distillation strategies for satellite-based QKD, where the\nsatellite quantum channel is highly dynamic and hence can(a)A= 500 km\n (b)A= 800 km\n (c)A= 1000 km\nFig. 8.

Relative key rate difference between the blockwise and non-blockwise schemes.\nproduce raw key blocks with significantly difference char-\nacteristics. Using extensive simulation, we show that the\nblockwise strategy can lead to a 5% higher secret key rate\nthan the traditional non-blockwise strategy that is agnostic to\nthe dynamics of the quantum channel.\nAs future work, we will consider scenarios with multiple\nsatellites in a constellation and multiple ground station pairs.\nWe will also consider more factors when modeling quantum\nsatellite channels (e.g., weather conditions, cloud coverage).\nIn addition, we will consider more blocks based on time of\nthe day (e.g., sunset, night, sunrise, noon).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported in part by the NSF grant CNS-\n1955744, NSF-ERC Center for Quantum Networks grant EEC-\n1941583, MURI ARO Grant W911NF2110325, and NSF\nCCF-2143644.\nREFERENCES\n[1] V .

While global link\nstate knowledge is required to maximize the rate of entanglement generation between any two consumers,\nit increases the protocol latency due to the classical communication requirements and necessitates long\nquantum memory coherence times. We propose two entanglement routing protocols that require only\nlocal link state knowledge to relax the quantum memory coherence time requirements and reduce the\nprotocol latency. These protocols utilize multi-path routing protocol andtime multiplexed repeaters . The\ntime multiplexed repeaters first generate links for ktime steps before performing BSMs on any pairs of\nlinks. Our two protocols differ in the decision rule used for performing BSMs at the repeater; The first\nis a static path based routing protocol and the second is a dynamic distance based routing protocol. The\nperformance of these protocols depends on the quantum network topology and the consumers’ locations.\nWe observe that the average entanglement rate and the latency increase with the time multiplexing block\nlength, k, irrespective\n entanglement rate and the latency increase with the time multiplexing block\nlength, k, irrespective of the protocol. When a step function memory decoherence model is introduced such\nthat qubits are held in the quantum memory for an exponentially distributed time with mean µ, an optimal k\n(kopt) value appears, such that for increasing kbeyond kopthurts the entanglement rate. koptdecreases with\npand increases with µ.koptappears due to the tradeoff between benefits from time multiplexing and the\nincreased likelihood of previously established Bell pairs decohering due to finite memory coherence times.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQUANTUM networks will have the ability to gener-\nate, distribute, and process quantum information along\nwith classical data. These networks will connect quantum\ncomputers, sensors, simulators, and other quantum equipped\ndevices, and enable consumers to share entangled connec-\ntions on demand over potentially large distances. There are\nvarious applications for entangled qubits shared over quan-\ntum networks, such as provably-secure communication [1],\n[2], entanglement-enhanced sensing [3]–[7], and distributed\nquantum computing [8]. To enable these, it is important\nto be able to reliably and quickly transmit quantum bits\nfrom one point in a network to another in order to establish\nentanglement between distant users.\nA quantum network is comprised of two main compo-\nnents: nodes , which are equipped with entanglement sources,\nquantum memories, quantum processors, and the ability to\nclassically communicate, and edges , which connect neigh-\nboring nodes via channels that transmit entangled (typi-\ncally photonic) qubits, such as optical fibers. The nodescan be consumers wanting to utilize entanglement for some\napplication or quantum repeaters, which are fundamental\nfor the successful distribution of entanglement across large\ndistances. The rate that entangled photons can be delivered\nacross an optical fiber decays exponentially with the distance\nbetween communic\nons can be delivered\nacross an optical fiber decays exponentially with the distance\nbetween communicating parties [9]. However, when utilizing\nthese intermediate nodes, the magnitude of the exponent\ncan be decreased by breaking up the total distance between\nconsumers, which helps to mitigate the loss incurred from the\ntransmitting medium [10]–[13].\nQuantum links are maximally-entangled two-qubit states\ncalled Bell states shared along edges when two neighboring\nnodes each successfully store one half of a Bell pair in\ntheir quantum memories. The generation of these links has\na probability pof succeeding. This value is determined by\nthe actual physical hardware and encompasses optical loss\nof the link, as well as detector and memory inefficiencies.\nRepeaters in this paper are quantum switches [12], [14],\nwhich can simultaneously attempt to form entangled links\nwith neighboring nodes and dynamically choose on which\n1arXiv:2308.15028v3  [quant-ph]  28 Mar 2024Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nFIGURE 1: A snapshot of the distance-based routing pro-\ntocol on a 3x3 grid network for k= 3. The outcomes of\nthe external phase are all depicted, while the center repeater\nnode highlights the decisions made during the internal phase.\nThe repeater node labeled vis the neighbor that shares a Bell\npair with the center node, that is closest to Alice, while both\nof the nodes labeled ware closest to Bob. Although only\nthe decisions of the center node are shown here, all repeater\nnodes are simultaneously making swapping decisions.\nlinks to perform entanglement swaps by using local network\ninformation. A swap is most commonly implemented by\nperforming a Bell state measurement (BSM) on qubits held\nwithin a repeater with a probability of success denoted by q.\nIf successful, this results in the corresponding qubits held at\nthe repeater’s neighbors to become entangled. However, if the\nmeasurement fails, both of the Bell states the repeater\nighbors to become entangled. However, if the\nmeasurement fails, both of the Bell states the repeater shared\nwith its neighbors are lost.\nIncreasing the rate of entanglement distribution for net-\nworks under different constraints is crucial to the usefulness\nof quantum networks. The probabilistic nature of link genera-\ntion means that different links will be present or absent when\nthe network is observed at different instances in time. We\nrefer to each such network state observation as a \"snapshot\".\nGlobal link state knowledge is needed by a protocol to ensure\nthat two consumers, Alice and Bob, share the maximum num-\nber of Bell pairs possible given the initial snapshot. However,\nglobal link state knowledge is often not possible as quantum\nnetworks can spread out across large distances giving rise\nto large latencies due to classical communication. Quantum\nmemories cannot support this condition as they have very\nshort storage lifetimes. Routing protocols have been pro-\nposed to lower latency and therefore the requirements on\nquantum memories by creating virtual graphs of entangled\nlinks before or at the time consumers request entangled pairs\n[15], [16]. To further reduce this latency, [17] created a\nprotocol that combined local link state knowledge andmulti-\npath routing to distribute Bell pairs to consumers. It was seen\nto provide rates larger than those achievable by a single linear\nrepeater chain and only required that each repeater knew the\nphysical topology of the network and the outcomes of theirown entanglement generation attempts. Further exploration\nof distance-based routing schemes can be found in [18]–[20].\nDistillation protocols and routing were analyzed in [21] to\nmaximize the distillable entanglement between consumers.\nWhen quantum repeaters are equipped with the ability\nto perform GHZ-projective measurements, which result in\nmultipartite entangled states, the rate of entanglement distri-\nbution becomes distance independent under a certain range of\npandq\n the rate of entanglement distri-\nbution becomes distance independent under a certain range of\npandqvalues, in contrast with the typical exponential decay\nobserved with distance [22]. Further improved multipartite\nentanglement distribution schemes can be found in [23], [24].\nTime multiplexed link generation is currently being ex-\nplored to increase the rate of distribution of entangled qubits.\nIt has recently been shown that time-multiplexed repeater\nnodes, equipped with the ability to perform BSMs across\ndifferent time steps, allow for a sub-exponential decay with\ndistance [25]. This result is otherwise unattainable with\njust spatial or spectral multiplexing. Time multiplexing has\nalso been combined with GHZ-projective measurements, and\nit has been shown that distance independent rates can be\nachieved over larger region in the p-qspace than that without\nmultiplexing [26].\nIn this paper, we combine the benefits of multipath rout-\ning and local link state knowledge with time-multiplexed\nrepeaters to further improve the rate of entanglement dis-\ntribution. These time multiplexed repeater nodes are able to\nhold onto multiple links before routing decisions are made.\nThis increases the likelihood that two repeaters are connected\nand the number of end-to-end links consumers can generate.\nWe develop two pragmatic routing protocols assuming the\nrepeaters know the network topology and have local-link\nstate knowledge. The static protocol uses fixed path routing.\nIt predetermines the pair of neighbors (if any) a repeater\nconnects by performing BSMs. The dynamic protocol , on the\nother hand, uses distance-based metrics to decide which pairs\nof neighbors are connected via BSMs at a repeater.\nBoth protocols are presented in Section II. In Section\nIII, we will evaluate these protocols on networks where\nmemories have infinite coherence time; in this case, time\nmultiplexing only serves to improve the average rate of the\ndistribution of Bell pairs. We discuss the impact that quantum\n\ns to improve the average rate of the\ndistribution of Bell pairs. We discuss the impact that quantum\nnetwork structure, as well as location of consumers, have on\nthe performance on both of our protocols. In Section IV we\nreduce the coherence time of our quantum memories, and\nshow that there exists an optimal amount of time multiplexing\ndependent on the conditions of the network. Last, we offer\nconcluding thoughts in Section V and comment on future\ndirections.\nII. PROTOCOL DESIGN: MULTI-PATH ROUTING WITH\nTIME MULTIPLEXED REPEATERS\nWe propose an algorithm that combines local link state\nknowledge and multi-path routing with time multiplexed\nrepeaters. The proposed protocol can be divided into two\nphases.\n2Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nThe External Phase\nis the first phase, which lasts for ktimesteps, where kis the\ntime multiplexing block length. These timesteps are of length\nτseconds. In each timestep, an attempt is made to generate\na pair of entangled qubits between neighboring repeaters\nalong all edges. (In the case where the network has a grid\ntopology, each node attempts this ktimes with each of its four\nneighbors.) The probability that the initial link generation\nsucceeds is denoted by p. We will refer to the network state\nafter this phase as a snapshot.\nThe heralding of the initial success/failure of these Bell\npairs is received by neighbors L/cseconds after the entangle-\nment is attempted, where Lis the distance between neighbors\nandcis the speed of light. This initial latency between the\ncreation of the Bell pair and when the pair can actually\nbe utilized exists even when there is no time multiplexing.\nFor this paper, we will assume that each repeater node has\nquantum memory buffer greater than ⌈L/cτ⌉+kper edge to\naccommodate this latency as well as that which arises from\nthe time multiplexing. Although this work does not specify\na specific type of architecture for the network, the quality\nof entanglemen\nis work does not specify\na specific type of architecture for the network, the quality\nof entanglement may degrade during this time. This paper\nemploys the step-function decoherence model used in [26]–\n[28] where qubits are held perfectly in memory until some\nrandom time, drawn from an exponential distribution with\nmean lifetime µ, after which the entanglement is discarded.\nIt is assumed that repeaters know when entanglement is\ndiscarded, so that the remaining entanglement in the network\nis not lost. This model is a conservative approximation for\nmemory architectures that have exponentially decaying qubit\nfidelities with measurable time constants, such as trapped\nions and color centers [29]. Initially, we will set µ=∞. This\ncondition will later be relaxed, so that not all the original Bell\npairs are recoverable after waiting the additional kτseconds.\nThe Internal Phase\nis the second phase in which entanglement swaps are at-\ntempted within each repeater node with success probability\nq. It is assumed that this process is instantaneous when\ncompared to the first phase. Repeaters can choose different\npairs of successful links to connect depending on the protocol\nbeing used. This paper investigates two different categories\nof protocols: static anddynamic .\nStatic refers to a fixed path routing protocol that is pre-\ndetermined based on the physical structure of the underly-\ning network. Let θbe the number of edge disjoint paths\nconnecting consumers. In the case of regular lattices, this is\nequivalent to the node degree. A greedy algorithm is used\nto find the first θedge disjoint shortest paths between con-\nsumers, Alice and Bob. This information is communicated to\nthe repeaters along these paths, and only connections along\nthese paths will be made. In order to most efficiently use\nany successfully generated entangled links along edges, a\npredetermined ordering can be used to maximize the number\nof Bell pairs at the end. An example of this would be an\nordering based on the \n maximize the number\nof Bell pairs at the end. An example of this would be an\nordering based on the time slot the links were successfullycreated, and performing BSMs on the most recent ones on\neach edge.\nDynamic has also be referred to as distance based routing,\nwhere all repeater nodes simultaneously choose which inter-\nnal swaps to make using their knowledge of the successful\noutcomes of the first phase, along with knowledge of their\nneighbors’ relative distances from the consumers, Alice and\nBob. A further explanation of this process is described below,\nand pseudo-code formulation is included in Appendix A.\nDistance Based Routing:\nLetnbe the current node and let sbe the number of\nsuccessful external links at nthat have not been swapped yet.\nAs long as there are s \u003E1successful links remaining, swaps\ncontinue to occur. Out of the neighbors that are successfully\nconnected to node n, letvbe the neighbor closest to Alice and\ndefine their relative distance to be dAv. Letwbe the neighbor\nclosest to Bob with a relative distance be dBw. There are\nmany different ways of setting this distance metric, such as\nEuclidean distance, hop distance etc., which will be specified\nfor the given example.\nIfvandware different neighbors, an entanglement swap\nis attempted. If vandwrefer to the same neighbor, then the\nsecond closest neighbor to Alice, v′, and the second closest\nneighbor to Bob, w′, are found. The quantities dAv′+dBw\nanddAv+dBw′are compared, and the pair that minimizes\nthis choice is chosen to perform a swap. If these quantities\nare the same, the quantities dBv′+dAwanddBv+dAw′are\ncompared, and the pair that maximizes this value is chosen\nto perform a swap. The reasoning behind this condition is\nexplained in Appendix B. If neither v′norw′exist, a self\nconnection will be made when possible such that two links\nbetween the node and the same neighbor from different\ntimesteps will attempt swapping. (This prevents the protocol\nfrom creating holes in the path between consumers and \nattempt swapping. (This prevents the protocol\nfrom creating holes in the path between consumers and is\ndone as a last resort.) In all of these cases, the procedure is\nrepeated until s≤1.\nPerformance Metric:\nthis paper aims to compare the average entanglement dis-\ntribution rate achieved by different routing protocols over\nvarious network conditions. After each entanglement gener-\nation attempt occurs, the network will have different links\npresent/absent. This instance of the network can be thought\nof as a particular network snapshot. The average number\nof Bell pairs shared between consumers given by a certain\nprotocol for a particular network snapshot is defined as:\nN(S) :=X\nl∈LY\ni∈lqi (1)\nwhereLis the set of link-disjoint paths connecting Alice and\nBob allowed by the particular snapshot Sand by the protocol\nbeing evaluated, l∈ L is a single path in L,i∈lis a node\nalong the path l(not including Alice and Bob), and qiis the\nprobability that a BSM will succeed at node i. The average\n3Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nFIGURE 2: The average rate of the dynamic protocol, in-\ndicated by solid lines, approaches the values predicted for\nR∞(p, q,∞). The corresponding bounds are shown above,\nindicated by dashed lines, for the case that Alice and Bob\nwere both along the diagonal with a hop distance of 10\nbetween them. Low values of qare more detrimental to the\nrate, as the dynamic routing protocol and time multiplexing\ncan compensate for low pvalues.\nrate of a protocol as a function of kgiven a certain network\nis defined as:\nR(k) :=1\nkX\nS∈SP(S, k)N(S) (2)\nwhere Sgives the set of all possible snapshots for a given\nnetwork, and P(S, k)gives the probability of the particular\nsnapshot Safter ktimesteps. In this paper, the average\nrate will be approximated by sampling from Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We will now introduce a notation to compare the\naverage rates under different circumstances. The average rate\nwill be written as Rk(\n to compare the\naverage rates under different circumstances. The average rate\nwill be written as Rk(p, q, µ )Bell pairs per time slot, where\nk, p, q, andµhave all been previously defined.\nIII. MEMORIES WITH INFINITE STORAGE LIFETIME\nIn this section, we apply the dynamic routing protocol de-\nscribed previously to two different network topologies with\nµ=∞. Initially, we apply it to a large square grid, for\nwhich the Euclidean distance metric was found to be the most\nfavorable metric. The simulated entanglement rates are used\nto better understand the general behavior of this protocol.\nThen we apply this protocol to a smaller six-node network.\nIn these cases, hop distance is the metric used to determine\nlocal swaps. The entanglement rates given by this simulation\nare then compared against those attained using global state\nknowledge.\nA. 2D SQUARE LATTICE\n1) Initial Performance Evaluation\nTwo consumers placed on a square grid can have at most four\nedge disjoint paths connecting them. When time multiplexing\nis introduced so that any edge can have up to klinks, the\nFIGURE 3: Comparison of the average rate achievable\nwith time multiplexing when using only one success\nper edge vs using multiple successes across timesteps.\nR1(peff,0.9,∞)/k, when p= 0.5, shows the average rate\nwhen limited to only using one success. R1(1,0.9,∞)/k\nprovides an upper bound to this and is included to to highlight\nthe inverse scaling with k. The average rate when you are al-\nlowed to use multiple successes is given by Rk(0.5,0.9,∞).\nR1(1,0.9,∞)/kis also included to to highlight the inverse\nscaling with k. Data was collected from a 2D square grid\nwhere Alice and Bob were 10 hops away apart and on the\ndiagonal.\nFIGURE 4: As kincreases, the average rate of the dynamic\nprotocol approaches the predicted bound, indicated by the\ndashed line. As k− → ∞ , a linear relationship emerges\nbetween the average rate and p. The data depicted here is for\nthe case where Alice and Bob were both along the diagonal\nwith \nand p. The data depicted here is for\nthe case where Alice and Bob were both along the diagonal\nwith a hop distance of 10 between them.\n4Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nFIGURE 5: Given that Alice and Bob are both along the\ndiagonal with a hop distance of 10 between them, the average\nrates for k= 1andk= 100 are compared over different val-\nues of pandq. Assuming there is no decoherence, increasing\nthe time multiplexing block length can only help the average\nrate.\n.\nmaximum number of connections between consumers is 4k.\nIfkis sufficiently large, the average number of links along\na given edge will be pk. Letting q= 1 , we expect 4pk\nconnections between consumers. Dividing this by kyields\nan average rate of 4pBell pairs per time slot. For general q,\nin the limit as kgets large, the highest that the average rate\ncan get is given by\nR∞(p, q,∞) =pR1(1, q,∞)\n=pθX\ni=1qmi−1(3)\nwhere miis the hop distance of the ith shortest path on the\nunderlying graph, which is found via the greedy algorithm.\nAs depicted in Fig. 2, the dynamic protocol is able to\napproach this bound on the square grid. We note that low\nvalues of qare more detrimental to the rate than low values\nofp. This is because time multiplexing can compensate for\nlowpvalues. The probability that an edge has at least one\nsuccessful link after ktimesteps is\npeff= 1−(1−p)k, (4)\nwhich monotonically increases with k. If we were to use only\none success along any edge, the rate would then be equiva-\nlent to R1(peff, q,∞)/k, which scales as k−1. However, the\ndynamic protocol utilizes as much entanglement as possible,\nultimately overcoming this scaling as shown in Fig. 3. When\nkis small, there are cases where the opposite is true. In Fig.\n3, when k∈[2,6], using multiple successes results in a\nlower average rate because there is an increased likelihood\nof paths to self loop. The value of pdetermines how quickly\nthe average rate approaches R∞(p, q,∞), as shown in Fig.\n4.\nWhen\nhe value of pdetermines how quickly\nthe average rate approaches R∞(p, q,∞), as shown in Fig.\n4.\nWhen p= 1, time multiplexing doesn’t show an improve-\nment to rate since there is no improvement to peff, as shownin Fig. 5. It is important to note that while the average rate\nonly benefits from larger k, the corresponding latency suffers.\nTherefore realistically, one should choose some finite kbased\non the desired latency.\n2) Varying consumer orientations\nWe now compare the dynamic protocol against the static pro-\ntocol and determine the ideal protocol based on the network\nparameter regime. Generally, for the 2D square grid graph\nthe distance based routing protocol does best when a Eu-\nclidean distance metric is used to make swapping decisions,\nas opposed to a Hop distance metric. However, even with this\nmetric, the dynamic protocol is only able to outperform the\nstatic protocol in certain situations.\nWhen k= 1 and the consumers are oriented along the\ndiagonal, the dynamic protocol outperforms the static pro-\ntocol for p \u003C 1. For this specific orientation, the dynamic\nprotocol naturally maps over the same paths as those chosen\nby the static paths algorithm, unless those links do not exist.\nHowever, unlike the static protocol, the dynamic protocol\nis able to adapt when there are failed links. When p= 1,\nthe static and dynamic protocols perform equally well. This\nbehavior is consistent regardless of the distance between\nconsumers.\nAskincreases however, a region emerges in p, qspace,\nshown in Fig. 6, where the static protocol outperforms the\ndynamic protocol. This behavior stems from the additional\nordering that the static path protocol introduces, so that it\nis able to more efficiently use successful entangled links\nthan the dynamic protocol. The static path protocol does\nbetter when pis large, but the exact size and shape of this\nregion depends on kand the distance between consumers.\nAs the distance between consumers grows, the static protocol\nperforms better for lower p\n consumers.\nAs the distance between consumers grows, the static protocol\nperforms better for lower pvalues.\nWhen k= 1and the consumers are not oriented along the\ndiagonal, there already exists a region in p, qspace where p\nis large where the static protocol outperforms the dynamic\nprotocol. This is because when consumers aren’t along the\ndiagonal, the dynamic protocol doesn’t always choose the\nmost efficient paths. Thus there exists a value pthat is large\nenough that the ability to reroute paths is less useful than the\ndirectness of the paths provided by the static path protocol.\nWhen q= 1 the length of a path no longer matters, as all\nBSMs are deterministic. However, there still exists a range\nof values of pwhere the static protocol does better, showing\nthat the dynamic protocol not only chooses longer paths, but\nalso makes decisions that do not result in continuous paths\nbetween consumers. As kincreases, the quantity peffdefined\nin Eqn. (4) increases, explaining why the borders shift to\nlower pvalues.\nWith the condition explained in Appendix B, the dynamic\nprotocol does better for a larger range of values assuming\nthe consumers are along the same column when compared\nto other off diagonal orientations. When k \u003E 1and the\nManhattan distance is fixed, the border separating the regions\nwhere the dynamic protocol does better from where the static\n5Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nFIGURE 6: The regions where the dynamic/static protocol\nperforms better for consumers along the column and diagonal\nwith different hop distances apart are demarcated. To the left\nof the lines the dynamic protocol does better and to the right\nof the lines the static protocol does better. As kincreases,\nthe range of pandqvalues where the dynamic protocol\noutperforms the static diminishes. If a line is not shown on\nthe plot, the dynamic protocol does better for all p, q values.\nprotocol does better occurs at lower pvalues for the column\norie\nol does better for all p, q values.\nprotocol does better occurs at lower pvalues for the column\norientation and higher pvalues for diagonal orientation. The\nborder for other angles falls between these two cases.\nWhen k \u003E 1and the angle is fixed, the border shifts to\nlower pvalues as the Manhattan distance is increased. The\nlarger distance between consumers requires more successful\nBSMs. The ability to reroute is not as important, so static\npaths do better since they are chosen to minimize the number\nof these BSMs. As qgoes to one however, the difference in\npath lengths does not matter as much, explaining why the\nborders appear to tilt diagonally upwards.\nThe network topology and the relative locations of the\nconsumers determine the effectiveness of the dynamic proto-\ncol.This section shows that the effectiveness of the dynamic\ndistance based routing algorithm is impacted by the network\ntopology as well as the consumer locations. The dynamic\nprotocol is the better option when networks have low con-\nnectivity, as it can adaptively choose different repeaters to\nroute over. However, static or fixed path routing is usually\npreferable when connectivity is high.\nB. SMALL NETWORK EXAMPLES\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the protocols\non the six node network depicted in Fig. 7. This network\nis representative of near-term quantum networks, which will\nhave a small number of nodes that span across a building, a\ncampus, or an urban center. The size of the network was also\nchosen so that the average rate of the dynamic local link state\nknowledge protocol could be compared against two global\nlink state knowledge routing protocols introduced in [17] and\nFIGURE 7: The architecture of our six node graph. The\nlines depict channels over which links can be generated. The\ndashed lines are to distinguish the channels between (Alice,3)\nand (2,3) which may be removed to compare the impact of\ntopology.\nFIGURE 8: The average rates found using a global knowl-\nedge (dashed lines\ne the impact of\ntopology.\nFIGURE 8: The average rates found using a global knowl-\nedge (dashed lines) and local link state knowledge (solid\nlines) are depicted for three variations of the six-node net-\nwork shown in Fig. 7. Base Graph refers to this network\nwith all channels present. Removal of certain channels of\nthis base graph is shown to always hurt the average rate of\nthe global algorithm, but can improve the average rate of the\nlocal algorithm.\n[?].\nFor the dynamic local link state knowledge protocol,\nshown in Fig. 8 by the solid lines, the distance metric uti-\nlized to inform decisions was based on hop distance. Two\ndifferent calculations were done to obtain the global link\nstate knowledge rates. Firstly, the mixed-integer quadrati-\ncally constrained program (MIQCP) code from [ ?] was used\nto calculate the maximum rate for every potential snapshot,\nor unique instance, of the network. The average rate of the\nnetwork, provided global link state knowledge and optimal\ndecision making, was then calculated by summing over the\nsnapshot rates weighed by their likelihood of occurring. This\n6Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nwas then compared against a suboptimal scheme presented\nin [17]. The main difference was the latter protocol used\nglobal link state knowledge and repeatably applied Dijkstra’s\nalgorithm to find the rate of each snapshot. The rates found by\nthis greedy algorithm, which may not be optimal, were simi-\nlarly weighed by their likelihood, providing the average rate\nwith global link state knowledge and sub-optimal decision-\nmaking. The benefit of such a protocol is that the calculation\ncan be performed far more quickly. These results were in\nagreement up to seven significant digits, and are represented\nby the dashed lines in Fig. 8.\nThree versions of the six node graph shown in Fig. 7 were\nevaluated. The first included all the channels present in the\nfigure. The second included all, but the channel be\ne first included all the channels present in the\nfigure. The second included all, but the channel between\nrepeater 2 and repeater 3. The third included all the channels,\nbut the channel between Alice and repeater 3. The average\nrates given by the global algorithms did best when more\nchannels were present, since there were simply more poten-\ntial paths that could be chosen to route over. However, the\nlocal protocol did best when the channel between repeaters 2\nand 3 was removed. Similar to Braess’ paradox in classical\nrouting, where adding more roads to a road network can\nslow down the overall traffic, our local algorithm can perform\nworse on networks when there are more channels if these\nchannels create a contention for paths. Consider a snapshot\nwhere all links succeed except for the one between Alice and\nrepeater 3. Since the repeater nodes are making decisions on\ntheir own, the local protocol can result in the path given by\nAlice, 2, 3, Bob, which intersects the two otherwise disjoint\npaths. The dynamic protocol performs best on topologies\nwhere there are multiple subsections of the graph connected\nin parallel at the consumer nodes. Otherwise, fixed path\nrouting or some form of network-divisions similar to those\nintroduced in [22] should be used to work around this.\nIV. MEMORIES WITH LIMITED STORAGE LIFETIME\nThe previously discussed results imply that as long as con-\nsumers are willing to wait for some increased latency cost,\ntime multiplexing always helps improve the rate of entan-\nglement distribution. However, as time multiplexing blocks\nincrease in length, qubits stored in the quantum memories\nexperience more decoherence. We now relax the assumption\nthat qubits are held in the quantum memories indefinitely\nand instead will evaluate for a finite valued µ. This model\nwill be applied to a 2D grid network to show that for given\nnetwork conditions, there arises a finite kfor which the rate\nof entanglement is maximized.\nFor such a network, there exists a trade-off \nnite kfor which the rate\nof entanglement is maximized.\nFor such a network, there exists a trade-off between the\nbenefits of increased time multiplexing block length and the\nrisk of losing already established entangled links, as shown\nin Fig. 9. This relationship results in an optimal time mul-\ntiplexing value, kopt, dependent on the network conditions.\nFig. 10 shows that as pdecreases, koptincreases. When p\ngoes to one, so that external links are deterministic, time\nmultiplexing is no longer useful, and kopt= 1. Fig. 11 shows\nthat even with decoherence, there is an improvement in rate\nFIGURE 9: The average rates for a variety of (p, q)values\nare shown here in the presence and absence of decoherence.\nThe solid line is for µ= 100 , the dotted line is for µ=∞\nand the dashed line shows the upper limit R∞(p, q,∞). In\nthe case of p= 1, the dotted and dashed lines overlap.\nFIGURE 10: In the presence of decoherence, each value of p\nhas an optimal value k, denoted as kopt, such that the average\nrate is largest for that time multiplexing block length. As p\ndecreases, koptincreases.\nwith time multiplexing, as seen by the envelope. The amount\nof improvement is limited by the magnitude of µ. Asµgoes\nto infinity, the achievable rates with time multiplexing will\nincrease, eventually resembling Fig. 4. Fig. 12 also agrees\nwith previous results, as it shows that as µincreases, so\ndoeskopt. In the case where quantum memories have infinite\nlifetime, and thus no decoherence, the rate continues to\nincrease with k. Fig. 14 shows the improved rate over (p, q)\nspace, using the values of koptshown in Fig. 13. There is\nnoise in the data stemming from the finite number of trials\nthe Monte Carlo simulation was run over and the limited data\npoints collected, so it is not immediately clear if the value of q\nimpacts the optimal k, despite it clearly affecting the average\nrate. However, it is once again clear that time multiplexing\nhelps, especially in the case of lower p.\n7Van Milligen et al. : E\ngain clear that time multiplexing\nhelps, especially in the case of lower p.\n7Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nFIGURE 11: In the presence of decoherence, time multi-\nplexing can help bridge the gap between R1(p, q,100) and\nR∞(p, q,∞). However, this improvement is bounded by an\nenvelope determined by the value of µ.\nFIGURE 12: There is a monotonically increasing relation-\nship between koptandµ, which in the limit of µ− → ∞ agrees\nwith the results without decoherence. Note, k= 10 was the\nmaximum value tried for k.\nFIGURE 13: The value of kopt∈[1,10]is indicated here for\na range of values of pandq. No optimal k was found in the\nwhite region, as the rate remained zero over all trials.\nFIGURE 14: The solid lines here indicate the contour lines\nofRkopt(p, q,10)whereas the dashed lines demarcate the\ncontour lines of R1(p, q,10). Note the dashes lines do not\nspan the entire space, because due to the finite number of\ntrials run, they returned rates of zero below p= 0.4.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis study discusses a local link state knowledge multi-path\nrouting protocol that utilizes time multiplexed repeaters. In\nthe case of no decoherence, the average entanglement rate\nincreases monotonically with the time multiplexing block\nlength k. This is because the probability of have a link\nbetween repeaters increases with k. Theoretically, to maxi-\nmize the rate of entanglement distribution, it is best to let\nk− → ∞ . This is not practical, however, as latency and the\nrequired number of quantum memories also become infinite.\nTherefore, the value of kmust be chosen while keeping both\nthe initial latency and memory buffer length in mind. Future\nwork should consider the effects of having a fixed number of\nquantum memories in the repeaters on optimal scheduling.\nThe distance metric chosen and the topology of the net-\nwork itself, impacts how effectively the dynamic protocol\nperforms with respect to a static fixed path routing algorithm.\nFor \nffectively the dynamic protocol\nperforms with respect to a static fixed path routing algorithm.\nFor the case of a 2D grid, the dynamic protocol performs\nbest when consumers reside on the diagonal. In general,\nthe performance of the dynamic protocol when compared\nto the static protocol depends on the values of p, q, k and\nthe locations of the consumers. The dynamic protocol was\nalso applied to a smaller six node network, so that it could\nbe compared to the global optimum rate. The local link\nstate knowledge protocol can perform comparably well when\nconsumers are connected via disjoint subsets of repeaters.\nHowever, when there is a high contention for the same paths,\nour local protocol cannot approach the average rates seen\nwith global link state knowledge. Future works could eval-\nuate a wider variety of topologies to further explore how the\nstructure of the quantum network impacts the performance of\nthe protocol.\nA step function decoherence model was also used in the\nsimulation to see how the mean lifetime of qubits held in the\nquantum memories impacted the effects of time multiplexing.\nIn this case, an optimal kvalue emerges which balances\nthe benefits from time multiplexing with the increased risk\nof losing a Bell pair. It was seen that as pdecreases or µ\n8Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nincreases, the value of koptincreases. To fully understand\nthe effect of qonkopt, further study is needed; however, we\nconjecture that there may be a connection stemming from the\nfact increasing kallows for more direct paths to be routed\nover. Overall, the results with decoherence agree with the\nresults without decoherence when µ− → ∞ .\nThe decoherence model used in this paper can be improved\nupon by introducing non-unit fidelity links. These links could\nthen undergo depolarization noise channels to model both\nthe effects of being held in the quantum memory over time,\nas well as the noise introduced by the imperfect gates us\neing held in the quantum memory over time,\nas well as the noise introduced by the imperfect gates used\nto perform BSMs. With this, time multiplexing could then\nbe combined with distillation techniques, which would result\nin purer states, but at the cost of reducing to the number of\nBell pairs delivered to the consumers over some fixed time.\nA protocol dictating how and when to distill links would then\nneed to be considered.\n.\nAPPENDIX A DISTANCE BASED ROUTING\nPSEUDOCODE\nIn this appendix we provide the pseudocode for the External\nand Internal Phases of the Distance Based Routing Protocol.\nAlgorithm 1 External Phase\n1:foreach edge ein physical network do\n2: n1=source( e)\n3: n2=target( e)\n4: foreach timestep tfrom 1 to kdo\n5: ifUnifRand (0,1)\u003C pthen ▷Link success\n6: ifExpRand(1/ µ)≥k−tthen▷Decoherence\n7: AddLink( n1, n2)Algorithm 2 Internal Phase - Distance Based Routing\n1:foreach node nin physical network do\n2: ExtLinks = GetLinks( n)▷Lists external links at n\n3: s=len(ExtLinks) ▷Number of external links at n\n4: while s \u003E1do\n5: v←closest neighbor to Alice\n6: w←closest neighbor to Bob\n7: ifv̸=wthen\n8: mv=Qubit (n, v)▷memory at nlinked to v\n9: mw=Qubit (n, w)\n10: else if∃links between nand neighbor ̸=vthen\n11: v′←second closest neighbor to Alice\n12: w′←second closest neighbor to Bob\n13: ifdAv′+dBw\u003C dAv+dBw′then\n14: mv=Qubit (n, v′)\n15: mw=Qubit (n, w)\n16: else if dAv′+dBw\u003E dAv+dBw′then\n17: mv=Qubit (n, v)\n18: mw=Qubit (n, w′)\n19: else if dBv′+dAw\u003E dBv+dAw′then\n20: mv=Qubit (n, v′)\n21: mw=Qubit (n, w)\n22: else\n23: mv=Qubit (n, v)\n24: mw=Qubit (n, w′)\n25: else ▷Form a self connection\n26: mv=Qubit (n, v)\n27: mw=Qubit (n, w)\n28: ifUnifRand (0,1)\u003C qthen ▷BSM success\n29: BSM( mv, mw)\n30: ExtLinks.remove(Link( mv))\n31: ExtLinks.remove(Link( mw))\n32: s=s−2\nAPPENDIX B “STRAIGHT PATH\" PROTOCOL\nRecall the Distance Based Routing Protocol definition given\nin Section II.\nAt every node the successfully connected neighbor closest\nto Alice/Bob was denoted v/w, and their relative distanc\nthe successfully connected neighbor closest\nto Alice/Bob was denoted v/w, and their relative distances\nwere defined dAv/dBw.

The quantities dBv′+dAwanddBv+dAw′\nwould be compared, and the pair that maximizes this value\nwould be chosen to perform a swap.\nPrior to this addition, the average rate of the distance based\nrouting protocol was considerably lower when consumers\nwere off diagonal for the 2D grid graph. An example of a\nsnapshot generated prior to the introduction of the straight\npath protocol is shown in Fig. 15, which is clearly not routing\nalong the most direct paths, despite attaining the maximum\n9Van Milligen et al. : Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters\nFIGURE 15: A possible snapshot for p= 1, q= 1, k= 1\non a small 2D grid graph when the straight path preference is\nnot included.\nrate of 4. However, repeater nodes 2, 13, 15, 19, 21, and 32 all\ncould make different decisions, such that the rate of a given\nsnapshot, even when p= 1, q= 1, is as low as 1. After the\ninclusion of this “straight path\" protocol, all snapshots gave\na rate of three or four when p= 1, q= 1.

This can then be used to compare against our simulated\nRk(1, q, µ)values.\nIn the presence of imperfect \ns can then be used to compare against our simulated\nRk(1, q, µ)values.\nIn the presence of imperfect memories, let the random\nvariable describing the lifetime of an individual link be\nlabelled L. This value is sampled from\npL[l] =1\nµe−l\nµ, (5)\nwhere l∈R≥0. The actual quantity of interest is the\nprobability that the lifetime of a link is greater than some\nvalue l, which is given by:\npL[L≥l] =e−l\nµ. (6)\nA link generated in the ith time slot, where i∈[1, k],\nmust survive until the kth time slot in order to be used to\nconnect two consumers. Therefore the likelihood of it having\na lifetime at least t=k−itimesteps long is given by:\ns(t) =pL[L≥t] =e−t\nµ\nwhich is denoted s(t)for brevity.Note for the most recently generated link, i.e. when i=k\nandt= 0 ,s(t= 0) = 1 . Since every edge will have\nsuch a link in the case p= 1, there will always be at least\none path along the chain of repeaters over which d−1\nBSMs will be performed to connect consumers. This case\nwill then contribute the termqd−1\nkto the final rate calculation.\nFrom here forward then the focus will be on links where\ni, t∈[1, k−1].\nThe probability that any edge has ncorrectable links\ngenerated in time slots i∈[1, k−1]at the end of the k\ntimesteps is:\npN[n] =k−1X\nx1,..xn∈[1,k−1]\nx1̸=···̸=xnY\ni∈[x1,..xn]Y\nj /∈[x1,..xn]s(i)(1−s(j))\nThe probability of having mpaths then comes from M=\nmin(N1, N2,···, Nd)where Niare iid from pN[n]. The\nprobability of having mpaths is then given by:\npM[m] =d−1X\nx=0d!\nd!(d−x)!pN[m]d−xk−1X\ni1,...ix=m+1Y\nj∈[i1,...ix]pN[j]\n(7)\nThe average rate attainable by a linear chain of time\nmultiplexed repeaters of length dblock length kwhen p= 1\nis then given by:\nRk(1, q, µ) =qd−1\nk\u0000\n1 +k−1X\nm=1mpM(m)\u0001\n(8)\nwithpM(m)defined above.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nEV , EJ, AP, DT and SG acknowledge support from the NSF\ngrant CNS-1955834, and NSF-ERC Center for Quantum\nNetworks grant EEC-1941583.

Overcoming this sensitivity is central\nto designing quantum networks capable of transmitting quantum\ninformation reliably over large distances. Moreover, the ability to\ncharacterize communication noise in quantum networks is crucial\nin developing network protocols capable of overcoming the effects\nof noise in quantum networks. In this context, quantum network\ntomography refers to the characterization of channel noise in\na quantum network through end-to-end measurements. In this\nwork, we propose network tomography protocols for quantum\nstar networks formed by quantum channels characterized by a\nsingle, non-trivial Pauli operator. Our results further the end-\nto-end characterization of quantum bit-flip star networks by\nintroducing tomography protocols where state distribution and\nmeasurements are designed separately. We build upon previously\nproposed quantum network tomography protocols, as well as\nprovide novel methods for the unique characterization of bit-\nflip probabilities in stars. We introduce a theoretical benchmark\nbased on the Quantum Fisher Information matrix to compare\nthe efficiency of quantum network protocols. We apply our\ntechniques to the protocols proposed, and provide an initial\nanalysis on the potential benefits of entanglement for Quantum\nNetwork Tomography. Furthermore, we simulate the proposed\nprotocols using NetSquid to assess the convergence properties\nof the estimators obtained for particular parameter regimes.\nOur findings show that the efficiency of protocols depend on\nparameter v\nrticular parameter regimes.\nOur findings show that the efficiency of protocols depend on\nparameter values and motivate the search for adaptive quantum\nnetwork tomography protocols.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networks are a critical component of the next\nquantum revolution. The interconnection of quantum process-\ning systems with channels that provide quantum communi-\ncation are key for the scalability of quantum computers [1],\nand enable applications such as quantum key distribution [2],\n[3], quantum secrete sharing [4] and distributed quantum\nsensing [5]–[7]. Despite recent experimental demonstrations of\nentanglement distribution in quantum networks with fiber [8],\n[9] and free-space communications [10], [11], the fragility\nof quantum information in the face of noise remains as the\nmajor barrier to the physical realization of scalable, useful\nquantum networks. This barrier is inherent to the complex-\nity of quantum communication systems, which must inte-\ngrate diverse quantum and classical hardware. In particular,\nhardware imperfections introduce unavoidable noise in the\nquantum information exchanged among network nodes during\ncommunication. A quantum network node must be capable\nof initializing, storing, and processing quantum information,either using memory in the form of matter qubits [12]–[14]\nor by storing photons in delay lines [15]. The inefficiencies in\nmemory devices introduce noise in the form of decoherence\nand loss [16], as well as through gate imperfections which\ncan introduce diverse processing noise. Moreover, photons are\nthe fundamental transmission media for quantum information\nand performing transduction is key in networks with matter-\nbased memories that are not optically active [17], [18]. In\naddition to transduction, frequency conversion is necessary\nsince different light frequencies are optimal for different appli-\ncations [18]. For instance, optimal frequencies for processing\ncan differ from the usual telecom band that reduces photon\nloss in fi\nmal frequencies for processing\ncan differ from the usual telecom band that reduces photon\nloss in fibers [19]. Due to unavoidable imperfections in im-\nplementation, transduction and frequency conversion methods\nare themselves sources of noise. Finally, the propagation of\nphotons in fiber and free space incurs losses and phase errors,\nwhich can corrupt the information encoded in photons [20],\n[21].\nThe noise introduced in the different layers of communi-\ncation hardware accumulates as multiple nodes are used for\ncommunication. Whether it be in one-way network architec-\ntures, where quantum information is directly transmitted across\nquantum channels interconnecting the nodes, or in two-way\narchitectures, where the channels are used to generate and\npropagate entangled states for teleportation, the greater the\nnumber of nodes required to establish communication, the\nhigher the noise introduced in the information transmitted.\nTherefore, the development of quantum error correction codes\nand decoders [22], as well as purification protocols [23], [24]\ncapable of improving upon the negative effects of noise in\nquantum communication is instrumental to further the physical\nimplementation of useful quantum networks. Furthermore, the\ndesign of noise-aware applications is fundamental in Noisy\nIntermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, since it is not\npossible to rely on complex quantum error correction protocols\nto achieve fault-tolerant quantum operations. In particular,\nquantum circuit compilation routines can be optimized based\non gate and memory noise models to obtain a gain in perfor-\nmance [25].\nThe demand for quantum error correction and purification\nprotocols, as well as the design of noise-aware applications\nrenders network noise characterization as a central topic in\nthe development of quantum networks. Error decoding in\nquantum error correction protocols benefits vastly from the\ncharacterization of errors processes. In addition, noise-awarearXiv:2307.05854v1  [quant-p\n from the\ncharacterization of errors processes. In addition, noise-awarearXiv:2307.05854v1  [quant-ph]  12 Jul 20232\napplications need to use either static or dynamic error models\nto optimize behavior and increase efficiency [25]. In this\ncontext, Quantum Network Tomography (QNT) has been pre-\nviously introduced to address the end-to-end characterization\nof network links [26]. It connects classical network tomog-\nraphy [27] with quantum parameter estimation [28] to devise\nefficient characterization methods for link noise in quantum\ncommunication through end-to-end measurements. End-to-end\ncharacterization is based on the assumption that quantum\nnetwork infrastructure cannot be directly accessed to estimate\nlink parameters. Thus, network users must obtain channel\nestimates by measuring quantum states that were distributed\nthrough the network. End-to-end estimation is considerably\nharder than point-to-point link estimation, i.e., independent\nestimation of network links, due to the fact that quantum\nchannels cannot be probed directly. Instead, they act as hidden,\nunobservable processes for which statistics must be obtained\nby observing the systemic behavior of the network.\nQNT differs from Quantum Process Tomography (QPT)\nin a meaningful way. QNT considers an end-to-end network\nestimation problem, where the parameters to be estimated\ncannot be directly measured, while QPT aims to estimate\nblack-box processes. For simplicity, the QNT formulation\nfocused on in this article, assumes that network links represent\nquantum channels, i.e Completely Positive Trace Preserving\n(CPTP) maps, with a known parametric form. It is considered\nthat each operator in the Kraus decomposition of a channel\nis of a given parametric form, and the goal is to estimate the\nparameters to characterize all the links. Such assumption is\nabsent in the general QPT formulation which has the goal of\nestimating each component of transfer matrices characterizing\nCPTP maps. QPT can be used to characterize ne\ning each component of transfer matrices characterizing\nCPTP maps. QPT can be used to characterize networks by\nintroducing additional assumptions in its general formulation,\nalthough we do not address methods of this form in this article.\nA. Contributions\nProviding efficient solutions for the characterization of arbi-\ntrary quantum networks is extremely challenging. Nonetheless,\nthe initial work in QNT [26] studied the particular case of\nquantum star networks with links representing probabilistic\none-qubit Pauli channels, described by a single Pauli operator\nand one parameter, e.g quantum bit-flip star networks with\ndifferent flip probabilities in general. Two methods have been\npreviously proposed to obtain estimators for all of the network\nparameters: a method that uniquely identifies the parameter\nvector characterizing the network with the aid of global\nmeasurements, and a method that relies on local measurements\nto produce two estimates for the parameter vector. In this work,\nwe provide additional results for the characterization of star\nnetworks and improve on the analysis of the methods proposed\nin [26]. Our contributions are four-folded:\n•We provide a new general description of QNT protocols\nin which state distribution and measurements are sepa-\nrately defined. This definition enables methods where the\nsame state distribution protocol is used to generate differ-\nent estimators based on distinct measurements performed\nat the end-nodes. In addition, it enables the constructionof tomography protocols that combine multiple, distinct\nstate distribution circuits and measurements to uniquely\nidentify network parameters.\n•We provide novel QNT protocols for the unique charac-\nterization of bit-flip stars. The protocols use both global\nand local quantum measurements at the network nodes\nto estimate parameters. Moreover, the QNT protocols\nproposed generalize to stars with either ZorYflip\nchannels through a change of basis in the operators used\nat the network nodes.\n•We an\nither ZorYflip\nchannels through a change of basis in the operators used\nat the network nodes.\n•We analyze the QNT protocols proposed in this article,\nand compare their estimation efficiencies. Our analysis\nis centered on the numerical evaluation of the Quantum\nFisher Information Matrix (QFIM) containing link pa-\nrameters. Our findings show that estimation efficiency\nof the protocols proposed depend on the values of the\nparameters to be estimated. This dependency in parameter\nvalue is similar to the findings reported in [29] for the\nestimation of single-qubit depolarizing channels.\n•We simulate the designed QNT protocols in four-node\nstar networks using the discrete-event quantum network\nsimulator NetSquid [30]. We use simulations to numer-\nically analyze the convergence rate of the estimators in\nwhich our QNT protocols are based on. Our findings from\nsimulation are in accordance with the results obtained for\nthe QFIM, and show how the different QNT protocols\nbehave in a particular parameter regime.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows: in\nSection II, we provide the necessary background knowledge\nto discuss our contributions; we describe the state distribution\nand measurement protocols used to devise QNT protocols\nin Section III; in Section IV, we present the tomography\nprotocols for the unique characterization of network links; our\nsimulation results and numerical analysis are reported in Sec-\ntion V; finally, we present concluding remarks in Section VI.\nII. B ACKGROUND\nQuantum networks are represented as graphs, with nodes\nrepresenting arbitrary quantum processors and links repre-\nsenting quantum channels that enable the nodes to exchange\nquantum information. This work focuses on quantum star\nnetworks with links characterized by one-qubit probabilistic\nquantum channels Eeof the form\nEe(ρ) =θeρ+ (1−θe)σρσ, (1)\nwhere θe∈[0,1],ρ:H2→H2is the two-qubit density\noperator, and σ=X. The assumption of bit-flip channels is\nconsidered for simplicity, and all t\nnsity\noperator, and σ=X. The assumption of bit-flip channels is\nconsidered for simplicity, and all the tomography protocols\ndescribed in this work generalize to the case where σ=Yor\nσ=Zunder a basis transformation of all the operations per-\nformed and states used. A quantum (n+1)-node star network\nis formed by the interconnection of nend-nodes through an\nintermediate node, as depicted in Fig.1. We represent the nodes\nof the star as vjforj∈ {0, . . . , n }, and label the intermediate\nnode as vn. The link (vj, vn)represents a quantum channel\nEjfollowing (1).3\nFig. 1: Quantum star networks.\nA. System model\nThe nodes of the network are assumed capable of initializing\nqubits in the computational basis state |0⟩and of performing\narbitrary quantum circuits to process them. The end-nodes\ncommunicate quantum information by preparing qubits in\narbitrary states and transmitting them through the intermediate\nnode, one qubit at a time. The channels act on the qubits\ntransmitted through the intermediate node and corrupt the\nstates with bit-flip noise. Furthermore, we assume that noise\nintroduced in link (vj, vn)by channel Ejis symmetric, such\nthat the probability of a bit-flip occurring in a transmission\nfrom node vjtovnis the same as that of a flip occurring in the\nopposite direction. Therefore, a star network is characterized\nbynbit-flip probabilities that specify (1) for all channels.\nWe consider QNT protocols for the star network using\nan intermediate node for quantum state distribution. Such a\nprotocol consists of a set C={C1, C2, . . . , C S}of state\ndistribution circuits, ϖ={Π1, . . . , ΠS}ofPositive Operator-\nValued Measures (POVM), and M={m1, . . . , m S}of num-\nber of measurement copies to be performed. In particular, the\nstate distribution circuit Ciis performed mitimes to generate\nmicopies of a distributed state ρi(θ)in the end-nodes, each of\nwhich is measured with POVMs Πi. We consider all POVMs\nto be projective measurements in multiple qubits. Therefore,\ntheM=P\nimim\ns Πi. We consider all POVMs\nto be projective measurements in multiple qubits. Therefore,\ntheM=P\nimimeasurement outcomes form a data set Dof\nMbinary strings that can be used to perform estimation. It\nis important to emphasize that the intermediate node cannot\nperform quantum measurements to contribute to Ddirectly,\notherwise the problem reduces to the case where each channel\nis independently estimated. Note that circuits in Crepresent\ndistributed circuits, and channels are used to transmit qubits\nwhen necessary.\nWhen discussing state distribution protocols in the star, we\nrefer to the end-node that starts the process as the root of the\nprotocol and to the remaining end-nodes as leaves . Moreover,\nwe refer to quantum state distribution circuits as quantum state\ndistribution algorithms interchangeably in the remainder of this\nwork.\nB. States in the GHZ basis\nSome of the tomography protocols proposed in this article\nare based on the distribution of mixed states diagonal in the\nGreenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) basis. The n-qubit GHZ\nbasis generalizes the Bell basis to nqubits, and has 2nstates\nthat, when written in the computational basis, assume the form\n|Φs⟩=|0s1:⟩+ (−1)s0|1s1:⟩√\n2(2)where s∈ {0,1}nis an n-bit string, sis the bit-wise negation\nofs,s0is the first bit of sands1:∈ {0,1}n−1is the string\nobtained by removing s0froms. For example, when s= 0101 ,\ns0= 0,s1:= 101 ands= 1010 . We denote the projector\nonto|ϕs⟩asΦs=|ϕs⟩⟨ϕs|. Specifying the GHZ basis in the\nZbasis is helpful when Zbasis measurement statistics are to\nbe extracted from such states. Similarly, expressing the GHZ\nbasis in the Xbasis of nqubits will prove helpful in the\ndescription of tomography protocols. As a matter of fact, a\ncomplete description of the states in the general case is not\nnecessary and we consider the rule that specifies what states of\ntheXbasis have non-zero components when |ϕs⟩is projected\nin that basis. Thus, let |x+⟩denote a state in the Xbasis of\nn-qubits, such that\nx+\nj=(\n+,ifxj\nected\nin that basis. Thus, let |x+⟩denote a state in the Xbasis of\nn-qubits, such that\nx+\nj=(\n+,ifxj= 0,\n−,ifxj= 1,(3)\ne.g|0+1+0+⟩=|+−+⟩. Using the bit string representation,\nthe inner product ⟨x+|ϕs⟩provides the component of |ϕs⟩in\ntheXbasis as\n\nx+\f\fϕs\u000B\n=⟨x+|0s1:⟩+ (−1)s0⟨x+|1s1:⟩√\n2. (4)\nThrough algebraic manipulations, it is possible to show that\n\nx+\f\fϕs\u000B\n=(−1)x·0s1:+ (−1)s0+x·1s1:\n√\n2n+1, (5)\nwhere ·denotes the inner product between two binary strings.\nThe inner product allows to compute the probability of mea-\nsuring state |ϕs⟩in the Xbasis and obtaining state |x+⟩as\n\f\f\nx+\f\fϕs\u000B\f\f2=(s0+˜1·x) mod 2\n2n−1, (6)\nwhere ˜1 = 1 . . .1denotes an n-bit string with all bits equal\none. This last result implies that the probability will be non-\nzero only when the parity of xiss0, i.e if the number of\n−labels is even when s0= 0 and odd when s1= 1. The\nbinary parity of a string swill appear in the definition of\ndifferent estimators for the tomography problem. Therefore,\nletβ:{0,1}n→ {0,1}denote the function\nβ(s) = (n−1X\ni=0si) mod 2 . (7)\nC. Quantum Parameter Estimation\nThe quantum parameter estimation problem captures the\nestimation of a parameter vector θ∈Rnfrom a θ-dependent\nmixed state with density matrix ρ(θ). The goal is to describe\nan estimator ˆθ∈Rnforθbased on measurement statistics\nobtained from ρ(θ). A set of POVMs {Πj}is applied to\nρto generate a data set Dof observations that allow one\nto obtain statistics to estimate θ. In this work, we focus on\nquantum parameter estimation problems with Q-qubit mixed\nstates having density matrices of the form\nρ(θ) =2Q−1X\nk=0λk(θ)Λk, (8)4\nwhere λk:Rn→[0,1]andΛk:H2Q→H2Qdenote the k-th\neigenvalue of ρ(θ)and the projector onto its correspondent\neigenvector, respectively. Thus, the only dependence of ρin\nθcomes from its eigenvalues, i.e., ρdepends on θand its\neigenvectors do not. Such states are the focus in this work\nsince they arise from the action of quantum channels of the\nform in (1). Note that Qis arbitrary in this case, althou\nfrom the action of quantum channels of the\nform in (1). Note that Qis arbitrary in this case, although our\nmethods are based on states with Q=n−1andQ=n.\nThe Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) is a fun-\ndamental tool in the analysis of quantum estimation prob-\nlems [28], [31], [32]. For a given state ρ(θ), the entries of\nthe QFIM have the form\nFρ\nij=1\n2Tr[ρ{Li, Lj}],where (9)\n∂ρ(θ)\n∂θj=1\n2{ρ(θ), Lj}for all j, (10)\nand{A, B}=AB+BA denotes the anti-commutator of\noperators AandB. The matrix Ljis known as the Symmetric\nLogarithm Derivative (SLD) operator of parameter θjand its\ndiagonal basis is the optimal basis to measure ρin order to\nextract statistics to estimate θj. The element Fρ\njjis known\nas the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of ρwith respect\ntoθj, which gives how much information a measurement\nfrom ρcontains about θj. Since the SLDs specify the optimal\nmeasurements basis for each individual parameter, an optimal\nmeasurement for all parameters exists if and only if all SLDs\ncommute with each other. Moreover, the invertibility of the\nQFIM specifies whether or not the entire parameter vector\ncan be jointly estimated. In particular, estimators for θderived\nfrom measurement statistics of ρare underdetermined if Fρ\nis singular. When ρ(θ)is full-rank and has the form in (8),\nthe QFIM has entries\nFρ\nij=X\nk1\nλk∂λk\n∂θi∂λk\n∂θj. (11)\nThe QFIM establishes the quantum Cramèr-Rao bound\n(QCRB), which is described as follows. Any estimator ˆθ\nconstructed from measurement statistics of ρhas a covariance\nmatrix Σˆθ:Rn→Rnwhich holds the bound\nΣˆθ≥(Fρ)−1. (12)\nAn estimator is said to be efficient if its covariance matrix\nsatisfies the QCRB with equality.\nIII. S TATE DISTRIBUTION AND MEASUREMENT\nPROTOCOLS\nThe goal of quantum network tomography is to estimate\nlink parameters through end-to-end measurements. As any\nestimation process, quantum network tomography requires\nthe encoding of parameters in quantum states, which can be\nmeasured to obtain parameter statistics. Therefore,\nng of parameters in quantum states, which can be\nmeasured to obtain parameter statistics. Therefore, there are\nthree key steps that guide the analysis of quantum network\ntomography. It is necessary to design 1) state distribution\nprotocols capable of generating the required parametrized\nstates, 2) measurement protocols (POVMs) to be performed at\nthe nodes, and 3) estimators taking measurements as inputs.\nPrevious work defines solutions for the tomography problemwhere these three steps are done in unison [26]. This work\nprovides a more general description of network tomography\nprotocols, considering different state distribution and measure-\nments protocols as building blocks. In this section, we explore\nthese building blocks and devise state distribution protocols\nand measurements for QNT. Without loss of generality, the\nanalysis presented considers the case of bit-flip channels.\nNonetheless, the methods are easily generalized to any other\nchannel of the form in (1), i.e., a pure Zor pure Ychannel,\nthrough a change of basis.\nA. States and measurement probabilities in parametric forms\nIt is convenient to describe states in parametric forms\nfor the analysis presented in this section. Let ρ(θ)be an\nn-qubit density matrix that depends on parameter θ. The\nstates of interest are of the parametric form shown in (8),\nwhere the eigenvalues of the density matrix depend on θand\nthe eigenvectors do not. Such states can be represented by\ndescribing a probability function pρ:{0,1}n→[0,1]that\nmaps the binary label of an eigenvector to its corresponding\neigenvalue. In particular, pρ(s, θ) = λk(θ), where sis the\nbinary representation of the integer k. More precisely, Λkis\nitself a label representing a vector in a given basis Λover the\nHilbert space of nqubits. Thus, every index k∈Z+can be\nunderstood as an n-bit string s∈ {0,1}nuniquely specifying\na vector in the basis. Once basis Λis specified together\nwith an ordering for its states, a density matrix diagonal in\nΛcan be represented \npecified together\nwith an ordering for its states, a density matrix diagonal in\nΛcan be represented by the parametric function pρ(s, θ).\nThis characterization is useful for describing the probability\ndistribution of projective measurement outcomes of any state\nin an arbitrary basis. Applying the Born rule, the probability\ndistribution of measurement outcomes of a state ρin basis\nB={|bi⟩⟨bi|}has the form\npB\nρ(s, θ) =X\ns′∈{0,1}np(s′, θ)|⟨bi|Λk⟩|2, (13)\nwhere sands′are the binary representations of integers iand\nk, respectively.\nParametric forms of state eigenvalues yield the description\nof parametric forms for their measurement probabilities in\narbitrary bases. This description is interesting as it provides\na path for parameter estimation based on measurements of\na state in different bases. Throughout the remainder of this\narticle, we use the notation pB\nC(s, θ)to denote the probability\nof measuring label s∈ {0,1}nfrom a B-basis projective\nmeasurement performed in a state ρ(θ)distributed by a\nquantum circuit C. Moreover, pC(s, θ)denotes measurement\nprobabilities in the eigenbasis of ρ(θ)distributed by C. It\nis helpful to define the probability distribution function α:\n{0,1}n×[0,1]n→[0,1]in the form\nα(s, θ) =n−1Y\nj=0sjθj+sj(1−θj), (14)\nwhich represents a joint probability distribution of nindepen-\ndent binary random variables. In particular, θjand(1−θj)\nare the probabilities of observing the j-th bit of sassj= 0\nandsj= 1, respectively. The form of αprovides simple5\nState Label pM pRI\n|00⟩ 00 θ0θ1θ2+θ0θ1θ2θ1θ2\n|01⟩ 01 θ0θ1θ2+θ0θ1θ2θ1θ2\n|10⟩ 10 θ0θ1θ2+θ0θ1θ2θ1θ2\n|11⟩ 11 θ0θ1θ2+θ0θ1θ2θ1θ2\nTABLE I: Probability distribution of eigenbasis measurements\nforZ-diagonal states. For clarity, we denote (1−θj)asθj.\nestimators for θ. In particular, let S∈ {0,1}ndenote an n-\nbit random variable, with Sj∈ {0,1}denoting the its j-th\nrandom bit. It is possible to write an estimator for θjin the\nform ˆθj=ˆPr[Sj= 0] , where ˆPr[Sj= 0] is any estimator\nfor the probability that Sj= 0.\nB. Enc\nn the\nform ˆθj=ˆPr[Sj= 0] , where ˆPr[Sj= 0] is any estimator\nfor the probability that Sj= 0.\nB. Encoding network parameters in quantum states\nRemote state distribution is used in this work to generate\nquantum states of interest. Distribution of a quantum state from\nthe root to the leaves can be described in terms of a distributed\ncircuit implemented by the nodes of the network. The nodes\ninitialize quantum registers at the beginning of the distribution\nprocess. The links are used to communicate quantum infor-\nmation, which manifests either as the direct transmission of\nqubits (one-way architecture), or as the generation of Bell pairs\nbetween two nodes (two-way architecture). Local quantum\noperations are performed at the nodes, progressively trans-\nforming the joint initialized state into the desired output. By\nusing network links for communication, the final distributed\nstates depend on channel parameters and allow for parameter\ninference through measurements.\n1) Previous state distribution protocols: In previous work,\na general state distribution algorithm for network tomography\nwas defined under the restriction of a single channel use\nfor each distributed state [26]. The algorithm generated two\ndistribution circuits for the solution of tomography problems\nin star networks, which are of interest to this work. For the\nsake of completeness, we explicitly present the two distribution\ncircuits defined in [26]. For both circuits, consider v0to be\nthe node selected to initiate state distribution, i.e., the root.\nThe first distribution circuit, which is referred to as the\nMulticast (M) circuit in this work, distributes Z-diagonal\nstates. Node v0prepares a qubit in the pure-state |0⟩and sends\nit to node vn. Node vnreceives a qubit in a mixed state given\nthe action of channel E0. Then, a multi-target CNOT gate is\nperformed in vn, using the received mixed state as control and\nn−2newly initialized qubits in state |0⟩as targets. Each of\nthe outputs is transmitted to a leaf of\n\nn−2newly initialized qubits in state |0⟩as targets. Each of\nthe outputs is transmitted to a leaf of the star. The eigenvalues\nof the (n−1)-qubit density matrix describing the state of the\nqubits in the end-nodes have the parametric form\npM(s, θ) =θ0α(s, θ1:) + (1 −θ0)α(s, θ1:), (15)\nwhere s∈ {0,1}n−1,θ1:∈Rn−1is the vector [θ1, . . . , θ n−1],\nandαis given in (14). We expand pMfor a four-node star in\nTable I and show the Multicast distribution circuit for such a\nstar in Fig.2b.\nThe second algorithm distributes GHZ-diagonal states and\nis similar to the first with modifications in the operationsState Label pIE pBF\n|000⟩+|111⟩ 000 θ0θ1θ2θ0\u0000\nθ0θ1θ2+¯θ0¯θ1¯θ2\u0001\n|001⟩+|110⟩ 001 θ0θ1θ2θ0\u0000\nθ0θ1¯θ2+¯θ0¯θ1θ2\u0001\n|010⟩+|101⟩ 010 θ0θ1θ2θ0\u0000\nθ0¯θ1θ2+¯θ0θ1¯θ2\u0001\n|011⟩+|100⟩ 011 θ0θ1θ2θ0\u0000\nθ0¯θ1¯θ2+¯θ0θ1θ2\u0001\n|000⟩ − |111⟩ 100 θ0θ1θ2¯θ0\u0000\nθ0θ1θ2+¯θ0¯θ1¯θ2\u0001\n|001⟩ − |110⟩ 101 θ0θ1θ2¯θ0\u0000\nθ0θ1¯θ2+¯θ0¯θ1θ2\u0001\n|010⟩ − |101⟩ 110 θ0θ1θ2¯θ0\u0000¯θ0θ1θ2+¯θ0θ1¯θ2\u0001\n|011⟩ − |100⟩ 111 θ0θ1θ2¯θ0\u0000\nθ0¯θ1¯θ2+¯θ0θ1θ2\u0001\nTABLE II: Probability distribution of eigenbasis measure-\nments for GHZ-diagonal states.

The qubit received in\nvnis operated on with the one-qubit gate ZHZ , followed by\na mutli-target CNOT gate similar to the one used for the M\nalgorithm. The outputs of these gates are sent to the leaves of\nthe network. The GHZ-diagonal n-qubit state in the leaves of\nthe network has eigenvalues of the form\npIE(s, θ) =α(s, θ), (16)\nwhich are fully expanded in Table II for a four-node star. The\ndistribution circuit for this particular case is depicted in Fig.2d.\nNote that the probability function in (16) has the form of\na joint probability distribution of independent bin\nthe probability function in (16) has the form of\na joint probability distribution of independent binary random\nvariables, and the probabilities shown in the third column of\nTable II can be interpreted as follows: the label of each state\nis a three-qubit measurement outcome; for the i-th qubit, the\nprobabilities that the measured bit is one and zero are θiand\n(1−θi), respectively; finally, the joint measurement probability\nis the product of the individual probabilities, which comes\nfrom a global GHZ measurement at the end-nodes.\nThe examples shown in Tables I and II demonstrate the\ndifferences in parameter encoding obtained by distinct distri-\nbution circuits. Such differences manifest themselves in the\nfindings reported in [26], where estimators based on the M\ncircuit were not able to uniquely determine parameters, while\nthe ones based on the IE circuit were. These findings are\nrevisited in Section IV, where novel estimators combining\ndifferent states and measurements are introduced.\n2) New states for parameter encoding: We now present\ntwo new state distribution algorithms for tomography. The first\nalgorithm is denoted as the Root Independent (RI) algorithm,\nwhich is based on the general distribution protocol defined\nin [26] when applied to star networks. The root node starts\nby initializing a qubit in the pure state |+⟩and transmits it\nto the intermediate node. The channel connecting the root to\nthe intermediate node does not change the state of this qubit,\nsince|+⟩is an eigenvector of X. Therefore, the intermediate\nnode receives the pure state |+⟩, which undergoes the action\nof a Hadamard gate and a generalized (n−1)-qubit CNOT\ngate. Once the operations are finished, each qubit is sent to a6\n(a) Network.\n (b) Multicast.\n (c) Root-independent.\n(d) Independent Encoding.\n (e) Back-and-forth.\nFig. 2: State Distribution Circuits. Each circuit represents the operations performed at the nodes of a four-node star (a) to\ndistribute states for tomography. Colored blocks rep\nrformed at the nodes of a four-node star (a) to\ndistribute states for tomography. Colored blocks represent different nodes in the star. The gray block denotes node vn, while\nthe red, blue and green blocks denote nodes v0, v1,andv2, respectively. Vertical red-dashed lines denote the transmission of\nqubits through the channels in the network.\nleaf of the star. The RI distribution algorithm yields a Z-basis\ndiagonal, (n−1)-qubit state of the form\npRI(s, θ) =α(s1:, θ1:), (17)\nwhich is similar to (16), i.ejoint distribution of independent\nvariables, although with no dependency on θ0. This property\nmotivates the name of the algorithm, since θ0is the parameter\ndefining channel E0that interconnects the root to the interme-\ndiate node. The probability distribution in (17) is exemplified\nin the fourth column of Table I for a four-node star.\nThe second algorithm is denoted as the Back-and-Forth\n(BF) distribution circuit. In this protocol, the root transmits\na qubit to node vninitialized in the pure-state |0⟩. The\nintermediate node performs a GHZ generation circuit, applying\na Hadarmard gate to the qubit it received and using it as the\ncontrol of a multi-target CNOT gate. The output of the circuit\nis the GHZ-diagonal state\nρ(θ0) =θ0Φ00...0+ (1−θ0)Φ10...0. (18)\nIf a bit-flip occurs on the initial channel, the qubit received\nin the intermediate node is in state |1⟩. After the Hadarmard\ngate, the control used in the CNOT gate is in state |−⟩and\nthe output GHZ state will have a negative relative phase, i.e\nthe state Φ10...0. When a bit-flip does not occur, there is no\nrelative phase in the output GHZ state, i.e the state Φ00...0.\nThe qubit used for control is then sent back through the initial\nchannel, and each remaining qubit is sent to a particular leaf\nof the network through its respective link. The eigenvalues of\nthe GHZ-diagonal state in the end-nodes of the network have\nthe form\npBF(s, θ) =α(s0, θ0)pM(s, θ), (19)where pM(s, θ)is given in (14). The BF distribution circuit for\n\nm\npBF(s, θ) =α(s0, θ0)pM(s, θ), (19)where pM(s, θ)is given in (14). The BF distribution circuit for\na four-node star is shown in Fig.2e, and (19) is fully expanded\nin the fourth column of Table II for this case.\nC. Measurement protocols\nState distribution protocols are the first ingredient of quan-\ntum tomography protocols, since they provide quantum states\nthat depend on channel parameters. In order to assess the\ninformation contained in such states, it is necessary to perform\nquantum measurements. In the above cases, these measure-\nments refer to POVMs performed in the end nodes of the\nstar. Following the discussion presented in Section II-C, the\noptimal POVMs to extract statistics for estimation are pro-\njective measurements in the diagonal bases of the distributed\nstates, which are the bases that diagonalize the corresponding\nSLD opertors. States ρIEandρBFare diagonal in the GHZ\nbasis, and the corresponding optimal measurements are global\nGHZ-basis projective measurements in the end-nodes. Such\nmeasurements are significantly more challenging than local\nones, as they require distributed entanglement to be performed.\nTherefore, it is of interest to consider alternative non-optimal\nlocal measurements to obtain statistics for estimation when\nsuch states are considered. We now describe 1) optimal mea-\nsurements for the states presented and 2) local measurement\nstrategies for ρIEandρBF.\n1) Optimal measurements: The optimal measurement bases\nfor the states are shown in Table III. Since the states dis-\ntributed by the circuits described in the previous section were\nexpressed in their respective diagonal bases, the probability\ndistribution for optimal measurements were already specified\nby the functions pM, pIE, pRI,andpBF.\n2) Local measurements: The first strategy for both IE and\nBF is to measure the qubits in the end-nodes of the star in the\nZbasis.

The measurement probability distribution\nfor the state distributed by the IE protocol is obtained from\n(16) and has the form\npZ\nIE(s, θ) =1\n2pRI(s, θ), (20)\nwithpRIgiven in (17). This measurement distribution implies\nthat statistics obtained from local Zmeasurements in ρIE(θ)\ndo not depend on θ0. Similarly, the Z-basis measurement\nprobability for the BF state is derived from (19) and has the\nform\npZ\nBF(s, θ) =1\n2pM(s, θ), (21)\nwhere pMis given in (14). It is of interest to point out that\nthe dependency of pZ\nBFinθis qualitatively the same as that\nofpM. Hence, any estimator based on pM, such as the one\nspecified in [26], can use estimates for pZ\nBFto estimate θ.\nThe second strategy is to locally measure the qubits at\nthe end-nodes in the Xbasis. The probabilities in (6) can\nbe used with (13) to describe the measurement probabilities\nfor both IE and BF states. Interestingly, the two states have\nequal measurement probabilities in the Xbasis. Let s∈ {0,1}\ndenote the label of the measurement outcome in the Xbasis.\nThe measurement probabili\ns. Let s∈ {0,1}\ndenote the label of the measurement outcome in the Xbasis.\nThe measurement probability function has the form\npX\nIE(s, θ) =pX\nBF(s, θ) =1\n4α(β(s), θ0), (22)\nwhich depends exclusively on θ0, where β(s)is the parity\nfunction given in (7). This dependency shows that θ0can\nbe directly estimated from X-basis measurement outcomes of\neither state and, thus, that the first channel can be characterized\nfrom such measurements.\nIV.

The protocols are combined in\nthis section to construct complete tomography protocols. We\nnow present multiple protocols that use different combinations\nof state distribution and measurements to provide estimators\nfor all n-channel parameters in an arbitrary (n+ 1)-node star\nwith different efficiencies. Moreover, the estimators presented\nare evaluated in Section V both analytically, through their\nrespective QFIMs, and numerically, with the aid of simulation.\nWe categorize the tomography protocols presented in this\nsection based on the number of distinct state distribution pro-\ntocols and measurements used to obtain a unique description\nof the entire parameter vector. In particular, an estimator that\nrequires a number Sof state distribution circuits and Pof\nmeasurement protocols is an (S·P)-step protocol.\nA. Quantum network tomography and parameter estimation\nIn order to discuss the quantum network tomography pro-\ntocols proposed in this section, it is instrumental to formally\naddress how they are framed in the theory of quantum estima-\ntion. Complete network tomography protocols requir\n they are framed in the theory of quantum estima-\ntion. Complete network tomography protocols require, in the\ngeneral case, multiple copies of distinct states to be distributed\nand measured with various protocols. In quantum estimation\nproblems, a parameter-dependent state ρ(θ)is measured in\norder to estimate θ. We now discuss how the notion of multiple\nestimation steps fits into this perspective. Throughout this\ndiscussion, we use ρ∗to denote the joint state of multiple\ncopies of possibly different, multi-qubit quantum states that are\nthe input to the quantum estimation problem. The dependency\nofρ∗withθis omitted for simplicity.\nWe start with the analysis of one-step protocols, described\nby a single Q-qubit distribution circuit that generates a state\nρ(θ), and a single measurement protocol executed at the end-\nnodes. Let mbe the number of copies of ρ(θ)to be distributed\nto the end-nodes to obtain parameter-dependent statistics. The\ngoal is to construct an estimator ˆθ∈Rnforθ∈Rnusing a\nstateρ∗of the form\nρ∗=ρ(θ)⊗m, (23)\nwhere the superscript ⊗mdenotes the tensor product of ρ(θ)\nwith itself mtimes. Note that each copy of ρ(θ)is aQ-qubit\nstate spread across end-nodes. Consider that the projective\nmeasurement chosen for this one-step tomography protocol\nis determined by projectors {Π1, . . . , Π2Q}, with\nΠi=|πi⟩⟨πi|. (24)8\nThe dataset of observations to obtain statistics for the construc-\ntion of ˆθhas the form {s1, . . . , s m}, where each si∈ {0,1}Q\nis the Q-bit classical label denoting the i-th measurement\noutcome. It follows directly from the properties of the QFIM\nof separable states [31] that the QFIM of ρ∗has the form\nFρ∗=mFρ(θ). (25)\nNote that the measurement protocols described in Section III\nmeasure each copy of ρ(θ)independently. Therefore, no entan-\nglement is used across distinct copies of ρ(θ). Understanding\nthe additional power provided by the use of entanglement\nacross different copies to obtain estimators is a promising\nresearch direction for future wo\nglement\nacross different copies to obtain estimators is a promising\nresearch direction for future work.\nThe one-step case is crucial as it serves as the basis for the\ndiscussion of the general S·P-step estimation case introduced\nearlier. In particular, the combination of a distributed state and\na measurement protocol produces a state. Such a state is di-\nrectly obtained by applying a CPTP map that corresponds to a\nmeasurement operation of the distributed state in the specified\nbasis. Hence, consider a tomography protocol that uses one\ncircuit Cto distribute a Q-qubit state and two measurement\nstrategies ϖ1={Π1\n1, . . . , Π1\n2Q}andϖ2={Π2\n1, . . . , Π2\n2Q}to\nuniquely determine the parameters. We can represent the two\nscenarios by considering states of the form\nρj(θ) =2Q−1X\nq=0Πj\nqρ(θ)Πj\nq=2Q−1X\nq=0\nπj\nq\f\fρ(θ)\f\fπj\nq\u000B\nΠj\nq (26)\nj∈ {1,2}, and for which the QFIM can be computed.\nIn this case, the QFIM is the Classical Fisher Information\nMatrix (CFIM) obtained using the probability distribution of\nmeasurements in the ϖjbasis. Since projective measurements\nare considered, the QFIM is directly obtained from the scalar\nvalues\nπj\nq\f\fρ(θ)\f\fπj\nq\u000B\n, which are the probabilities in (13).\nMappings following (26) are helpful when multiple copies\nare considered. Suppose that m1andm2copies of ρ(θ)are\nmeasured in the ϖ1andϖ2bases, respectively. The state ρ∗\nthat characterizes the combined distributed copies has the form\nρ∗=ρ1(θ)⊗m1O\nρ2(θ)⊗m2, (27)\nand the dataset D={{s1\n1, . . . , s1\nm1},{s2\n1, . . . , s2\nm2}}of mea-\nsurement observations has a total of m1+m2entries with a\nsub-component for each state. In this case, the QFIM of ρ∗\nassumes the form\nFρ∗=m1Fρ1+m2Fρ2, (28)\nwhere the dependency in θis omitted for clarity.\nThis analysis is extended to the general case as follows.\nSuppose that a given estimation protocol uses a set of S\ndistributed states {ρ1(θ), . . . , ρ S(θ)}, and a set of Piprojective\nmeasurements {ϖi\n1, . . . , ϖi\nPi}for each state ρi(θ). By map-\nping each state-measureme\nprojective\nmeasurements {ϖi\n1, . . . , ϖi\nPi}for each state ρi(θ). By map-\nping each state-measurement pair to a state, we can represent\nthe set of distributed states as\nϱ={ρ11(θ), ρ12(θ), . . . , ρ SPS(θ)}, (29)\nwhich contains S∗=P\niPistates. In order to simplify the\nanalysis, we change the double index in (29) to a single indexranging from 1toS∗and consider that the set of distributed\nstates has the form\nϱ={ρ1(θ), . . . , ρ S∗(θ)}. (30)\nFurthermore, let midenote the number of copies of ρi(θ)that\nare measured for estimation. The density matrix representing\nthe combination of copies is given by\nρ∗=S∗O\ni=1ρi(θ)⊗mi, (31)\nand its QFIM has the form\nFρ∗=S∗X\ni=1miFρi. (32)\nDescribing the structure of the QFIM in the general case\nprovides a direct way to compare different quantum tomogra-\nphy protocols. Moreover, the separability of ρ∗facilitates the\nanalytical description of the QFIM. Its complexity reduces to\nthat of computing the QFIM of each ρiinϱand performing\na weighted sum of the results. We highlight that any QNT\nmethod can be understood using a similar analysis.\nB. Estimators\nWe now present the estimators that will be combined to\ndefine the complete QNT protocols. The estimators are written\nwith respect to probability outcomes based on the parametric\nrepresentation of states. These probabilities are themselves\nestimated based on datasets Dof measurement outcomes.\nThus, let Sρ,Bdenote a random variable representing the\nmeasurement outcome of a single copy of state ρin the\nbasis B. A dataset DB,m\nρ={sρ,B\n1, . . . , sρ,B\nm}formed by the\noutcomes of B-basis measurements performed in mcopies of\nρis the realization of SB\nρmtimes. If the Bis omitted in\nthe superscript, the symbols refer to the case of measurements\nperformed in the diagonal basis of density operators.\n1) M-state based estimators: The probability distribution\npM(s, θ)in (15) was used in [26] to provide two vector\nestimates for θ, that are based on two different estimates for\nθ0. We focus on the relationshi\nector\nestimates for θ, that are based on two different estimates for\nθ0. We focus on the relationship between ˆθjandˆθ0that has\nthe form\nˆθj=ˆPr[Sj−1= 1]−ˆθ0\n1−2ˆθ0,forj \u003E0. (33)\nGiven an estimate ˆθ0̸= 1/2,ˆθjforj \u003E0can be estimated\nby taking\nˆPr[Sj−1= 1] = 1 −1\nmmX\ni=1sM\ni(j−1), (34)\nwhere the j−1indices appear because ρMis an n−1qubit\nstate.9\n2) IE-state based estimators: The IE state is special in\nthe sense that the probability distributions of measurements\nin the GHZ, X, and Z basis are all represented by the joint\ndistribution of independent binary random variables. Using\n(16), (20), and (22) together yields\nˆθj= 1−1\nmmX\ni=1sIE\nij, j∈ {0, . . . , n −1}, (35)\nˆθj= 1−1\nmmX\ni=1sIE,Z\ni0⊕sIE,Z\nij, j∈ {1, . . . , n −1},(36)\nˆθ0= 1−1\nmmX\ni=1β(sIE,X\nij), (37)\nwhere ⊕denote the addition module-two operator.\n3) RI estimators: The RI estimators follow (36), since the\nprobability distribution in (17) is also a joint probability of\nindependent variables that does not depend on θ0, and ρRIis\ndiagonal in the Zbasis.\n4) BF estimators: From (22), estimators for ˆθ0using X-\nbasis measurements for ρBFhave the form in (37). When Z\nbasis measurements are performed, the probability distribution\nof outcomes reduces to pMwith a normalization coefficient\nof1/2. Thus, using an estimate for ˆθ0, an estimator for ˆθjcan\nbe obtained from (33) by substituting ˆPr[Sj]with\n1−1\nmmX\ni=1sBF,Z\ni0⊕sBF,Z\nij,forj∈ {1, . . . , n −1}.(38)\nFor GHZ measurements, the estimators still follow (34) and\n(37), although the probabilities are computed from Dm\nBF=\n{sBF\ni}.\nC. Tomography protocols\nWe combine the estimators to obtain multiple protocols that\ncompletely characterize bit-flip stars.\n1) One-step protocols: We discuss two one-step protocols.\nThe first protocol was introduced in [26], and uses the IE\ndistribution circuit with GHZ measurements yielding estima-\ntors following (35). In particular, the IE state is distributed\nmtimes and each GHZ measurement yields an observation\ncontaining information abou\nate is distributed\nmtimes and each GHZ measurement yields an observation\ncontaining information about all parameters. The second pro-\ntocol uses the BF distribution algorithm mtimes with GHZ\nmeasurements, obtaining ˆθ0from (37), and using (34) for each\nj∈ {1, . . . , n −1}to obtain ˆθj. Note that equations of the\nform (34) have a singularity when ˆθ0= 1/2and estimators\nbased on such equations are not well-defined when θ0= 1/2.\n2) Two-step protocols: Both IE and BF states lead to two-\nstep protocols using measurements in the ZandXbasis. Thus,\nin each case, the end-nodes distribute mcopies of the state,\nandm/2Z- and X-basis measurements are performed. In both\ncases, ˆθ0is obtained from (37), while ˆθjforj∈ {1, . . . , n −\n1}is obtained from (36) and (34) for the IE and BF states,\nrespectively.\nWe combine the RI and M distribution circuits into the\nfollowing two-step protocol. First, node v0is used as the root\nof the RI circuit to distribute m/2copies of ρRI, which are\nmeasured in the Zbasis. The copies provide estimators forˆθjforj∈ {1, . . . , n −1}of the form in (36). Secondly,\nthe M circuit is used with v0as the root, and (34) is used\nonce for each ˆθjto obtain n−1initial estimates ˆθ1\n0, . . . , ˆθn−1\n0\nforθ0. The final estimate returned for θ0assumes the form\nˆθ0=Pn−1\ni=1ˆθi\n0/(n−1).\n3)n-step protocol: The RI circuit leads to the following\nn-step protocol. Let mbe the number of states distributed.\nEach end-node vjin the star is used as the root for the RI\ncircuit m/n times. When vjis the root, the state distributed\ndoes not depend on θj. Hence, (n−1)m/n states among the\ntotal mdistributed depend on θj. The estimator in (36) can\nbe combined for each vk̸=vjto obtain an estimator of the\nform\nˆθj= 1−n\nm(n−1)X\ns∈Djsj, (39)\nwhere Djdenotes the combined dataset of the (n−1)m/n\nRI circuits performed with all end-nodes vk̸=vjas root, and\nsjdenotes the measurement bit obtained in vjonce a sample\nis locally measured in the Zbasis.\nV. E VALUATION\nThe six protocols presented \ned in vjonce a sample\nis locally measured in the Zbasis.\nV. E VALUATION\nThe six protocols presented in Section IV depict the diverse\nspace of solutions for the tomography of quantum bit-flip net-\nworks. In this section, we numerically evaluate and compare\nthe performance of all six protocols discussed.\nWe start with a numerical analysis of the QFIM inverse\nfor each tomography protocol. The QCRB, (12), implies that\nthe trace of the QFIM’s inverse is a lower bound on the sum\nof the variances of estimators. In particular, Tr\u0002\nF−1\u0003\nlower\nbounds the sum of the variances of entries ˆθjof any estimator\nˆθobtained from measurements of ρ. The states distributed for\ntomography have QFIMs following (11) and, as discussed in\nSection IV, the combined copies of states and measurements\nare captured by QFIMs following (32). Let θ∗∈[0,1]denote a\nfixed probability value. For each QNT protocol P, we compute\nTr\u0002\nF∗−1\u0003\nwhen mstates are distributed to obtain one estimate\nˆθof the entire parameter vector θ, for a four-node star with\nuniform bit flip probability, i.e., θj=θ∗forj∈ {0,1,2}. An\nn-step protocol requires nstates to be distributed to obtain a\nsingle estimate ˆθ. Therefore, we use m= 6for every protocol,\nsince six is the least common multiple of the number of states\nrequired by the protocols in a four-node star.\nOur results are reported in Figure 3a. Interestingly, the\ncurves highlight that the relative behavior of the inverse\ntrace changes based on θ∗. In particular, BF- and M-based\nprotocols exhibit lower QCRBs when θ∗is far from 1/2, and\nlarge bounds when close, while RI- and IE-based protocols\nshow a smoother relationship with θ∗. Furthermore, the one-\nstep BF protocol yields the lowest QCRB when θ∗is either\nclose to zero or one, while the one-step IE protocol has the\nlowest bound for most of the parameter regime. The curves\nalso highlight the advantages provided by entanglement in\nestimation vary according to the parameter values, which\nhas been previoulsy reported in [29] f\nt in\nestimation vary according to the parameter values, which\nhas been previoulsy reported in [29] for the point-to-point\nestimation of depolarizing channels.\nTo further our analysis, we simulate the QNT protocols\nusing Netsquid [30]. We study four-node networks with10\n(a) QFIM’s inverse trace per parameter value.\n (b) Estimation error per number of samples.\nFig. 3: Numerical evaluation of estimation performance for the QNT protocols presented in Section IV-C when applied to the\ncharacterization of a four-node star with channels of equal bit-flip probability θ∗.(a)Trace of F−1perθ∗. Since the QFIMs\nare symmetric with respect to 0.5, we only show the second half of the parameter region. Each protocol distributes a total of\nm= 6states to estimate θ, which is the least common multiple of the minimum number of states required for the protocols to\nestimate ˆθ.(b)Estimation error ∥ˆθ−θ∗∥per number of states used for estimation for a bit-flip star with θ∗= 0.58, averaged\nover 5 trials. The x-axis varies in increments of 6, ranging from m= 36 tom= 2024 .\nθ∗= 0.58, and compute the norm ∥ˆθ−θ∗∥to analyze\nthe convergence behavior of the estimators with the number\nof distributed states used for estimation. Figure. 3b shows\nresults for the case when the number of states used by each\nprotocol is varied from 36 to 2024, averaged over five trials.\nAs expected, two distinct groupings appear, with the BF- and\nM- based protocols reporting a significantly higher variance\nthan the rest of the protocols. This grouping agrees with our\ntheoretical expectations given the QCRBs shown in Figure 3a\nforθ∗= 0.58. The combined evaluation of the QCRBs and\nthe convergence behavior of estimators is a first step towards\nthe rigorous benchmarking of QNT protocols. Our findings\nprovide evidence that the performance of QNT methods can\ndepend on the values of parameters to be estimated, offering\ninitial insights to the design of optimal QNT protocols. In\nparticular, it paves the way for adaptive QNT meth\nsights to the design of optimal QNT protocols. In\nparticular, it paves the way for adaptive QNT methods that\ndynamically modify estimation strategy based on current pa-\nrameter estimates in order to exploit the distinct efficiencies\nof protocols with parameter values.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nThe results reported in this article further the end-to-end\ncharacterization of bit-flip quantum stars. We reviewed the\nmethods proposed in [26] and provided novel QNT protocols\nthat utilize multiple state distribution protocols and measure-\nments. The proposed protocols uniquely characterize bit-flip\nprobabilities in quantum star networks by exploiting both\nlocal and global network measurements, achieving varying\nestimation efficiency. Moreover, the QFIM analysis presented\nin this article is general and provides new insights in the design\nof QNT protocols. The numerical evaluation of the trace of\nthe QFIM’s inverse shed light on entanglement advantagesfor QNT. In particular, our findings show that the proposed\nQNT protocols which do not rely on global measurements ex-\nhibit comparable performance to the ones that use pre-shared\nentanglement to perform measurements at the end-nodes.\nThus, determining the conditions under which entanglement\nyields optimal QNT methods and provides significant quantum\nadvantage is a fundamental research question that we identify\nas future work. Furthermore, the results presented in this\narticle are stepping stones toward the goal of devising QNT\nprotocols for the characterization of quantum star networks\nformed by arbitrary Pauli channels. Uniquely determining\nprobabilities for this general case is considerably harder than\nthe bit-flip scenario considered in this work. Nonetheless, the\nstate distribution schemes proposed serve as inspiration to\nthe inquiry of efficient parameter encoding schemes for the\ncharacterization of generic Pauli noise.\nWe identify the analysis of QNT protocols under the as-\nsumption of imperfect network hardware as a key direction \ne analysis of QNT protocols under the as-\nsumption of imperfect network hardware as a key direction for\nfuture work. The protocols developed in this article assume\nthat nodes have access to perfect quantum operations and\nmemories, disregarding the effects of operation noise in the\nend-to-end estimation of link parameters. Understanding the\nlimits of end-to-end network characterization in the face of\nnoise is fundamental for the development of useful QNT\nprotocols, as it can help guide the development of quantum\nnetwork management tools to inform protocol designers and\nnetwork managers.\nAcknowledgments —This research was supported in part by\nthe NSF grant CNS-1955744, NSF- ERC Center for Quan-\ntum Networks grant EEC-1941583, and MURI ARO Grant\nW911NF2110325.11\nREFERENCES\n[1] Harry Buhrman and Hein Röhrig.

NBP decoder unfolds the\nBP iterations into a deep neural network (DNN), and the parameters of the DNN are trained in a\ndata-driven manner. Neural Normalized Min-Sum (NNMS) and Offset min-sum (OMS) decoders\nwith learnable offsets are other adaptations requiring fewer learnable parameters than the NBP\ndecoder. In this paper, we study the generalization capabilities of the neural decoder when the\ncheck node messages are scaled by parameters that are learned by optimizing over the training\ndata. Specifically, we show the dependence of the generalization gap (i.e., the difference between\nempirical and expected BER) on the block length, message length, variable/check node degrees,\ndecoding iterations, and the training dataset size.\nINTRODUCTION\n1Machine learning has emerged as an important tool for channel encoding and channel decoding.\nDeep neural networks and reinforcement learning have shown better decoding performance at a\ngiven channel signal-to-noise ratio [1, 2, 3, 4]. In another line of work, deep neural networks have\nbeen combined with prototypical decoding algorithms to enhance decoding performance when\nthe true channel state information is unavailable [5, 6]. Additionally, it is worth noting that deep\nneural networks and reinforcement learning algorithms have demonstrated comparable decoding\nperformance to contemporary algorithms but with lower complexity [4, 7].\nIterative decoding algorithms, such as belief propagation (BP), are commonly utilized for decoding\nlinear codes. They are typically considered equivalent to m\n(BP), are commonly utilized for decoding\nlinear codes. They are typically considered equivalent to maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding\nwhen the Tanner graph does not contain short cycles [8]. However, in the presence of short cycles\nwithin the Tanner graph, BP may prove to be sub-optimal [9, 10]. To address this issue, the Neural\n1This work was supported by NSF grants CAREER 1651492, CCF-2100013, CNS-2317192, CNS-2209951, CNS-\n1822071, CIF- 1855879, CCSS-2027844, CCSS-2052751, and NSF-ERC 1941583. Bane Vasi ´c was also supported by\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration and funded through JPL’s Strategic University Research Partnerships (SURP) Program. Bane\nVasi´c has disclosed an outside interest in Codelucida to the University of Arizona. Conflicts of interest resulting from\nthis interest are being managed by The University of Arizona in accordance with its policies.\n1Belief Propagation (NBP) decoder was introduced as a technique to mitigate the impact of short\ncycles [11]. The fundamental concept behind NBP involves scaling the variable node messages,\nwith the weights or scaling factors being learned in a data-driven manner. Other adaptations of\nNeural Belief Propagation have been proposed [12], where the authors suggest scaling the check\nnode messages instead. Moreover, another approach suggested in [13] involves the use of offsets\nin the check node messages to reduce the number of multiplications. These offsets are also learned\nin a data-driven manner.\nUnderstanding the relationship between the generalization gap, which is the difference between\nthe training bit error rate and the test bit error rate on unseen samples, and various parameters such\nas blocklength, message length, code-rate, and channel SNR, holds significant importance in the\nfield of channel decoding. In our recent work [14], it was proved that the generalization gap of\nneural belief propagation f\ng. In our recent work [14], it was proved that the generalization gap of\nneural belief propagation follows a linear scaling pattern with decoding iterations and variable node\ndegree, with a mild dependence on the blocklength. Moreover, it was found that the generalization\ngap decreases as the training dataset size increases. Importantly, these empirical observations were\nconsistent across various parity check matrices, aligning with the theoretical findings.\nThe proof techniques employed in [14] incorporated the PAC-learning approach and leveraged\nRademacher complexity tools to establish explicit dependencies on various factors, including the\ndecoder parameters, training dataset size, and channel SNR. Nonetheless, there are other alterna-\ntive approaches exist for bounding the generalization gap. Within the literature, methods such as\ncomputing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension or computing the Rademacher complexity\nof the function class have been recognized as viable approaches for upper bounding the generaliza-\ntion gap [15]. Another notable technique is PAC-Bayes analysis, which bounds the generalization\ngap by quantifying the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and posterior distributions\nof the learned weights. We next state the main contribution of this paper.\nMain Contributions: In this paper, we present an extension of the results established in [14] per-\ntaining to Neural Belief Propagation. Our aim is to derive comprehensive bounds for the general-\nization gap for neural normalized min-sum decoders (NNMS) and neural offset min-sum decoders\n(NOMS), specifically by considering the scaling of check node messages. Employing the PAC-\nlearning approach, we explore the relationship between the generalization gap and various factors\nsuch as the number of decoding iterations, the size of the training dataset, and the characteristics\nof the parity check matrix, encompassing blocklength, message length, variable node degree, and\ncheck node degree.\nSYST\n matrix, encompassing blocklength, message length, variable node degree, and\ncheck node degree.\nSYSTEM MODEL\nIn Fig. 1, we consider a linear block code denoted as Cwith a block length of nand a message\nlength of k.

Here, dvrepresents\nthe column weight in the parity check matrix, i.e., the number of parity checks a variable node\nparticipates in. The edge connecting variable node vito parity check node pjin Tanner graph G\nis denoted as {vi, pj}.V(vj) ={pi|H[i, j] = 1}denote the set of parity check nodes adjacent to\nthe variable node vjin the Tanner graph G. Similarly, P(pi) ={vj|H[i, j] = 1}denote the set of\nvariable nodes adjacent to the parity check node piinG.\nLetY ⊆Rnbe the space of ndimensional channel outputs, X ⊆ { 0,1}nbe the space of

node layer.\ndimensional codewords, U ⊆ { 0,1}kbe the space of kdimensional messages, and Z ⊆Rnbe the\nspace of ndimensional channel noise. The message u= [u[1],···,u[k]]⊤∈ U is encoded to the\ncodeword x= [x[1],···,x[n]]⊤∈ X . The channel is assumed to be memoryless, described by\nPr(y|x) =Qn\ni=1Pr(y[i]|x[i]). The receiver receives the channel output y= [y[1],···,y[n]]⊤∈\nY; which is the codeword xmodulated, and corrupted with additive noise z= [z[1],···,z[n]]⊤∈\nZ. The goal of the decoder is to recover the message ufrom the channel output y. The input to\nthe decoder is the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the posterior probabilities denoted by λ∈Rn×1\nand is given as λ[i] = logPr(x[i]=0|y[i])\nPr(x[i]=1|y[i]), for 1≤i≤n. Denote the output of the NNMS decoder\nwithTdecoding iterations as ˆ x=f(λ), where f(·)denotes the decoding function.\nSimilar to the NBP decoder, each decoding iteration t(where, 1≤t≤T) in the NNMS\ndecoder corresponds to two hidden layers each of width |E|=ndv, namely: (1) variable layer vt,\n(2) parity check layer pt. The output of the node vt[{l, m}]in the NNMS decoder corresponds to\nthe message passed from variable node vlto parity check node pmin the t-th iteration, and is,\nvt[{l, m}] =λ[l] +X\nm′∈V(l)\\mpt−1[{l, m′}], (1)\nwhere, pt−1[{l, m′}]corresponds to the message passed from the parity check node pm′to the\nvariable node vlin the (t−1)-th iteration. The output of the parity check layer in the min-sum\ndecoder is given as follows,\npt[{l, m}] =Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}]) min\nl′∈P(m)\\l|vt[{l′, m}]|. (2)\nHowever, the messages from the hidden layer that performs parity checks can be scaled, and the\ncorresponding decoder is called th\ne hidden layer that performs parity checks can be scaled, and the\ncorresponding decoder is called the neural normalized min-sum decoder. The output of the parity\ncheck hidden layer in the t-th decoding iteration for the NNMS decoder is,\npt[{l, m}] =βt[{l, m}]Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}])˜ pt[{l, m}]. (3)\nwhere, ˜ pt[{l, m}] = min\nl′∈P(m)\\l|vt[{l′, m}]|andβtare learned in a data-driven manner. The output\nof the parity check hidden layer in the t-th decoding iteration for NOMS decoder is,\npt[{l, m}] =Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}])reLu (˜ pt[{l, m}]−βt[{l, m}]). (4)\n3The estimated codeword after Tdecoding iterations in the NNMS decoder is given as,\nˆ x[l] =s(W(T)\n2[l, l]λ[l] +X\nm′∈V(l)W(T)\n1[l,{l, m′}]pT[{l, m′}]) (5)\nwhere, s(·)is the sigmoid activation. The weights and the scaling factors are learnt by training the\nNNMS decoder (denoted by f(·)) to minimize the bit error rate (BER) loss that is defined as,\nlBER(f(λ),x) =dH(f(λ),x)\nn=Pn\nj=1 1(f(λ)[j]̸=x[j])\nn. (6)\nHere, dH(·,·)denotes the Hamming distance, and 1(·)denotes the indicator function. In prac-\ntice, we train the NNMS decoder to minimize the BER loss over the dataset S={(λj,xj)}m\nj=1\ncomprising of pairs of log-likelihood ratio and its corresponding codeword. Then, we define the\nempirical risk of fasˆRBER(f) =1\nmmP\nj=1lBER(f(λj),xj). The true risk of fis defined as RBER(f) =\nEλ,x[lBER(f(λ),x)]. The generalization gap is defined as the difference RBER(f)−ˆRBER(f).\nMAIN RESULTS\nIn this section, we present our main findings regarding the generalization gap analysis for NNMS\ndecoders. We consider the training dataset, denoted as S={(λj,xj)}m\nj=1, and let FTbe the class\nof NNMS decoders with Tdecoding iterations. We make the assumption that the scaling factors of\nthe check node messages are bounded. Specifically, for every (l, m)pair, we have βt[{l, m}]≤w;\nor the 2-norm ∥βt[{l, m}]∥2is bounded as ∥βt[{l, m}]∥2≤Bβ. Similarly, for the weight matrices,\nthe maximum absolute value of the (i, j)coordinates for all weight m\nlarly, for the weight matrices,\nthe maximum absolute value of the (i, j)coordinates for all weight matrices is bounded by a non-\nnegative constant w. In other words, we have |W1[i, j]| ≤wand|W2[i, j]| ≤w.W1is strictly\nan upper triangular matrix with exactly dvnon-zero entries in every row, while W2is a diagonal\nmatrix. We express the bounded norms for any j−th row vector in matrices W1andW2asBw1\nandBw2, respectively. Furthermore, we assume a bound on the input log-likelihood ratios, such\nthat|λ[i]| ≤bλfor all i= 1, . . . , n . To quantify the complexity of the function class FT, we adopt\nthe notion of bit-wise Rademacher complexity, as defined in [14]. It is formulated as follows:\nRm(FT[j])≜E\nσ\"\nsup\nf∈FT1\nmmX\ni=1σi·f(λi)[j]#\n(7)\nwhere σi’s are i.i.d. Rademacher random variables, i.e., Pr(σi= 1) = Pr( σi=−1) =1\n2. The\nbit-wise Rademacher complexity captures the correlation between the j-th channel output of the\nNNMS decoder and the Rademacher random variable. Leveraging results from standard PAC-\nlearning techniques, we use the upper bound on the generalization gap for any δ∈(0,1)with\nprobability at least 1−δ, as follows:\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤1\nnnX\nj=1Rm(FT[j]) +r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m, (8)\nIn the subsequent theorem, we present the key outcome of our study, where we establish an upper\nbound on the bit-wise Rademacher complexity term by utilizing PAC-learning techniques.

degree\n(dv).\nallows us to explicitly capture the dependence on code parameters, the number of decoding itera-\ntions, and the size of the training dataset.\nTheorem 1. For any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1−δ, the generalization gap for any\nNNMS decoder f∈ F Tcan be upper bounded as follows,\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤4\nm+r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m+ 12r\nndv(T+ 1)2\nmlog\u0000\n8√mnwd vbλ\u0001\n, (9)\nwhere ndenotes the blocklength, dvis the variable node degree, Tis the number of decoding\niterations (number of layers in NNMS decoder), mis the training dataset size; wandbλare uppe\necoding\niterations (number of layers in NNMS decoder), mis the training dataset size; wandbλare upper\nbounds on the weights in the NNMS decoder and input log-likelihood ratio, respectively.\nProof-sketch of Theorem 1: The detailed proof of Theorem 1 can be found in the Appendix\nand closely follows the proof of the generalization bounds for NBP decoders [14]. Our approach\ninvolves upper bounding the bit-wise Rademacher complexity using the Dudley entropy integral,\nwhere the bound depends on the covering number of the function class FT. Informally, the cov-\nering number represents the minimum size of a set that can effectively approximate all members\nof the function class FT. We upper bound the covering number of FTby considering the product\nof covering numbers of the weights and the scaling factors. This is based on the observation that\nthe NNMS decoder is Lipschitz with respect to its weights and scaling factors. In what follows,\nwe evaluate the covering number of the weights and scaling factors and express it as a function of\nthe number of parameters and the bounds on the weights and scaling factors. By combining these\nsteps, we derive the result in Theorem 1.\n5Remark 1 (Generalization Gap Bounds Comparison of NNMS and NBP Decoders ).As seen\nin Fig. 2 generalization gap bound of NNMS decoder exhibits an inverse relationship with the\ntraining dataset size, diminishing according to O(1/√m). The generalization gap grows linearly\nwith the number of decoding iterations, scaling as O(T). Additionally, the generalization gap\nis influenced by the blocklength nand the variable node degree dv, and scales as O(√n)and\nO(√dv), respectively. Notably, it is worth mentioning that the generalization gap observed in\nNBP decoders, as described in [14], displays a linear dependency on the variable node degree,\ncharacterized by O(dv). This is due to the fact that each extrinsic message (i.e., the message from\nthe variable node to the check node) in the NBP decoder is scaled by distinct \n.e., the message from\nthe variable node to the check node) in the NBP decoder is scaled by distinct weights when incident\non different parity check nodes. Conversely, in the NNMS decoder, each message from the parity\ncheck node is scaled by a single scaling factor, resulting in a reduced number of parameters and\ncausing the generalization gap to depend on dvasO(√dv).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, we have investigated the generalization capabilities of neural decoders, specifically\nfocusing on the adaptation of Neural Normalized Min-Sum (NNMS). Our analysis involved scal-\ning the check node messages using learned parameters optimized during training. We explored the\nimpact of various factors, including block length, message length, variable/check node degrees,\ndecoding iterations, and training dataset size, on the generalization gap which is a measure of the\ndisparity between empirical and expected bit error rates (BER). By comparing the generalization\ngap bounds of the NNMS decoder with those of the NBP decoder, we observed that the gap for\nNNMS decoder has a mild dependence on the column weight in the parity check matrix (or vari-\nable node degree). Extending the current framework to study the generalization gap of different\ntypes of machine learning-based codes/decoders (beyond belief propagation) is an important future\ndirection.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F.

Telgarsky, “Spectrally-normalized margin bounds for\nneural networks,” Advances in neural information processing systems , vol. 30, 2017.\n7PROOF OF THEOREM 1\nWe employ a PAC-Learning approach to establish an upper bound on the bit-wise Rademacher\ncomplexity term Rm(FT[j])in terms of training dataset size mand the spectral norm of the weight\nmatrices of the NNMS decoder. This approach is inspired by the reasoning used in generalization\nbound results for graph neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and NBP decoders presented\nin [16, 17, 14]. We adopt Lemma A.5. in [18] to bound the bit-wise Rademacher complexity as,\nRm(FT[j])≤inf\nα\u003E0\n4α√m+12\nm√mZ\nαp\nlogN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)dϵ\n. (10)\nwhere, N(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)is the covering number of the function class FT. To upper bound the\ncovering number, we show in Lemma 1 that the NNMS decoder is Lipschitz in its weights and\nscaling factors. In other words, we have that,\n∥f(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]∥2≤ρw2∥W2[j,:]−W′\n2[j\nts weights and\nscaling factors. In other words, we have that,\n∥f(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]∥2≤ρw2∥W2[j,:]−W′\n2[j,:]∥2+ρw1∥W1[j,:]−W′\n1[j,:]∥2 (11)\n+TX\ni=1ρβi∥βi−β′\ni∥2.\nwhere, ρw2,ρw1,ρβ1,···,ρβTare Lipschitz parameters are given as,\nρw2=bλ; ρw1=Bβ \n√nbλ \nBT−1\nβ−1\nBβ−1!\n+BT−1\nβp\nndvbλ!\n;\nρβi= (ndvBβ)T−i \n√nbλ \nBi−1\nβ−1\nBβ−1!\n+Bi−1\nβp\nndvbλ!\n. (12)\nTherefore, the covering number N(FT[j], ϵ,∥·∥2)can be upper-bounded by the product of covering\nnumber of the weight matrices and the scaling factors as,\nN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤N(W1[j,:],ϵ\n(T+ 2)ρw1,∥ · ∥ 2)× N(W2[j,:],ϵ\n(T+ 2)ρw2,∥ · ∥ 2)\n×TY\ni=1N(βi,ϵ\n(T+ 2)ρβi,∥ · ∥ 2) (13)\nThe covering number of the weights and the scaling factors of the NNMS decoder ffor1≤i≤T\ncan be bounded as follows,\nN(W1[j,:],ϵ\n(T+ 2)ρw1,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +2(T+ 2)Bw1ρw1\nϵ\u0013dv\nN(W2[j,:],ϵ\n(T+ 2)ρw2,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +2(T+ 2)Bw2ρw2\nϵ\u0013\nN(βi,ϵ\n(T+ 2)ρβi,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +2(T+ 2)Bβρβi\nϵ\u0013ndv\n(14)\n8Substituting (14) in (13), we can loosely upper bound the product of the covering numbers as,\nN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +2(T+ 2)ndvwbλ\nϵ\u0013(T+1)2ndv\n(15)\nComputing the integral of the covering number, and substituting in (10), we can obtain the upper\nbound on the generalization gap as,\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤4\nm+r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m+ 12r\nndv(T+ 1)2\nmlog\u0000\n8√mnwd vbλ\u0001\n, (16)\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 1.\nLIPSCHITZNESS OF NNMS DECODER\nLemma 1. Fornlength codeword, the bit-wise output of the NNMS decoder f∈ F Tis Lipschitz\nin its weight matrices W1,W2and scaling factors β1,···,βTsuch that,\n∥f(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]∥2≤ρw2∥W2[j,:]−W′\n2[j,:]∥2+ρw1∥W1[j,:]−W′\n1[j,:]∥2\n+TX\ni=1ρβi∥βi−β′\ni∥2.\nThe coefficients ρw2,ρw1,ρβ1,···,ρβTare as follows:\nρw2=bλ; ρw1=Bβ \n√nbλ \nBT−1\nβ−1\nBβ−1!\n+BT−1\nβp\nndvbλ!\n;\nρβi= (ndvBβ)T−i \n√nbλ \nBi−1\nβ−1\nBβ−1!\n+Bi−1\nβp\nndvbλ!\n(17)\nProof. For outputs f(λ)andf′(λ), respectively we consider the following parameter sets: (a)\nW1,W2,β1,···,βT, and (b) W′\n1,W′\n2,β′\n1,···,β′\nT. For the j-th output in the NNMS decoder,\nwe have that,\n∥f(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]∥2=∥s(W2[j,:]λ[j] +W1[j,:]pT)−s(W′\n2[j,:]λ[j] +W′\n1[j\ne NNMS decoder,\nwe have that,\n∥f(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]∥2=∥s(W2[j,:]λ[j] +W1[j,:]pT)−s(W′\n2[j,:]λ[j] +W′\n1[j,:]p′\nT)∥2\n≤ ∥(W2[j,:]−W′\n2[j,:])λ[j] +W1[j,:]pT−W′\n1[j,:]pT+W′\n1[j,:]pT−W′\n1[j,:]p′\nT∥2\n≤ ∥(W2[j,:]−W′\n2[j,:])λ[j]∥2+∥(W1[j,:]−W′\n1[j,:])pT∥2+∥W′\n1[j,:] (pT−p′\nT)∥2\n≤ ∥W2[j,:]−W′\n2[j,:]∥2bλ+∥pT∥2∥W1[j,:]−W′\n1[j,:]∥2+Bw1∥pT−p′\nT∥2. (18)\nTo further upper bound ∥pT∥2, we have that, ∥pT∥2=∥βT˜pT∥2≤ ∥βT∥2∥˜ pT∥2. Furthermore,\nwe know from Lemma 2 that ∥˜ pT∥2≤ ∥vT∥2. The norm ∥vT∥2can be upper bounded as follows,\n∥˜ pT∥2≤ ∥vT∥2=∥λ+βT−1˜ pT−1∥2\n≤ ∥λ∥2+∥βT−1˜ pT−1∥2\n≤√nbλ+Bβ∥˜ pT−1∥2. (19)\n9We can further upper bound ∥˜ pT∥2in terms of ∥˜ pT−2∥2as,\n∥˜ pT∥2≤√nbλ+Bβ\u0000√nbλ+Bβ∥˜ pT−2∥2\u0001\n(20)\nBy recursively upper bounding across Tdecoding iterations, we obtain the upper bound on ∥˜ pT∥2\nin terms of ∥˜ p1∥2as,\n∥˜ pT∥2≤√nbλ\u0000\n1 +Bβ+···+BβT−2\u0001\n+BT−1\nβ∥˜ p1∥2 (21)\nWe can upper bound ∥˜ p1∥2in terms of ∥v1∥2as∥˜ p1∥2≤ ∥v1∥2, and∥v1∥2can be upper bounded\nas∥v1∥2≤√ndvbλ.

Often, phonons are \nsources of noise and decoherence, since they can interact with a variety of solid -state \nquantum sys tems. To mitigate this, quantum systems typically operate at milli -\nKelvin temperatures to reduce the number of thermal phonons. Here we \ndemonstrate an alternative approach that relies on engineering phononic density of \nstates, drawing inspiration from phot onic bandgap structures that have been used \nto control the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters. We design and fabricate \ndiamond phononic crystals with a complete phononic bandgap spanning 50 - 70 \ngigahertz, tailored to suppress interactions of a singl e silicon -vacancy color center \nwith resonant phonons of the thermal bath. At 4 Kelvin, we demonstrate a reduction \nof the phonon -induced orbital relaxation rate of the color center by a factor of 18 \ncompared to bulk. Furthermore, we show that the phononic b andgap can efficiently \nsuppress phonon -color center interactions up to 20 Kelvin. In addition to enabling \noperation of quantum memories at higher temperatures, the ability to engineer \nqubit -phonon interactions may enable new functionalities for quantum sci ence and \ntechnology, where phonons are used as carriers of quantum information.  \n \n \n  \nEngineering\nnce and \ntechnology, where phonons are used as carriers of quantum information.  \n \n \n  \nEngineering the interactions of quantum systems with phonons/vibrations is an important \ntask for a wide range of disciplines, including quantum information1–3, optoelectronics4, \nmetrology5, energy harvesting6, and sensing7,8. Coherent phonons can play an important \nrole as carriers of quantum information9,10, whereas thermal phonons can negatively \nimpact the coherence properties of many  quantum systems even at single -phonon levels, \nand eventually limit the coherence of quantum devices11,12. The most common approach  \nto address this issue is to operate at reduced temperatures, typically in the milli -Kelvin \nrange, to decrease the population of thermal phonons9,13,14. However, this approach \nrequires complex and expensive cryogenic systems and does not mitigate the effects of 2 \n \n local heating due to driving fields used to interact with the qua ntum system15,16. Most \nimportantly, this approach does not allow for precise control of the local interactions \nbetween phonons and quantum systems, including those required for  implementing \nquantum operations and measurements. It is thus important to develop alternative \napproaches to control thermal phonons and their interactions with quantum systems.  \nAn emerging approach relies on engineering the phononic local density of state s \n(LDOS) by fabricating micro/nanostructures. In particular, phononic crystals (PnCs)17 \nwith periodic modulations of elastic properties have been intensively studied since  they \ncan possess phononic bandgaps, a frequency range in which phonons cannot propagate. \nThis is analogous to photonic crystals that support photonic bandgaps for electromagnetic \nwaves18. To date, demonstrated PnCs typically operate at relatively low frequencies ( ≲10 \nGHz) and have mainly been used to realize phononic shields19 to reduce mechanical \nlosses, as well as optomechanical cavities20,21 and waveguides22,23. On the\n19 to reduce mechanical \nlosses, as well as optomechanical cavities20,21 and waveguides22,23. On the other hand, \nPnCs offer a great opportunity to tailor the interactions between thermal phonons and \nemerging qubits or quantum emitters, a nd could suppress decoherence processes induced \nby high frequency phonons11,12,24, thus enabling operation at elevated temperatures. \nHowever, tailoring PnCs to specific qubits is challenging since it requires nanofabrication \nstrategies for non -stand ard materials (in which qubits are hosted), which  maintain or \nideally improve qubits’ properties (e.g. coherence, optical stability). Furthermore, a high \ndegree of control over the frequencies of the targeted phonons is required, which poses \nadditional ch allenges in particular when those frequencies are high (50 -100GHz), thereby \nrelying on features in the 10 -100 nm range.  As a result, previous attempts at control of \nthe interaction between bulk/thermal phonons and a quantum system relied on tuning the \nenergy levels of the quantum system25,26 or lacked the capacity to tailor the LDOS27. \nHere, we demonstrate free -standing diamond PnCs with ~20nm features, which \nsupport a ~20 GHz -wide complete bandgap centered at ~60 GHz and use them to  mitigate \nthe phonon -induced relaxation of a single quantum system. Our quantum system is a \nnegatively charged silicon -vacancy (SiV) color center in diamond. The SiV is a leading \nquantum memory candidate for the development of quantum networks28,29 due to its \nexcellent optical properties and an optically accessible spin. However, the SiV also \nfeatures high sensitivity to  strain and mechanical vibrations26,30,31, and typically requires \noperation at milli -Kelvin temperatures to decouple it from the thermal bath13. Here, we \nuse single SiV centers as an optical probe of the phononic LDOS, and show evidence of \nthe high -frequency phononic bandgap. Our work draws inspiration from previous wor k \non controlling photonic LDOS using p\nononic bandgap. Our work draws inspiration from previous wor k \non controlling photonic LDOS using photonic crystals to inhibit spontaneous light \nemission from quantum emitters32,33. By suppressing spontaneous single -phonon \nprocesses in SiV centers using PnCs, we experimentally show that orbital relaxation rates \nwithin the pho nonic bandgap can be more than one order of magnitude lower than in bulk. \nThis large reduction in the relaxation rates using PnCs may allow operation of SiVs at \nelevated temperatures.  \n \n \n  3 \n \n Results  \nDesign and Fabrication of diamond PnCs  \n \n \n \nFig. 1 | PnCs in single -crystal diamond. a, Illustration of  free-standing PnCs supported \nwith tapered waveguides at both ends.

This simple PnC structure is known to support complete \nbandgaps34. The unit cell of the PnCs (inset of Fig. 1a) is composed of an elliptical block \nand small tethers with thickness d = 70 nm, and lattice constant a =130 nm. The major \n(w) and minor ( h) axes of the elliptical block are 96 nm and 90 nm, respectively. To obtain \na larger bandgap, we decrease the tether width ( t) as much as possible (see Supplementary \nFig. 3), leading to increased mass contrast between the elliptical block and the tether. We \nchoose devices with a very small t of ~20 nm for t he experiments with SiV centers.  \nFigure 1b shows the dispersion relation (frequency vs. wave vector) for the phonon \nmodes supported by the structure and obtained by simulating the unit cell with its \nexperimentally measured dimensions (see Supplementary Se ction 2) using finite element \nmethod (COMSOL multiphysics). The band diagram features a large complete phononic \nbandgap with a width of 17.3 GHz centered at 59.1 GHz. These values are 4 -10 times \ngreater than those reported previously19,20,35,36. Similar to photonic bandgaps, the \nphononic bandgap results in a complete depletion of the p hononic LDOS in this frequency \nrange, as can be seen in the right panel. The robustness of the bandgap against fabrication \nimperfections is discussed in Supplementary Section 3. The bandgap frequency is chosen \nto overlap with the orbital ground state split ting (Δ GS) of a typical low -strain SiV center \n(\u003E46GHz) and thus suppress the spontaneous single -phonon transitions, as detailed in the \nfollowing section  .   \nThe suspended PnCs are fabr\n single -phonon transitions, as detailed in the \nfollowing section  .   \nThe suspended PnCs are fabricated into a single -crystal diamond substrate using top -\ndown reactive i on etching followed by a quasi -isotropic etching step37,38(see Methods and \nSupplementary Section 1). The single SiV centers are deterministically incorporated into \nthe center of t he array of PnCs by a mask implantation technique39. The scanning electron \nmicroscope (SEM) images of fabricated PnCs are shown in Fig. 1c -f. The PnC structure \nhas a ~100 nm periodicity and features as small as ~20 nm (see Fig. 1f).  \n  5 \n \n  \nOrbital lifetime measurements for  SiV centers  \n \n  \nFig. 2 | Orbital lifetime measurements of single SiV centers. a,  Schematics of the \natomic structure of the SiV center in diamond. b, Energy level structure of the SiV center, \nshowing the frequency splitting between orbital branches in the  ground state (Δ GS).

Figure 2b displays the simplified electronic energy levels of a SiV center, \nwith one of the excited states and two ground states with a splitting of Δ GS (see \nSupp lementary Section 6 for the detailed energy level). This splitting originates from the \nspin-orbit coupling in  i  centers and typical Δ GS of unstrained SiV centers in bulk is \n~50 GHz40. The transitions of single -phonon emission and absorption between the two \nground states (green arrows) determine the lifetime of the orbital states ( T1,orbit), which \nalso mainly limi ts the electronic spin coherence time of SiV centers around 4K12. To \nmeasure T1,orbit for our single SiV centers, we perform time -resolved pump -probe \nmeasurements (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5) with laser pulses resonant with \none of the electronic transitions and probing population in state |1\u003E (blue arrow shown in \nFig. 2b) at 4.4K. Figure 2c shows the pulse sequence where we measure the initialization \nand read -out of the orbital state separated by a variable delay τ through time -resolved \nfluorescence resulting from optical pumping (upper panel). The lower panel shows an \nexample of a measured time -resolved spectrum for τ = 30 ns.

Figure 2d shows an \nexample of population recovery as a function of τ measured for a single SiV center in \nbulk. From the fit of the exponential recovery (see Supplementary Section 7), we extract \nT1,orbit in bulk to be 34 ± 1 ns, which is comparable  with that reported for bulk SiV centers \naround 4K40.      \n  7 \n \n  \nSiV orbital degrees of freedom as probes of phono nic LDOS   \n    \n \nFig. 3 | Ground state splitting dependence of SiV orbital lifetimes. a,  SEM images of \nsuspended diamond PnC (upper) and diamond nanobeam without PnC (lower) fabricated \non the same chip. b, Thermalization curves measured for a single SiV center in bulk, \nnanobeam and PnCs. The solid lines are fitting curves based on a single exponential \nfunction.

The gray shaded region corresponds to the calculated phononic \nbandgap shown in Fig . 1e. The gray solid (dashed) lines indicate the uncertainty of the \nposition and s ize of the bandgap induced by the standard deviation of -3nm (+3nm) from \nthe measured tether width t=22nm.   \n \nNext, we compare the T1,orbit measured in PnCs to that in bulk as well as suspended \ndiamond nanobeams with the same width and thickness as PnCs (Fig. 3a) and fabricated \non the same chip. In this experiment, we use low -strain  i  centers with Δ GS ~ 60 GHz \ncorresponding to our PnC bandgap. Using photoluminescence -based measurements (see \nMethods and Supplementary Section 8), we confirm that there is no significant spectral \ndiffusion or linewidth broadening of SiV centers in PnCs. Figure 3b shows the \nthermalization curves measured for  i  centers of similar Δ GS within the bandg\nFigure 3b shows the \nthermalization curves measured for  i  centers of similar Δ GS within the bandgap in a \nPnC (red), in a nanobeam ( blue), and in bulk ( green ). We can clearly  see that the \npopulation recovery observed for the SiV in PnCs is much slower than in bulk and in a \nnanobeam. The longest T1,orbit among the measured SiV centers within the bandgap is 486 \n± 12 ns, which is approximately 18 (15) times longer than the averag e lifetime for 5 \ndifferent SiV centers measured in bulk (nanobeam). This is clear evidence of the decrease \nof the phononic LDOS at ~ 60 GHz by the bandgap effect. On the other hand, as seen in \nFig. 3b, we do not observe significant change in T1,orbit for the SiV centers in nanobeams \nrelative to bulk despite the modified LDOS induced by their lower dimensionality41. This \nsuggests that a complete bandgap is necessary to sufficiently suppress thermal  phonons \n8 \n \n and the resulting phonon -induced relaxation.  \nWe then use  i  centers with different Δ GS to probe the extent of the phononic bandgap. \nFigure 3c shows the summary of T1,orbit, overlaid with the same calculated phononic  \nbandgap as the one shown in Fig . 1b, including the fabrication uncertainty of PnC \nparameters (see Supplementary Section 3). Overall, the values of T1,orbit for SiV centers \nwith Δ GS within the bandgap tend to be much higher than those in bulk and nanobeams , \nfurther confirming that the phonon -induced transitions between ground state orbitals are \nlargely suppressed by the bandgap effect. The fluctuation of T1,orbit within the bandgap, \nparticularly the lower T1,orbit values could be due to the variations in ba ndgap size and/or \nposition caused by fabrication imperfection (see Supplementary Section 3) or the \ndegradation of the emitters located near etched sidewalls42. We also measured T1,orbit on \n i  centers with Δ GS outside the bandgap (\u003E 70GHz). As expected, T1,orbit outside the \nbandgap show similar values to those measured in bulk and nan\nz). As expected, T1,orbit outside the \nbandgap show similar values to those measured in bulk and nanobeams, confirming the \nrealization of the large phononic bandgap of approximately 20 GHz around 60 GHz.  \n \n \nTemperature -dependent measurements of orbital lifetimes  \n \n \n \nFig. 4 | Temper ature dependence of orbital relaxation rates of single SiV centers.  a, \nPopulation recovery measured for a single SiV center in the PnC bandgap at  6 different \ntemperatures. The solid lines are fitting curves based on a single exponential function to \nextrac t T1,orbit. b, Temperature dependence of the measured orbital relaxation rate \n(Γ=1/T1,orbit) for single SiV centers in bulk (black), nanobeam (green), and PnCs (red). In \neach case, the SiV center with the longest T1,orbit is used for temperature -dependent \nmeasurements. The error bars are standard deviations extracted from the single \nexponential fitting. The data for the bulk and the nanobeam can be fitted with a linear \nregression of T . For the SiV center in PnC, the dashed pink line is a linear fitting to the \nexperimental data below 1 3K. The red solid curve is a fitting with a polynomial function \nwith T 3. The dashed gray line indicates the average value of bulk SiV centers measured \nat 4.4K.  \n \n \n  \n   \n               9 \n \n We finally  investigate the temperature dependence of the popu lation recovery by \nmeasuring T1,orbit from 4.4 K to 20 K. We use the same single SiV centers in bulk, \nnanobeam, and PnC as those shown in Fig. 3b. Figure 4a shows examples of the \nthermalization curves measured for the SiV center in the PnC bandgap at 6 dif ferent \ntemperatures. As expected, the population recovery becomes faster with increasing \nsample temperature due to the higher thermal population of the residual phononic LDOS. \nThe temperature dependence of the orbital relaxation rates ( Γ=1/T1,orbit) measur ed for SiV \ncenters in bulk, nanobeam and PnC are plotted in Fig. 4b. The Γ measured in bulk tends \nto increase linea\nrs in bulk, nanobeam and PnC are plotted in Fig. 4b. The Γ measured in bulk tends \nto increase linearly with temperature since single -phonon processes between the ground \nstate levels are dominant below 20K, which is consistent with previousl y reported \nobservations for bulk SiV centers12,40. We also clearly observe a linear temperature \ndependence of Γ for the SiV center in a nanobeam, while showing a slightly slower speed \nof increase  (0.47±0.02 MHz/K)  compared to bulk (0.68 ± 0.04 MHz/K). The evolution of \nΓ for the SiV center in a PnC below 1 3 K can also be approximated as a linear relationship \nwith temperature, though it shows a much smaller slope of 0.15 ± 0.004 MHz/K. The \nclear difference in the rate of increase in Γ between PnCs and bulk (nanobeam) ori ginates \nfrom the differences in the phononic LDOS (see Supplementary Fig. S4), showing that \nmodifying the LDOS is advantageous for suppressing the increase in Γ at elevated \ntemperatures. At temperatures above 12 K, Γ for PnCs starts to show a clear deviati on \nfrom the linear trend. Above this temperature, the experimental data can be well fitted \nwith a function proportional to T 3 (red solid curve) as shown in Fig. 4b. This result \nindicates that higher -order phonon processes such as inelastic Raman processes40 with \nfrequencies outside the bandgap become dominant above 12K (see detailed discussion in \nSupplementary Sec tion 9) as a result of the large suppression of the single -phonon \nprocesses by the PnC bandgap. These results show the successful demonstration of \nsuppression of the spontaneous single -phonon transitions with high frequencies around \n60 GHz by the PnC bandg ap effect. Importantly, the measured T1,orbit for PnCs at 20K is \n~ 30 ns, which is comparable to the average T1,orbit of bulk SiV centers (~ 27 ns) measured \nat 4.4K (a dashed gray line in Fig. 4b). This indicates that the PnCs with a complete \nbandgap can b e useful to increase the operating temperature of SiV centers.  \n \nCs with a complete \nbandgap can b e useful to increase the operating temperature of SiV centers.  \n \nDiscussion  \nIn summary, we have demonstrated the suppression of high -frequency thermal phonons \nusing PnCs and the mitigation of their detrimental effect on a target single quantum \nemitter in d iamond. We fabricated free -standing diamond PnCs with sub -100 nm scale \nfeatures to support a ~20 GHz -wide complete phononic bandgap centered at ~ 60 GHz. \nUsing the PnCs, we showed that orbital relaxation rates of single SiV centers in diamond \ncan be reduce d by more than one order of magnitude compared to bulk and free -standing \nnanobeams. This large reduction in the relaxation rates due to inhibition of the single -\nphonon processes in the SiV center enables significant suppression of phonon -emitter \ninteractio ns up to 20K. These results open the possibility to not only efficiently control \nspecific high -frequency phonons of interest for applications in radio -frequency signal \nprocessing43, optomechanic s44, and thermoe lectrics45, but also to improve optical and/or \nspin properties of solid -state quantum systems at higher temperatures,  such as the spin \ncoherence time of the SiV at 4K. Our approach to suppress the high -frequency thermal \nphonons and related phonon -induced relaxation could also be applied to any other solid -10 \n \n state quantum systems that interact with thermal phonons24,46. Finally, since our PnC \nstructures are compatible with existing planar photonic and phononic integrated \nplatforms47, they could be a fundamental building block to realize phonon -mediated \ndevices with solid -state quantum emitters and qubits for scal able quantum networks48. \n \n \nReferences  \n1.

It is then \ncleaned using a 1:1:1 boiling tri -acid mixture of perchloric, nitric, and sulfuric acid. \nSilicon ions (Si+) are implanted with an energy of 50 keV. The resulting mean ion ran ge \nis ~35nm from the surface with a straggling of 8nm, as simulated by the software package \n“ topping and Range of Ions in Matter” ( RIM). The  i  centers are then generated by \na high -temperature (1100°C), high -vacuum annealing procedure followed by the sa me \nboiling tri -acid cleaning described above. The phononic crystals (PnCs) are patterned into \nthe bulk diamond containing SiV centers by electron beam lithography, and dry etching. \nTo realize free -standing PnCs, we use quasi -isotropic etching technique for  undercutting \nthe PhC slab. Det\n free -standing PnCs, we use quasi -isotropic etching technique for  undercutting \nthe PhC slab. Details of the fabrication steps can be found in Supplementary Section 1.      \n \nPhotoluminescence measurements  \nThe diamond sample is mounted on a closed -cycle liquid helium cryostat (attoDRY800) \nand cooled down to 4.4 K. A conti nuous -wave (CW) 520 nm laser diode (Thorlabs \nLP520 -SF15) is used to pump the sample off -resonantly. The zero -phonon -line (ZPL) \nemission from single SiV centers in the sample is collected by an objective lens (0.9 NA \n×100) and sent to a spectrometer equippe d with a Si CCD camera to spectrally resolve \nthe ZPLs. For photoluminescence excitation (PLE) measurements, we use a tunable CW \nTi:sapphire laser (M -Squared Sols Tis) for the resonant excitation to the SiV ZPLs. The \nPLE emission is collected from the phonon -sideband above 750 nm and is sent to an \navalanche photodiode (APD) (Excelitas) to measure the photon counts. The frequency of \nthe tunable laser is stabilized by continuous feedback with a wavemeter (High Finesse \nWS7). The CW 520nm laser is periodically pu lsed by a digital delay generator (SRS \nDG645) to repump the SiV centers into the negatively charged state. A schematic \nillustration of the optical measurement setup can be found in Supplementary Section 5.  \n \nOrbital lifetime measurements  \nWe implement the tw o-pulse sequence to measure the orbital lifetime by pulsing our \ntunable CW Ti :sapphire laser with an acousto -optic modulator (AOM) (AA opto -\nelectronic). The AOM is driven by an arbitrary waveform generator (Tektronix \nAWG70001A) through an RF switch (Mini -Circuits ZASWA2 -50DR -FA+) with a \nvoltage -controlled oscillator (Mini -Circuits ZX95 -209-S+). The laser frequency is \nstabilized by continuous feedback from a wavemeter (High Finesse WS7). A pulsed 520 \nnm laser is also used to keep the negatively charged state  of SiV centers. A time -\ncorrelated single -photon counting system (PicoHarp 300) with a\nrged state  of SiV centers. A time -\ncorrelated single -photon counting system (PicoHarp 300) with a superconducting \nnanowire single photon detector or APD is used to detect the photon counts from phonon -\nsideband emission of SiV centers. For temperature dependent measur ements, the sample \ntemperature is tuned using a local heater attached to the sample holder and it is then \nstabilized by continuous feedback with a proportional -integral -differential controller.  \n 14 \n \n Acknowledgments  \nThe authors would like to thank Prof. S.

Phononic crystal fabrication  \nBefore spin -coating of a 400nm -thick electron beam (EB) resist (ZEP520A), a 100 nm -\nthick SiN layer is deposited on the bulk diamond by plasma -enhanced chemical vapor \ndeposition [Fig. S1a]. The SiN lay er is used as a hard mask for etching the diamond later. \nThe phononic crystal (PnC) pattern is written by EB lithography on the EB resist [Fig. \nS1b]. After the resist development [Fig. S 1c], the SiN mask layer is etched by induced \ncoupled plasma -reactive i on etching (ICP -RIE) with sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) and \noctafluorocyclobutane (C 4F8) gasses [Fig. S1d]. After removing the EB resist [Fig. S1e], \nwe transfer the PnC pattern onto the diamond substrate by oxygen plasma RIE [Fig. S1f]. \nAn Al 2O3 layer with a thickness of 20nm is deposited by atomic layer deposition  (ALD)  \nfor conformal coverage of the sample [Fig. S1g] and then etched out by following RIE \nwith Ar and Cl gasses [Fig. S1h], while keeping the sidewalls of the PnCs covered with \nAl2O3. To realize free -standing structures, we employ a quasi -isotropic undercut \ntechnique1 using an oxygen -based RIE [Fig. S1i]. The Al 2O3 and SiN layers are finally \nremoved using hydrofluoric acid (HF) [Fig. S1j].  \n \n \n \nFig. S1  | Process flow for the phononic cr ystal fabrication.  a, A 100 nm -thick SiN is \ndeposited on a diamond substrate by PECVD before spin coating of EB resist (ZEP520A). \nb, Phononic crystals are patterned into the resist by EB lithograph y. c, The EB r esist is \ndevelop\nb, Phononic crystals are patterned into the resist by EB lithograph y. c, The EB r esist is \ndevelop ed. d, The SiN hard mask is e tched by ICP -RIE using the resist mask. e, The EB \nresist is remov ed. f, The pattern of the PnC is transferred into the diamond by oxygen \nplasma etching using the SiN mask. g, The Al 2O3 layer is deposited on diamond by ALD. \nh, Top-down RIE  using argon/chlorine gases  is used to form the Al 2O3 layer only on the \nsidewall of the dia mond slab . i, Quasi -isotropic etching is performed based on oxygen \nplasma etching. j, The diamond sample is dipped into HF to remove Al 2O3 and SiN.      \n \n \n                           \n   \n    \n     3 \n \n 2. Extraction of geometric parameters of fabricated PnCs  \nWe fitted the PnCs in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to extract all \ngeometric parameters: major and minor axes of the ellipse block ( w and h), tether width \n(t), radius of a circle at the rou nded corner ( r), and lattice constant ( a), and thickness ( d). \nAs shown in the inset of Fig. S2, we fitted blocks (tethers) of the 73 unit cells with an \nellipse (hyperbolic) function for w and h (t). 253 rounded corners of the 73 unit cells are \nfitted using circles for extracting r. We also extract a from the dista nce between the \ncenters of the fitted ellipses (53 samples). Figure S2 shows the histogram of the extracted \nh as an example. The PhC thickness d is also measured from 15 PnC devices in angled -\nview SEM images.

Influence of fabrication imperfection on the phononic bandgap  \nGiven the measured parameters from SEM shown in Table S1, we calculated the size and \ncenter position of the phononic bandgap by finite element method (FEM) simulations. \nThe details of the calculation of band structure for diamond PnCs can be found in our \nprevious work2. Figures S3 a~f show the summary of the simulations for each parameter. \nThe gray shaded are a shows the range of the standard deviation. For the bandgap position, \nfluctuations in the tether width ( t) and lattice constant ( a) have the biggest influence, while \nthe resulting changes of the position are very small (\u003C 2%). For the bandgap size, \nvariat ions in t largely change the size by 18%. This is because the mass contrast between \nthe elliptical block and tether is sensitive to the bandgap size (see Fig.S3c). We concluded \nthat variations in the t have the largest impact on the bandgap among measured parameters. \nFrom these results, we plotted the bandgap considering the measured variations in t, in \nFig. 3c in the main text.  \n \n \nFig. S3  | Simulated bandgap size and center position for PnCs  with measured \nvariations.  a, w. b, h. c, t. d, r. e, a. and f, d.

Calculation of phononic band structure and density of states for the nanobeam  \nWe simulated the band diagram of the fabricated suspended nanobeam (beam width = 90 \nnm and thickness = 70nm), shown in Fig. 3 a in the main text. Figure S4 a shows the \ncalculated band diagram of the nanobeam (orange solid line), overlaid with that of PnCs \nshown in Fig. 1 b in the main text.

Based on the si mulated dispersion relations, we also \ncalculated the corresponding phononic density of states (DOS)3 for the nanobeam and \nPnCs, as shown in Fig. S4 b. As can be seen in Fig. S4 c, the DOS of the PnCs is completely \ndepleted in the bandgap region centered at ~  60GHz (gray shaded area in Fig. S4 a), while \nthat of the nanobeam has remained because there are two phononic modes over the \nbandgap region. This difference of the DOS results in the difference of T1orbit and its \ntemperature dependence, as shown in Fig 3 a nd Fig 4 in the main text.  \n \n5 \n \n  \nFig. S4  | Band structure and DOS for the nanobeam and PnCs.  a, Simulated band \ndiagram for the nanobeam (orange solid curve), overlaid with that of PnCs shown in Fig. \n1b in the main text.

Details of energy level structure of the SiV system  \nThe detai led level structure of the SiV center under zero magnetic field is shown in Fig. \nS6a. The optical ground and excited state contain two orbital branches (black horizontal \nlines) with splittings of ΔES and ΔGS, respectively (blue arrows), which originates fr om \nthe lifted degeneracy of the orbitals in each state by spin -orbit coupling. The orbital \ntransitions in ground and excited state can be driven by the phonons with frequencies \ncorresponding to the splittings (solid and dashed green arrows). This energy le vel \nconfiguration also provides four optical transitions in zero -phonon \nn arrows). This energy le vel \nconfiguration also provides four optical transitions in zero -phonon lines(ZPL) labeled as \nA, B, C, and D (red arrows) shows in Fig. S6a. Figure S6b shows an example of \nphotoluminescence(PL) spectrum of a single SiV center measured in a PnCs by off -\nresonant excitation with a 520nm CW diode laser. For the extraction of Δ GS, we measure \nthe distance between C and D lines observed in a PL or photoluminescence excitation \n(PLE) spectrum.  \nIn order to confirm the single photon nature of our SiV centers, we perf orm second -\norder correlation measurements for a SiV center in one of the PnCs using a Hanbury \nBrown -Twiss setup equipped with two avalanche photodiodes (APDs). We resonantly \nexcite its transition C by the tunable CW laser and collect the phonon -sideband \nfluorescence. Figure S7 shows the intensity correlation histogram measured at 4.3K. We \nfitted the data with a model4 after convoluting it with a time resolution of our system \n(~550ps). The second -order correlation function at zero delay time, g2(0), exhibits  a clear \nantibunching with a value of 0.1, confirming that the SiV center is a single photon emitter.  \n \n \nFig. S6  | Energy level structure of the SiV. a , Schematics of electronic level structure \nof the SiV center with 4 zero -phonon transitions (labeled as A, B, C and D) under zero \nmagnetic field.

Figure S 8b shows an example of a time -resolved fluorescence \nspectrum measured with a time delay τ = 30 ns between two laser pulses. The blue area \nunder the leading edge of the first (pump) pulse corresponds to the thermal population \nPpeak1 in one of the ground stat e levels (|2\u003E). The population then decays to a stationary \nstate, whose population Pst1 (light gray area) is determined by a competition between the \noptical pumping rate and orbital relaxation rates between ground states ( γup and γdown). \nThe blue area unde r the leading edge of the second (probe) pulse after a time interval of \nτ corresponds to partially recovered population Ppeak2(τ) to the other ground state |1\u003E due \n-20 0 200.00.51.01.5g2(t)\nDelay time (ns)\n8 \n \n to thermalization processes.

Saturation response and stability of a SiV ZPL transition in PnCs  \nWe investigate the saturation response of a SiV ZPL transition in phononic crystals \n(PnCs).

We scan the C transition of the SiV usin g a \ncontinuous wave (CW) laser to mea\n c in the main text. We scan the C transition of the SiV usin g a \ncontinuous wave (CW) laser to measure its PLE spectrum (inset of Fig. S 9a). A pulsed \n520 nm laser is also used to periodically repump the SiV into the negatively charged state. \nFigure S 9a shows a summary of the integrated counts of measured PLE spectra  as a \nfunction of the laser power. The SiV transition saturates around 1 μW.  \nWe then check the stability of the same SiV embedded in PnCs by measuring its C \ntransition over a ~2.5 hours period using the same CW laser. The laser power is set to be \n0.3 μW, w hich is below the saturation power shown in Fig. S 9a. The color map of PLE \nspectra is shown in Fig S 9b.

Model of electron -phonon interactions  \nFor describing the temperature dependence of orbital relaxation rates shown i n Fig. 4 b in \nthe main text, we first consider the first -order electron -phonon transitions between orbital \nstates in SiV centers, involving spontaneous absorption or emission of a single -phonon \nwith the resonance to the frequency of the ground state splitti ng, as shown in Fig. S 10a. \nThe rates of upward 𝛾+ (absorption) and downward 𝛾− (emission) phonon transitions are \ngiven by6 \n \n𝛾+=2𝜋𝜒𝜌 𝛥3𝑛(𝛥,𝑇)                      \nd downward 𝛾− (emission) phonon transitions are \ngiven by6 \n \n𝛾+=2𝜋𝜒𝜌 𝛥3𝑛(𝛥,𝑇)                          (S2) \n𝛾−=2𝜋𝜒𝜌 𝛥3[𝑛(𝛥,𝑇)+1]                 (S3) \n \nwhere,  χ is a coupling constant that encapsulates averaged interaction over all phonon \nmodes and polarizations, while 𝜌 is the phonon density of states. 𝑛 indicates the \noccupation of phonon modes following the Bose -Einstein distribution. In the temperature \nT \u003E h𝛥GS/kB, the equations above (S2 and S3) can be approximated as follows:  \n \n𝛾+≈𝛾−≈2𝜋\nℏ𝜒𝜌𝛥2𝑘𝐵𝑇                    (S4) \n \nHence, the orbital relaxation rates are linearly proportional to temperatures 𝑇. Based on \nthis model, we used a simple linear regression (= A + B T, where A and B are constant) to \nfit experimentally measured relaxation rates in bulk, nanobeam and PhC shown  in Fig. \n4b in the main text. The summary of fitting results is shown in Table S2.  \n \n \n \nFig. S10  | Various phonon transitions between orbital states in SiV centers.  a, Single -\nphonon direct transition.

This observation is well described by the \nscaling of T 3, stemming from two -phonon\ng SiV centers6. This observation is well described by the \nscaling of T 3, stemming from two -phonon process via elastic Raman process (Fig. S 10b), \nwhich is more dominant than inelastic Raman process (Fig. S 10c) in SiV centers.  The \norbital relaxation rate for elastic Raman process is expressed as follows6:    \n \n𝛾𝑑−≈𝛾𝑑+≈2𝜋ℏ2𝜒2𝜌2𝛥2∫𝑛(𝜔,𝑇)(𝑛(𝜔,𝑇)+1)𝜔2𝑑𝜔∞\n0 \n =2𝜋3\n3ℏ𝜒2𝜌2𝛥2𝑘𝐵3𝑇3                    (S5) \n \nwhere 𝜔 is frequency. The final form of the equation (S5) shows the orbital relaxation \nrates scales as T 3. We fitted the measured rates with a function of T 3 (=A+B T 3, where \nA and B are constant), and obtained A and B to be 0.52 ± 0.06 MHz and 6.3×10-4±1.8 \n×10-5 MHz K-1, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. S1 1, the experimental data can be \nwell described by the model with the scaling of T 3 dependence. On the other hand, other \npotential models7,8 involving a two phonon Raman process with the scaling of T 5 or T 7  \nincrease the fit error and cannot explain the experimental data well.   \n \nFig. S11  | Measured orbital relaxation rates of a SiV center in PnCs as a function of \nsample temperatures.

In near-term networks, herald-\ning is required to inform endpoints of successfully generated\nentanglement. If after heralding, entanglement fidelity is too\nlow, entanglement purification can be utilized to probabilistically\nincrease fidelity. Traditionally, purification protocols proceed\nas follows: generate heralded EPR pairs, execute a series of\nquantum operations on two or more pairs between two nodes,\nand classically communicate results to check for success. Purifi-\ncation may require several rounds while qubits are stored in\nmemories, vulnerable to decoherence. In this work, we explore\nthe notion of optimistic purification in a single link setup,\nwherein classical communication required for heralding and\npurification is delayed, possibly to the end of the process.\nOptimism reduces the overall time EPR pairs are stored in\nmemory. While this is beneficial for fidelity, it can result in lower\nrates due to the continued execution of protocols with sparser\nheralding and purification outcome updates. We apply optimism\nto the entanglement pumping scheme, ground- and satellite-based\nEPR generation sources, and current state-of-the-art purification\ncircuits. We evaluate sensitivity performance to a number of\nparameters including link length, EPR source rate and fidelity,\nand memory coherence time. We observe that our optimistic\nprotocols are able to increase fidelity, while the traditional\napproach becomes detrimental to it for long distances. We\no increase fidelity, while the traditional\napproach becomes detrimental to it for long distances. We study\nthe trade-off between rate and fidelity under entanglement-based\nQKD, and find that optimistic schemes can yield higher rates\ncompared to non-optimistic counterparts, with most advantages\nseen in scenarios with low initial fidelity and short coherence\ntimes.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nCertain features of quantum mechanics, such as superpo-\nsition, entanglement, and interference, have the potential to\nequip us with applications that are not achievable in the\nclassical world. Examples of quantum-enabled advantages\ninclude exponential and polynomial algorithmic speedups [1]\nand provably secure communication [2]. Besides being able to\nprovide the latter, quantum networks [3] can also support dis-\ntributed quantum computation [4], clock synchronization [5],\nand quantum sensing [6]. An essential requirement for dis-\ntributed quantum applications is entanglement of sufficiently\nhigh quality shared between nodes. Consequently, one of the\nmain goals of a quantum network is to reliably distribute this\nresource across a potentially large distance.\nA maximally entangled bipartite state (also known as an\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) [7] or Bell pair) is a pair of\nSuccessful purification\nFig. 1. Purification example. Two nodes, with three quantum memories\neach, begin with three imperfect entangled states (red curves, dashed). After\npurification is carried out (successfully in the example), the nodes are left\nwith a higher-quality single entangled state (red curve, solid).\nqubits that are entangled such that if we measure the quantum\nstate of one, then we know the exact state of the other. One\ncan use photons to generate and distribute EPR pairs but due\nto exponential photon loss in optical fiber, the generation of\nan EPR pair over a long distance poses a significant challenge.\nFurther, due to the No-Cloning Theorem [8], one cannot\ncopy or amplify quantum information at intermediate s\n due to the No-Cloning Theorem [8], one cannot\ncopy or amplify quantum information at intermediate stations.\nA solution is to use quantum repeaters [9, 10] that assist\nwith long-distance entanglement generation via entanglement\nswapping [11, 12].\nImperfect memories, decoherence, and gate noise preclude\nthe distribution of perfect entanglement within a quantum\nnetwork. In reality, what nodes receive are low quality EPR\npairs. Entanglement quality is crucial for distributed quantum\napplications, e.g., quantum key distribution (QKD) [2, 13],\nBlind Quantum Computation (BQC) [14], as it can determine\nnot only performance measures specific to such an application,\nbut also the feasibility of carrying it out at all. It is therefore\nnecessary to take heed of and increase this quality when pos-\nsible. One measure of entanglement quality is fidelity , which\nquantifies the closeness of a given quantum state to some\ndesired state. In quantum networks, a commonly sought-after\ngoal is the distribution of high-fidelity entanglement, where\nfidelity is computed in reference to one of the four Bell pairs.\nOne way to increase fidelity is through purification [15], which\ninvolves the application of local gates and measurements on\nboth ends of a shared entangled state, followed by classical\ninformation exchange to communicate success or failure of\nthis probabilistic process. Figure 1 illustrates the method at a\nhigh level.\nHeralded entanglement purification (HEP) is a necessary\nmechanism for first-generation quantum networks [16], and\nyet, practical execution workflows for such protocols still\n1arXiv:2401.08034v1  [quant-ph]  16 Jan 2024Fig. 2. The setup is comprised of an entanglement source situated between\ntwo quantum network nodes. The nodes, capable of performing purification,\nare equipped with quantum memories that can store entangled states.\nrequire more study. Our work investigates the advantages\nand limitations of purification for two nodes connected by a\nsingle quantum link – a\n the advantages\nand limitations of purification for two nodes connected by a\nsingle quantum link – a building block for quantum networks\n– as a means of improving our understanding of how such\nworkflows could be designed and realized on a fully fledged\nnetwork. Figure 2 illustrates the setting we consider: two\nnodes are connected via a classical channel used for heralding\nentanglement and exchanging purification results. Equidistant\nfrom both nodes is an entanglement generation source that\ndistributes sub-unit fidelity entanglement. Nodes are equipped\nwith imperfect quantum memories and noisy quantum gates.\nPurification can be performed by two nodes that share at\nleast two heralded entangled pairs: one, which we denote as\nthemain pair, is kept, while others, often called sacrificial\npairs, are eventually measured1[10, 15, 17, 18]. The traditional\nway of carrying out purification involves each node performing\nlocal operations on its qubits and measuring all sacrificial\npairs. Then, based on measurement results, which are ex-\nchanged over a classical channel, purification is deemed either\nsuccessful or unsuccessful. Upon success, the parties may\nperform further purification on the purified entangled state(s),\nor allow an application to consume the entanglement. In case\nof failure, the nodes are forced to discard the main pair and\nbegin the entire process anew. In this paper, we refer to the\ntraditional method as the baseline protocol (BASE) .\nClassical communication – a required part of purification,\nis a potentially significant cause of fidelity degradation – the\nmain entangled pairs must remain in noisy storage while\nawaiting confirmation. If a purification scheme has several\nrounds ( e.g., the pumping scheme [10]), or each purification\ncircuit includes several measurements, then all results must be\nchecked [19], and this further increases the storage time of a\npair. Checking purification results costs time at least equal to\nthe data propagation delay on a link. Thi\nChecking purification results costs time at least equal to\nthe data propagation delay on a link. This makes traditional\npurification impractical for longer distances when the nodes\ninvolved are equipped with noisy quantum memories.\nA characteristic property of the purification schemes that\nwe study is the reduced wait time of stored entanglement via\ncurtailment of overall classical communication. This reduced\nstorage time in turn impacts the fidelity of entangled pairs\nby the time they are ready to be consumed by an appli-\ncation. An example of such a scheme is one that foregoes\n1More generally, n→kpurification, with n \u003E k initial and kresulting\nstates, is also possible.a number of classical communication rounds, continuing on\nto further purification steps without checking for purification\nsuccess/failure. This idea was introduced by Hartmann et al.\nin [20]. The authors applied their idea to heralded EPR pairs\nin the pumping scheme [21], and showed that nodes can\nbe optimistic with respect to purification results, checking\npurification outcomes only at the end. In this work, we refer\nto their scheme as the heralded-optimistic protocol (HOPT) .\nIn this work, we further increase optimism, by applying it\nnot only to purification results but also to heralding signals.\nIntuitively, our optimistic protocol (OPT) can yield even higher\nfidelities since entanglement spends even less time in quantum\nmemory. Similar to the work in [21], we apply our optimistic\napproach to the pumping scheme, in ground- and satellite-\nbased setups [22], and show that for large distances and short\nmemory coherence times, our approach increases fidelity while\nHOPT and BASE can harm fidelity. Nevertheless, a heightened\ndegree of optimism can decrease the overall rate, since more\nentanglement will be spent on failed purification procedures.\nThus, a trade-off exists between rate and fidelity. We study\nthis rate-fidelity trade-off with the secret key rate (SKR) of the\nBB84 protocol [2, 13]. We evalua\n\nthis rate-fidelity trade-off with the secret key rate (SKR) of the\nBB84 protocol [2, 13]. We evaluate the SKR on the pumping\nscheme [10], for a range of hardware parameters including\nthe link’s entanglement generation rate, the initial fidelity\nof generated entanglement, and quantum memory coherence\ntime. We also study the effect of distance between nodes on\nthe secret key rate. We also evaluate a current state-of-the-\nart purification circuit [19] that includes multiple purification\ncheckpoints. We observe that in harsh environments – lower\ninitial (pre-purification) fidelity and short coherence time –\noptimistic schemes are advantageous for the SKR. In scenarios\nwith higher coherence times, one may switch to the baseline\nor the heralded-optimistic protocol, and in the case of high\ninitial fidelity, purification may not be necessary at all.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in\nSection II we discuss related work in purification schemes. In\nSection III we provide the necessary background in quantum\nnetworking. In Section IV, we explain our optimistic approach\nand methodology. In Section V, we evaluate our optimistic ap-\nproach on a number of different purification schemes. Finally,\nin Section VI, we conclude our work and discuss challenges\nand future directions.\nII. R ELATED WORK\nEntanglement purification was introduced by Bennett et al.\nin [15]. They developed a circuit to improve the fidelity of one\nWerner state [23] (see Section III for a definition of this state)\nby sacrificing another state of the same form. In this work,\nthe authors did not evaluate purification performance in terms\nof rate and fidelity in quantum networks. Further, the effects\nof memory coherence and entanglement storage time on state\nfidelity and secret key rate were not considered. Deutsch et\nal.[17] improved previous work by proposing a protocol –\noften referred to as DEJMPS – which converges faster and\nrequires fewer resources. The scheme does not restrict the\ninitial \nMPS – which converges faster and\nrequires fewer resources. The scheme does not restrict the\ninitial states to be Werner – in this relaxation, a state can be\n2any linear combination of Bell basis states. In [17], there is no\nevaluation of the effect of memory noise on final fidelity. Dür\net al. [10] proposed the pumping scheme (see Section IV) and\nthe application of purification in quantum repeaters [10, 24];\nhowever, they did not consider quantum memory storage noise\nin their analysis.\nHartmann et al. studied the effect of memory noise on\nquantum repeaters with purification in [20]. Their noise model\naccounts for noisy two-qubit gates and dephasing in quantum\nmemories. They proposed nodes perform DEJMPS purification\nand entanglement swapping without checking results or apply-\ning corrections until the very end in a quantum network – a\nmanner of operation they dubbed blind mode . In this work, we\nshow that this methodology can exacerbate state fidelity when\ndistances are large and memory coherence times are short. In\n[21], the authors analyzed the scalability of blind repeaters,\nwhile still heralding EPR pair generation. In our work, we\nshow that we can also be optimistic about heralding signals,\nthereby improving performance in terms of fidelity and SKR.\nAll the aforementioned papers apply sub-optimal purifica-\ntion circuits. Nickerson et. al introduced the STRINGENT\nprotocol, which outperforms previous protocols in terms of\nfidelity improvement and quantum state consumption [25].\nThe effects of waiting times (arising from delays due to\nclassical communication of heralding and purification results)\non quantum states were not evaluated, however. Krastanov et.\nalapplied a genetic algorithm to optimize purification circuits\nwith respect to resource consumption and output fidelity [19].\nThe algorithm takes the initial state fidelity and the maximum\nallowed number of operations as input parameters. In their\nwork, circuit performance evaluation did not consider the\neffect\ntions as input parameters. In their\nwork, circuit performance evaluation did not consider the\neffect of classical communication-induced waiting time and\nstorage noise on output fidelity and rate. As the results in [19]\nare the current state-of-the-art in purification, we apply our\noptimistic scheme to these circuits and evaluate output fidelity\nand overall rate, while also incorporating storage noise and\nclassical communication time overhead.\nIII. Q UANTUM NETWORKING BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we provide necessary quantum background\nfor this paper. We begin by introducing EPR pairs, fidelity,\nquantum channels, the secret key fraction of BB84, quantum\nrepeaters, and purification in more detail. We also explain\nthe entanglement generation setup that we use throughout this\nwork.\nA. EPR Pairs\nEPR pairs (also known as Bell states [26]) are the following\ntwo-qubit quantum states: |ϕ±⟩= (|00⟩ ± | 11⟩)/√\n2and\n|ψ±⟩= (|01⟩ ± | 10⟩)/√\n2. A common objective for nodes\nin a quantum network is to be in possession of one qubit of a\nBell state, e.g.,|ϕ+⟩= (|00⟩+|11⟩)/√\n2, with the other qubit\nbelonging to another node with whom an application is jointly\nbeing carried out.B. Fidelity and Noise Model\nFidelity is a quantity that measures the closeness of two\nquantum states. Given a density matrix ρof a non-maximally\nentangled bipartite state, the fidelity F∈[0,1]with reference\nto|ϕ+⟩is given by2\nF(ρ) =\nϕ+\f\fρ\f\fϕ+\u000B\n, (1)\nclearly, higher values are desirable.\nIn the real world, quantum gates and quantum memories\nare imperfect and may inadvertently apply noise to qubits,\ndecreasing their fidelities. In this work, we consider the effect\nof noisy two-qubit gates on qubits, where noise is modeled\nby a depolarization channel for quantum gates. Namely, upon\napplication of a two-qubit quantum gate Uon the density\nmatrix ρof an n-qubit system, the transformation is success-\nful with probability pg, and the two qubits undergoing the\ntransformation are depolarized with probability 1−pg:\nρ′=pgUρU†+\n, and the two qubits undergoing the\ntransformation are depolarized with probability 1−pg:\nρ′=pgUρU†+ (1−pg)Tri,j(ρ)⊗I\n4, (2)\nwhere ρ′is the resulting density matrix, Tri,jis a partial\ntrace over qubits iandjthat are affected by U, and Iis\nthe identity matrix. In this work, we assume that controlled\ngates ( e.g., CNOT and CZ) depolarize both control and target\nqubits, while single-qubit gates are assumed to be ideal.\nSimilar to quantum gates, measuring a qubit introduces\nerrors in the output state. Measurement can project an arbitrary\nstate to the correct state with probability pmor to the wrong\nstate with probability 1−pm. An example is an imperfect\nprojection onto the |0⟩state:\nρ′=pm|0⟩⟨0|ρ|0⟩⟨0|+ (1−pm)|1⟩⟨1|ρ|1⟩⟨1|, (3)\nwhere ρandρ′are the density matrices of the pre- and post-\nmeasurement states, respectively.\nWe also account for the time-dependent noise affecting\nqubits stored in quantum memories. We assume that this\nnoise is described by two types of errors: amplitude damping\nand dephasing. Amplitude damping is associated with the\nparameter T1, which characterizes how rapidly a state loses\nits excitation, and dephasing is associated with the parameter\nT2which describes how rapidly a state loses its phase informa-\ntion [27, 28]. The amplitude damping channel acts as follows\non the density matrix ρ:\nρ7→E0ρE†\n0+E1ρE†\n1, (4)\nE0=|0⟩⟨0|+√\n1−λ|1⟩⟨1|,\nE1=√\nλ|0⟩⟨1|,\nwhere λ= 1−e−t/T1andtis the time that the qubit is stored\nin memory. The stored qubit then goes through a dephasing\n2We note that another widely accepted definition of fidelity employs a\nsquare root.\n3channel that acts as follows:\nρ7→(1−pz)ρ+pzZρZ (5)\npz=1\n2\u0010\n1−e−t/T2et/(2T1)\u0011\n,\nwhere Zis the Pauli Zgate and tis the time that the qubit\nspends in the memory. The composition of amplitude and\nphase damping as described above is thought to be a generally\neffective way to model state evolution in quantum memories\n(see discussion in [29] and references therein).\nAnother error that can occur is photon loss, one of\n(see discussion in [29] and references therein).\nAnother error that can occur is photon loss, one of the main\nobstacles in a quantum network. The probability of success-\nfully transmitting a photon over optical fiber depends on the\nfiber transmissivity ηf. The latter decreases exponentially with\ndistance (or link length) l. The probability of transmitting a\nphoton over distance lis\nηf= 10(−αf×l)/10, (6)\nwhere αfis the fiber attenuation coefficient [28].\nC. Secret Key Fraction\nA direct application of EPR pairs is entanglement-based\nQKD such as entanglement-based BB84 and the E91 proto-\ncol [13]. The secret key rate of BB84 is an increasing function\nof entanglement rate and fidelity. Recall that purification\nsacrifices EPR pairs to increase a target state’s fidelity. This\nhas the effect of reducing the entanglement generation rate,\nthus manifesting a rate-fidelity trade-off problem that makes\nit difficult to decide whether purification is beneficial. Fidelity\ninfluences the secret key rate via the secret key fraction,\nSKF BB84, given by\nSKF BB84= max(1 −h(θx)−h(θz),0) (7)\nwhere θx=Tr(ρX⊗X), θ z=Tr(ρZ⊗Z),\nX,Zare the Pauli XandZoperators, respectively; Tris\nthe matrix trace, and h(p) =−plog(p)−(1−p) log(1 −p)\nis the binary entropy [30]. The secret key rate (SKR) is the\nproduction of SKF BB84and the rate of EPR pairs with the\ndensity matrix of ρ. We later study the rate-fidelity trade-off\nof different purification schemes via secret key rate.\nD. EPR Pair Generation Model and Purification\nFigure 3 illustrates the entanglement generation setup con-\nsidered in this work: a source located between two network\nnodes distributes entanglement, with polarization encoding\nused on the photons of each state [9]. An implementation\nof this abstracted EPR pair generation scheme is introduced\nin [31]. In this scheme, each node has an atom in a cavity.\nWe label photons p1andp2and atoms a1anda2, where each\nsubscript represents the node to which these resources belong.\nThe source distribut\nnda2, where each\nsubscript represents the node to which these resources belong.\nThe source distributes states of the form\n\f\fϕ+\u000B\np1p2= (|00⟩p1p2+|11⟩p1p2)/√\n2,\nwhere horizontal polarization for piis represented by |0⟩piand\nvertical polarization by |1⟩pi. Here, we assume each attempt\nFig. 3. EPR pair generation setup. The source in the middle sends half of an\nEPR pair to each quantum network node. Each node entangles its photon with\nan atom in a cavity and measures the photon, or, in case of failure, heralds\nphoton loss to the other node.\nto generate a |ϕ+⟩p1p2state is successful at the source. Each\nphoton piis then transmitted to atom ailocated at node i.\nEach atom begins in a superposition of the ground and excited\nstates:\n|+⟩ai= (|0⟩ai+|1⟩ai)/√\n2, (8)\nwhere |0⟩airepresents the ground state and |1⟩aithe excited\nstate. After receiving a photon, each node applies a CZ\noperation on the photon and the atom, bringing the overall\nstate to\n|ψ⟩=1/2\f\fϕ+\u000B\na1a2⊗[|00⟩p1p2+|11⟩p1p2]+ (9)\n1/2\f\fψ+\u000B\na1a2⊗[|00⟩p1p2− |11⟩p1p2].\nBoth nodes then measure their photons in the diagonal basis\n(i.e,{|+⟩,|−⟩} basis), and apply corrections on the resulting\nEPR pair based on the measurement results.\nIn this last stage, upon photon measurement, a node applies\nthe Pauli Xgate on its atomic qubit if and only if it observed\n|+⟩as the outcome. Once an EPR pair is established, it\nmay be consumed directly by an application, i.e., without any\npurification; we say in this case that the nodes have performed\ndirect sharing of entanglement.\nIn the introduction, we described purification at a high level;\nhere we elaborate more. As previously mentioned, the purpose\nof purification is to increase the fidelity of a shared entangled\npair between two nodes in a quantum network. Bennett et\nal.introduced the first purification scheme in [15], sometimes\ncalled the BBPSSW protocol. In this proposal, one Werner\nstate, i.e., a state that can be expressed as\nρ=4F0−1\n3\f\fϕ+\u000B \nϕ+\f\f+1−F0\n3I4, (10)\nwith F0its initial fidel\n i.e., a state that can be expressed as\nρ=4F0−1\n3\f\fϕ+\u000B \nϕ+\f\f+1−F0\n3I4, (10)\nwith F0its initial fidelity [23], is sacrificed to increase the\nfidelity of another. In this work, we assume our entanglement\ngeneration mechanism generates Werner states as in see (10).\nSince noisy gates and noisy quantum state storage may result\nin a mixed state that is not Werner, it is often more accurate\nto relax the Werner assumption and allow input states to be a\nlinear combination of Bell states.\nFor such states, the DEJMPS protocol introduced in [17]\noutperforms BBPSSW. DEJMPS can be applied successively\nto the same EPR pair to further increase its fidelity. Such\na procedure can be carried out by the pumping scheme\nintroduced by Dür et al. in [10]. The method increases a\n4Fig. 4. An illustration of the entanglement pumping purification scheme with\nn+ 1 purification steps. The nodes begin with two EPR pairs with equal\nfidelity f0, and pump the main EPR pair (top) with sacrificial EPR pairs\n(bottom) until purification stops yielding significant benefits.\nmain EPR pair’s fidelity by consecutively purifying it with\nanother sacrificial EPR pair. In this work, we refer to each\npurification of the main EPR pair by a sacrificial EPR pair as a\npurification step ; Figure 4 illustrates this process that includes\nn+ 1purification steps. Note that with the pumping scheme,\nthe fidelity of the main EPR pair ceases to improve after a\nnumber of steps that depend on the sacrificial pair fidelity.\nFinally, as before, nodes exchange purification results via a\nclassical channel to determine if purification was successful\nor not. If any purification round fails, the entire process must\nbe restarted.\nAlthough the aforementioned purification techniques in-\ncrease entanglement fidelity, they are not optimized to use\nas few EPR pairs as possible or to yield the highest fidelity\nimprovement. Optimization techniques can be applied to pu-\nrification schemes to address these shortcomings. Krastanov et\nal.applied\nques can be applied to pu-\nrification schemes to address these shortcomings. Krastanov et\nal.applied a genetic algorithm to optimize purification circuits\nin [19]. For the noise model in their generated circuits, they\nconsidered imperfect measurement projection as in (3) and\ndepolarization in controlled gates as in (2). Some of these\ncircuits include several projective measurements and require\nthe nodes to classically communicate results as part of the\nprotocol. In our work, we evaluate our optimistic protocol on\nthe traditional pumping scheme, as well as on an optimized\ncircuit from [19].\nE. Satellite Setup\nWhile optical fiber transmissivity decreases exponentially\nwith link length, in free space, this decrease follows a poly-\nnomial trend. Consequently, the use of satellites [22, 32] and\nphoton transmission through free space have gained significant\nattention as emerging technologies that appear to make EPR\npair distribution over long distances more feasible. Neverthe-\nless, due to longer propagation delays for classical messages,\nEPR pair distribution with satellite technology potentially in-\ntroduces longer waiting times for stored quantum states. Stored\nentangled pairs thus suffer more decoherence, suggesting that\nsuch an entanglement generation setting could benefit from a\nreduction of overall classical communication.\nFigure 5 illustrates our satellite setup. We assume two\nground stations on Earth are separated by distance don the\norder of hundreds of kilometers. The satellite orbits at height\nhand is equidistant from each ground station, at distance\nlo. The satellite generates EPR pairs and sends half of each\nstate toward each ground station. Photons travel a distance lo\nthrough free space of polynomially-decreasing transmissivity,\nand, once they reach the atmosphere, are subjected to a\nFig. 5. Satellite setup for generating EPR pairs over long distances.\nfurther decrease in transmissivity – this time exponential with\natmosphere attenuation coefficient αa– fo\ner decrease in transmissivity – this time exponential with\natmosphere attenuation coefficient αa– for the remaining\ndistance to the ground station, la. In this setup, we consider\noptical links with circular apertures of diameters dsanddg\nfor the satellite and ground station, respectively, that operate\nat wavelength λ. The upper bound for transmissivity between\nthe satellite and the ground station is approximated by\nηo= min(( πd2\ns/4)(πd2\ng/4)/(λlo)2,1),\nηa= exp( −αala),\nηs=ηoηa, (11)\nwhere ηoandηaare channel transmissivities corresponding\nto free space and the atmosphere, respectively, and ηsis the\noverall transmissivity [33, 34].\nIV. P URIFICATION PROTOCOLS\nIn this section, we first discuss the traditional way of\ncarrying out purification via the pumping scheme. Recall that\nwe refer to this method as the baseline protocol (BASE) .\nWe then introduce our optimistic protocol (OPT) and finally\nintroduce the heralded-optimistic protocol (HOPT) scheme\nbriefly discussed in Sections I and II. Throughout this section,\nwe assume the time it takes for the EPR source to send out a\nnew pair of photons to Alice and Bob is negligible compared\nto the propagation delay.\nA. Baseline Protocol (BASE)\nIn quantum networks, heralding signals inform nodes of\nentanglement generation success or failure, and in case of the\nformer, may also be used to provide information about neces-\nsary correction operations. Purification, being a probabilistic\nprocedure, also requires classical information exchanges be-\ntween participating nodes. Figure 6 exemplifies the sequence\nand timing of events for baseline entanglement pumping.\nFigure 6(a) depicts a successful purification procedure, while\nFigure 6(b) depicts a purification scenario where failure occurs\nin heralding and later in purification. In Figure 6, nodes Alice\nand Bob, each equipped with two quantum memories, are\nseparated by lkm. An EPR pair source in the middle of the\nlink sends half of the pair to Alice and the other half to Bob.\nAlice and\nource in the middle of the\nlink sends half of the pair to Alice and the other half to Bob.\nAlice and Bob both know the rate of the EPR source and have\nsynchronized clocks that tell them when they should expect to\nreceive photons. Thus, upon each clock tick, any party that has\n5(a) Example execution without failures.\n(b) Example with EPR pair generation and purification failures.\nFig. 6. Baseline purification protocol event sequence and timing.\nnot received their portion of the EPR pair informs the other\nparty of the failure. At the beginning of protocol, once they\nreceive two EPR pairs, they send heralding signals, which take\nat least l/cseconds to transmit, where cis the speed of light in\noptical fiber – 200,000 km/s. Then they perform purification\nand send the results through a classical channel while waiting\nfor the purification results.\nIn the following, we go through the timeline presented in\nFigure 6: The nodes (i)receive their portion of the main\nentangled pair from the midpoint source, (ii)receive their\nportion of an auxiliary (sacrificial) entangled pair, (iii)her-\nald entanglement generation success/failure. These steps are\nrepeated until both pairs are successfully received. Next, the\nnodes (iv)execute a set of quantum gates and measurements\non both sides, and (v)exchange measurement results via\nclassical messages. The nodes then compare results, and if\npurification succeeds, they repeat the process from step (ii)\nuntil a desired number of purification steps is achieved. If the\nresults indicate that purification failed, the nodes discard the\n(a) Example execution without failures.\n(b) Example with entanglement generation failure.

If on the other hand, either\nparty receives no photon, then a failure signal is sent. As soon\nas two EPR pairs are established, the nodes initiate purification\nas outlined above.\nB.\nent. As soon\nas two EPR pairs are established, the nodes initiate purification\nas outlined above.\nB. Optimistic Protocol (OPT)\nThe main idea behind the optimistic protocol is to proceed\nwith all purification steps without waiting for any heralding\nor consistency checks until the very end. Figure 7 illustrates\nthe optimistic protocol timeline, where Alice and Bob are\nequipped with the same hardware as in the baseline setup.\nPanel 7(a) depicts a scenario where all entanglement gen-\neration attempts and purification steps are successful, while\npanel 7(b), presents a scenario in which Bob does not receive\nhis portion of an EPR pair, and the procedure is restarted.\nIn the following, we go through the timeline of Figure 7: (i)\nAlice and Bob receive their portion of the main and sacrificial\nEPR pairs from a midpoint source and each node that receives\nher/his portion does not wait for the heralding signal and will\ncontinue to execute required quantum gates for purification. A\nnode that does not receive one or both photons will inform the\nother party of failure, causing all pairs to be discarded, and\nthe process to restart. Upon success, the nodes go to step (ii),\nwhere they execute local quantum gates and measurements to\ncarry out purification, then they exchange purification results\nbut they do not wait to receive them from the other end.\nThe nodes then (iii)receive the next sacrificial EPR pair and\nperform another round of purification without waiting for any\nheralding signals or purification results. As previously, if a\nnode detects entanglement generation failure or purification\n6failure, it informs its partner, taking the process back to step\n(i). The nodes repeat step (iii)until a desired number of\npurification steps are completed. Finally, the nodes (iv)check\nthe final purification measurement outcomes to verify whether\nthe purification steps were successful, going back to step\n(i)in case a failure occurs. Note that in a setup where the\npropagation delay is larger th\nk to step\n(i)in case a failure occurs. Note that in a setup where the\npropagation delay is larger than the time takes for the EPR\nsource to send out a new pair of photons to Alice and Bob, end\nnodes do not check the results at the very end of a purification\nprocedure, but they check the purification/heralding results in\ntime when they are waiting to receive a new EPR pair and\ndetermine the next action based on the purification/heralding\nresults.\nC. Heralded Optimistic Protocol (HOPT)\nWe now introduce the heralded-optimistic protocol (HOPT)\nwhich lies between the optimistic and baseline approaches.\nIn this protocol, Alice and Bob wait only for each others’\nheralding signals – they are optimistic about purification\nresults and exchange them only at the very end of the process.\nThis protocol was first introduced by Hartmann et al. [20], and\nits distance scalability was later studied in [21].\nIn this work, we modify the original HOPT protocol such\nthat end-nodes do not wait until the end of the whole purifica-\ntion procedure to exchange the purification results, instead they\ncan exchange the purification results as soon as they measure\ntheir qubits. This modification allows Alice and Bob to be\ninformed of purification failures earlier than the original pro-\ntocol [20] that checks at the very end, thereby preventing them\nfrom wasting EPR pairs on a failed purification. Because of\nearly notice of purification failure, this modification improves\nthe overall rate compared to the original protocol. We compare\nour proposed OPT with the improved HOPT.\nV. E VALUATION\nIn this section, we compare OPT to BASE, HOPT, and\nsharing EPR pairs with no purification (NOP). We begin with\nthe pumping scheme of [18] for ground- and satellite-based\nsettings, then continue with current state-of-the-art purification\ncircuits of [19] for ground-based EPR generation. For entan-\nglement pumping, we calculate the average rate and fidelity as\na function of the total number of purification steps for \ncalculate the average rate and fidelity as\na function of the total number of purification steps for a fixed\nhardware parameter set. Additionally, we examine the effect\nof different memory coherence times and EPR source rates on\nfidelity. We evaluate the circuit of [19] in a similar manner.\nLast, we evaluate the QKD performance of different protocols\nfor ground- and satellite-based EPR generation schemes. To\ndo so, we calculate the SKR for ground- and satellite-based\nsetups for all protocols and show that, the optimistic protocol\nyields the highest SKR when memory coherence times and\ninitial fidelities are low.\nA.

Average fidelity increases with rate; the\nimprovement becomes negligible beyond 106Hz.\ntanglement, as well as the average SKR. For each simulation,\nwe ascertain that the confidence interval is less than three\npercent of the average value. For all simulations, the noise\nparameters for gates, measurements, and memories are the\nsame. For controlled gates, we assume depolarization with\nparameter pg= 0.99, as per [19] (see (2)). We assume\nimperfect measurement projection with parameter pm= 0.99,\nas per [19] (see (3)). For memory noise, we assume amplitude\ndamping ( T1) and dephasing ( T2) (see (4) and (5)). Since\nin our evaluation, we do not store qubits in memory for a\nlong time (at most, in the regime of milliseconds) and T1for\namplitude damping is typically on the order of minutes – e.g.,\n[27] reports a T1of at least six minutes for Nitrogen-Vacancy\n(NV) center in diamond carbon atoms – it is not a significant\nsource of noise for a stored qubit. However, we include it in\nour simulation, setting T1to six minutes. On the other hand, T2\nis on the order of milliseconds, and up to seconds as observed\nin experiments [27, 35]. For T2, we evaluate our scheme from\n0.001s up to 1s, increasing at a logarithmic scale. We set the\nfiber attenuation coefficient αfto 0.2 as in [28]. We select\ninitial fidelity F0from the range 0.75 to 0.90. µis selected\nfrom the range 1 KHz to 1 GHz [32, 36].

The atmosphere extinction attenuation, αa, is set\nto 0.028125 [33]. Sender and receiver hardware parameters\nare set to a wavelength λ= 737 nm, a satellite optical link\naperture ds= 0.2m, and a ground station optical link aperture\ndg= 2 m [33].\nB. Pumping Scheme\nIn this section, we evaluate the effect of the number of\npurification steps on average fidelity and rate. Then we study\nthe effect of distance ( d) on average fidelity. Next, we study\nthe effect of coherence time ( T2) and EPR source rate ( µ)\non average fidelity. We compare OPT with HOPT, BASE, and\nNOP in a ground-based setup. For all cases, we do at most five\nsteps of purification in the pumping scheme as going further\ndoes not improve fidelity significantly. We limit the number\nof memories to two for each node, the required number of\nmemories for each step of the pumping scheme. We set\nF0= 0.9,µ= 1GHz, T2= 0.001s, and d= 20 km; and plot\nthe results for fidelity and rate in Figure 8(a) and Figure 8(b)\nrespectively. We observe in Figuer 8(a) that OPT outperforms\n8Fig. 13. Fidelity comparison for different protocols implementing entangle-\nment pumping in satellite-based setup, for distance ( d) from 100 km up to\n500 km. For each data point of purification protocols, we plot the highest\nfidelity over five purification steps. We set initial fidelity ( F0) to 0.9, EPR\nsource rate ( µ) to 1 GHz, and\ner five purification steps. We set initial fidelity ( F0) to 0.9, EPR\nsource rate ( µ) to 1 GHz, and memory coherence time ( T2) to 10 ms.\nFig. 14. The effect of memory coherence time ( T2) on the average fidelity\nin the satellite-based setup. The initial fidelity ( F0) and the EPR source rate\n(µ) are set to 0.9 and 1 GHz, respectively. Increasing T2causes purification\nprotocols to converge to the same fidelity.\nall other protocols, while BASE and HOPT yield fidelities\nlower than NOP. We also observe in Figure 8(b) that OPT\nyields a lower rate compared to other protocols, however, the\nhigher rates of HOPT and BASE do not compensate for their\nlower fidelity. Next, we study the effect of don average output\nfidelity. We plot the highest fidelity achieved over five steps of\npurification in Figure 9, note that for OPT, step five always has\nthe highest fidelity, while for BASE or HOPT this may not be\nthe case (see Figure 8(a)). NOP is also included in the plot. We\nfind that OPT outperforms other protocols, and by increasing\nd, the difference between OPT and other purification protocols\nincreases. Furthermore, an increase in dleads to a longer\nwaiting time, which results in a decrease in the fidelity of\nboth BASE and HOPT, causing them to fall below the fidelity\nof NOP. Moreover, for larger d, the difference between HOPT\nand BASE decreases as they perform fewer purification steps\nand when they decrease to one step their performance becomes\nthe same.\nWe next analyze the effect of T2on the average fidelity\nof all protocols for F0= 0.9,d= 5,20km, and µ= 1\nGHz. To investigate the impact of T2, we compare average\nFig. 15.

As µdecreases, each\nqubit spends more time in memory and therefore is subjected\nto decoherence for a longer period. By increasing µ, output\nfidelity increases; however, when the rate surpasses 1 MHz,\noutput fidelity improvement is negligible for all protocols.\nFig. 19. The effect of source rate on output fidelity for the optimized circuit in\nground-based setup. Initial fidelity ( F0), distance ( d), a\nt fidelity for the optimized circuit in\nground-based setup. Initial fidelity ( F0), distance ( d), and memory coherence\ntime ( T2) are set to 0.9, 5 km, and 1 ms, respectively.\nC. Satellite-based EPR Generation Setup\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of all\npurification protocols, implementing a pumping scheme, in\na satellite-based setup. Similar to the ground-based setup,\nthe maximum number of purification steps is five, as beyond\nfive steps the fidelity does not improve significantly. We\nrestrict each node to have a maximum of two memories,\nthe minimum number of memories for each step of the\npumping scheme. Since the distances between two end nodes\nare significantly larger compared to the ground-based setup,\nmemory decoherence becomes more severe. Consequently,\nhaving a memory with a coherence time of 1ms significantly\nreduces overall fidelity due to the large waiting time induced\nby classical communication; we therefore set the coherence\ntime to 10ms for fidelity and rate evaluation. We plot the\naverage fidelity as a function of number of purification\nsteps in Figure 12(a) for F0= 0.9,µ= 1 GHz, d= 500\nkm, and T2= 10 ms. We observe that OPT provides\nthe highest average fidelity, while HOPT and BASE yield\nlower fidelities compared to NOP. For the same parameters,\nwe plot the average entanglement rate as a function of\nnumber of purification steps in Figure 12(b). We observe\nthat the average entanglement rate under OPT is lower than\nother protocols; however, the average entanglement rates of\nHOPT and BASE are lower than NOP. This brings up the\nrate-fidelity trade-off problem, which we study in Section V-E.\nNext, we explore the effect of inter node distance don\naverage fidelity in Figure 13. We observe that OPT exhibits\nsuperior performance compared to the other protocols, and\nasdincreases, the performance gap widens. In addition, an\nincrease in dleads to a longer EPR pairs storage time in noisy\nmemories, which results in a decrease in the performance of\nBA\nonger EPR pairs storage time in noisy\nmemories, which results in a decrease in the performance of\nBASE and HOPT, causing them to fall below that of NOP.\nWe then analyze the effect of T2andµon the average\nfidelities of all protocols. To study the effect of T2, we fix µ\nto 1 GHz and F0to 0.9 for distances of 200 and 500 km.\nWe plot average fidelity as a function of T2in Figure 14.\nWe observe that OPT yields the highest fidelity, but that, as\n100.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n05101520253035\nBaseline\nN/AOptimistic(a) Ground-based setup with 1 KHz EPR source rate ( µ) andd= 20\nkm.\n0.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n200040006000800010000120001400016000\nOptimistic(b) Ground-based setup with 1 MHz EPR source rate ( µ) and\nd= 20 km.\n0.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n0246810\nOptimistic\nN/AHeralded\nOptimistic\n(c) Satellite-based setup with 1 KHz EPR source rate ( µ) and d=\n500 km.\n0.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n2000400060008000\nOptimistic(d) Satellite-based setup with 1 MHz EPR source rate ( µ) and d=\n500 km.\nFig. 20.

We demarcate\ndifferent regions with dashed lines and label each region to show the best protocol for QKD in that region. The ‘N/A’ label indicates values of ( F0,T2)\nwhere no positive SKR can be achieved.\nT2increases, all purification protocols converge to the same\nfidelity value and once T2= 0.5sthe difference is negligible.\nFor evaluating the effect µon the average fidelity, we set\nF0= 0.9andT2= 10 ms. We plot average fidelity as a\nfunction of µin Figure 15, where we observe that increasing\nµimproves average fidelity and that after µ= 1 MHz this\nimprovement is negligible.\nOur analysis shows a significant decrease in final average fi-\ndelities in the satellite scenario due to large classical communi-\ncation latencies. For example in Figure 12(a), we observ\nte scenario due to large classical communi-\ncation latencies. For example in Figure 12(a), we observe that\nOPT only increases fidelity to ∼0.75, which is not suitable for\nmany applications. Some applications such as QKD [2, 13, 30],\nallow end nodes to measure their qubits as soon as they receive\nor purify them and continue to receive EPR pairs and/or\npurify them; and at the meantime, exchange the heralding and\npurification results to see whether purification was successful\nor not to filter out failed EPR pairs. We calculate fidelity and\nthe rate with the modification in which end nodes measure\ntheir qubits before the final confirmation. We show fidelity\nand rate as a function of number of purification steps for the\nsame hardware parameters set previously in Figure 16(a) and\nFigure 16(b), respectively. We observe that average fidelity\nincreases due to the decrease in waiting time. This reduction\nin wait time also improves the overall rates of all protocols\nand amplifies OPT’s rate to surpass those of BASE and HOPT.\nD. Optimized Purification Circuit\nWe now evaluate the benefit of optimism in the context of\na circuit generated by a genetic algorithm introduced in [19].To do so, we remove amplitude-damping noise in quantum\nmemories since the genetic algorithm of [19] does not support\nthis noise model. However, as discussed previously, we do not\nexpect this to have a significant impact on results since qubits\nare stored in memories for relatively short periods of time, on\nthe order of milliseconds. For evaluation, we use the genetic al-\ngorithm to produce an optimized circuit similar to the original\nL17 circuit of [19] that has the same performance in terms of\nfidelity improvement and average number of consumed EPR\npairs. The circuit has 17 operations and requires nine EPR\npairs and three quantum memories. We selected L17 as the\nbasis of our design since it outperforms the STRINGENT\nprotocol [25]. To evaluate fidelity and rate, we set µ= 1GHz\nandT2= 0.001 s, the same as \n STRINGENT\nprotocol [25]. To evaluate fidelity and rate, we set µ= 1GHz\nandT2= 0.001 s, the same as the ground-based pumping\nscheme evaluation. Average fidelity and average rate as a\nfunction of dcan be found in Figure 17(a) and Figure 17(b),\nrespectively. We find that the OPT outperforms other protocols\nin terms of fidelity. Further, BASE and HOPT yield lower\nfidelities than NOP for longer distances. OPT achieves higher\nrates than the other protocols for d \u003C4.3km.\nNext, we evaluate the effect of T2andµon average fidelity\nfor a 5 km link. We plot average fidelity as a function of T2in\nFigure 18 for F0= 0.9andµ= 1 GHz. As T2increases, the\nfidelity difference between OPT and other protocols decreases,\nbecoming negligible for T2\u003E0.1s. We also study the effect\nofµon the average fidelity in Figure 19. We observe that by\nincreasing µ, average fidelity improves, and when µsurpasses\n1 MHz, this improvement is negligible.\n110.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n05101520\nBaseline\nO.\nN/ANOP(a) Ground-based setup with 1 KHz EPR source rate ( µ) and d= 20\nkm.\n0.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n200300400500\nOptimistic(b) Ground-based setup with 1 MHz EPR source rate ( µ) and d= 20\nkm.\n0.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85 0.87 0.89\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n012345678\nHeralded Optimistic\nOptimistic\nN/A NOP\n(c) Satellite-based setup with 1 KHz EPR source rate ( µ) and d= 500\nkm.\n0.75 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.83 0.85\nF01\n0.2\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001T2\n30405060708090100110\nOptimistic(d) Satellite-based setup with 1 MHz EPR source rate ( µ) and d= 500\nkm.\nFig. 21.

We demarcate\ndifferent regions with dashed lines and label them to indicate the protocol with the highest QKD SKR for each region. ‘NOP’ indicates generating secret keys\nwithout any purification and ‘O.’ stands for optimistic. We indicate the regions where SKR is zero with ‘N/A’ label.\nE\ncation and ‘O.’ stands for optimistic. We indicate the regions where SKR is zero with ‘N/A’ label.\nE. Secret Key Rate Evaluation\nIn this section, we study the rate-fidelity trade-off for all\nprotocols by evaluating their performance in the context of\nBB84’s SKR [30]. In previous descriptions (see Figures 6 and\n7), all protocols wait for the final confirmation and purification\nresults, and users do not receive new EPR pairs while waiting.\nIn the case of QKD, we make the modification that end nodes\nmeasure the EPR pair of a purification procedure prior to\nthe final confirmation so that the measurement output can be\nsent along with purification and heralding results; this way,\ntheir memories are free and able to receive new EPR pairs,\nallowing the generation of the next secret key bit to proceed.\nThis modification for QKD yields the greatest benefit where\ndistances between end nodes are large, such as a satellite\nsetting. Similar to previous sections, we study the effect T2,\nd,F0, and µon the secret key rate in ground-based and\nsatellite-based scenarios. We evaluate QKD performance for\nthe pumping scheme and the optimized purification circuit\nof [19]. In our simulations, we set dto20and500 km\nfor ground- and satellite-based settings, respectively. We set\nµequal to 1 KHz and 1 MHz for both scenarios (for the\nevaluation of 10 KHz and 100 KHz of pumping scheme see\nAppendix A). In all cases, we consider a range of values for T2\nand initial fidelity F0. We display the maximum SKR across all\nprotocols for each combination of F0(x-axis) and T2(y-axis).\nWe partition different regions of the heatmap with dashed lines\nto indicate which protocol achieved the maximum SKR foreach (F0, T2)pair.\nFor entanglement pumping, presented in Figure 20, our\nstudy indicates that at T2= 0.01,F0in the range of 0.79\nto 0.85, and µ= 1 KHz, OPT outperforms other variants.\nIncreasing T2andF0improves the performance of BASE\nand HOPT (see Figure 20(a) for ground-based setup and\nFigure 20(c) for satell\nhe performance of BASE\nand HOPT (see Figure 20(a) for ground-based setup and\nFigure 20(c) for satellite-based setup). By increasing µto 1\nMHz, the OPT approach outperforms other approaches for\nall(F0, T2)(see Figure 20(b) for ground-based setup and\nFigure 20(d) for satellite-based setup).\nFor the purification circuit of [19], we modified the fitness\nfunction of the genetic algorithm to generate a new circuit\noptimized to the SKR of BB84 (the original algorithm’s fitness\nfunction aims at maximizing the output fidelity). Moreover, we\nconsider storage noise while generating the circuit. We gener-\nate a circuit that uses three memories with T2of 0.01, requires\nfive EPR pairs of initial fidelity 0.75, and has at its disposal\na 1 KHz EPR source. Figure 21 presents the performance\nof the circuit for all three purification protocols. Similar to\nthe pumping scheme, we observe that OPT outperforms other\nprotocols when F0andT2are low(see Figures 21(a) and 21(c)\nfor ground-based and satellite-based setups respectively). It\nis worth mentioning that our generated circuit outperforms\nthe pumping protocol, in that it is capable of achieving a\npositive SKR using OPT, in cases where F0andT2are so low\nthat the pumping protocol can not yield a key. For example,\nFigure 21(a), for T2= 0.01andF0= 0.75, shows that the\n12optimized circuit utilizing our optimistic protocol can generate\na secret key, while pumping cannot generate any secret key\n(see SKR for T2= 0.01andF0≤0.78in Figure 20(a)).\nSimilar to the pumping scheme, by increasing the EPR source\nrate to 1 MHz, the optimistic protocol outperforms other\nprotocols for all (F0, T2)(see Figures 21(b) and 21(d) for\nground- and satellite-based setups respectively).\nVI. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nIn this work, we proposed optimism in purification circuits.\nOur study showed that being optimistic about heralding signals\nand purification results can be advantageous to fidelity and,\nin some hardware parameter regimes, to overall purified EPR\nlts can be advantageous to fidelity and,\nin some hardware parameter regimes, to overall purified EPR\nrate in classic purification schemes ( e.g., entanglement pump-\ning) and optimized purification circuits of [19], compared to\nbaseline ( i.e., herald all EPR pairs, check every purification\nresult) and heralded-optimistic ( i.e., herald EPR pairs, ex-\nchange purification results only while heralding) approaches.\nWe study the effects of memory and gate noise; EPR source\nrate, and node distance on the performance of our proposed\noptimistic protocol and compare it to the aforementioned\nprotocols. As part of a future direction, we aim to evaluate\nour proposed scheme on real hardware such as NV centers in\ndiamond [27, 28, 38]. Moreover, we aim to test our approach\non a quantum repeater chain and analyze the effect of different\nparameters on the output fidelity and overall end-to-end EPR\nrate. The optimistic approach can also be applied to GHZ\nstate [39] distribution schemes. In [40] authors proposed a\nprocedure to distribute a quadripartite GHZ state between\nfour end nodes. This involves generating four Bell pairs and\napplying purification, then applying a procedure called fusion\n(for an optimized version of GHZ distribution and fusion see\n[41]) to generate the desired quadripartite GHZ. We expect\nthat for such a task, the optimistic approach would benefit\nboth fidelity and rate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research was supported in part by the NSF grant CNS-\n1955744, NSF-ERC Center for Quantum Networks grant EEC-\n1941583, and MURI ARO Grant W911NF2110325.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

One widely used framework is neural belief propagation\n(NBP), which unfolds the belief propagation (BP) iterations into a deep neural network and the\nparameters are trained in a data-driven manner. NBP decoders have been shown to improve\nupon classical decoding algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the generalization capabilities\nof NBP decoders. Specifically, the generalization gap of a decoder is the difference between em-\npirical and expected bit-error-rate(s). We present new theoretical results which bound this gap\nand show the dependence on the decoder complexity , in terms of code parameters (blocklength,\nmessage length, variable/check node degrees), decoding iterations, and the training dataset size.\nResults are presented for both regular and irregular parity-check matrices. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first set of theoretical results on generalization performance of neural net-\nwork based decoders. We present experimental results to show the dependence of generalization\ngap on the training dataset size, and decoding iterations for different codes.\n1 Introduction\n1Deep neural networks have emerged as an important tool in 5G and beyond for hybrid beam-\nforming [2–4], channel encoding, decoding, and estimation [5–19], modulation classification [20–22],\nand physical layer algorithms [23–25]. Within the context of channel decoding, prior works have\ndemonstrated that deep neural network based decoders achieve lower bit/frame error rates than\nconventional iterative decoding algorithms such as belief propagation in several si\nerror rates than\nconventional iterative decoding algorithms such as belief propagation in several signal-to-noise ratio\n1This work was supported by NSF grants CAREER 1651492, CCF-2100013, CNS-2209951, CNS-1822071, CIF-\n1855879, CCSS-2027844, CCSS-2052751, and NSF-ERC 1941583.

In another line of works [26–28], deep neural networks have been\nused to jointly design both encoder and decoder. Given the expansive applicability of deep neu-\nral networks for channel encoding and decoding, we note here that determining neural network\narchitectures that generalize well to large block length codewords is an active area of research.\nIterative decoding algorithms (such as belief propagation (BP)) are commonly deployed for\ndecoding linear codes; and are known to be equivalent to maximum aposteriori (MAP) decoding\nwhen the Tanner graph does not contain short cycles [29]. However, if the Tanner graph contains\nshort cycles, then BP can be sub-optimal i.e., the messages passed between the variable nodes and\nparity check nodes cannot correctly recover the transmitted codeword [5, 30, 31]. One approach\nto mitigate the effect of short cycles is by generalizing the BP algorithm by means of a deep\nlearning based approach [5–13]. It is shown that the weights learnt by optimizing over the training\ndata ensure that any message repetition between the\ne weights learnt by optimizing over the training\ndata ensure that any message repetition between the variable nodes and parity check nodes do\nnot adversely impact the performance of BP based decoders [5, 6]. We refer to this class of belief\npropagation decoders as Neural Belief Propagation (NBP) decoders. The salient aspect of NBP\ndecoders is that its structure is determined from the corresponding Tanner graph, and therefore its\narchitecture is a function of the code parameters itself. Several variants of NBP decoders have been\na subject of recent study [7–13]. In [7], the authors propose a hardware efficient implementation of\nthe NBP decoder by reducing the number of matrix multiplications. The authors in [9] implement\nmessage passing on graph neural networks wherein the output of each variable node is computed\nusing a sub-network. An interesting variant of NBP decoder was proposed in [11] in which the\nunimportant check nodes were pruned in each decoding iteration thereby resulting in a architecture\nthat corresponds to a different parity check matrix at each iteration. The authors in [12] propose\ncorrecting the output of conventional decoding algorithms using a NBP decoder thereby combining\nthe desirable features of both conventional and NBP decoders. A knowledge distillation based\ntechnique to learn the node activations in NBP decoder was proposed in [13].\nPost-training, it is important that the NBP decoder achieves low bit-error-rate (BER) on unseen\nnoisy codewords. Prior works on NBP decoders [7–13] are empirical; to the best of our knowledge\nthere are no theoretical guarantees on the performance of NBP decoders on unseen data. To this\nend, given a NBP decoder, our goal is to understand how its architecture impacts its generalization\ngap [32], defined as the difference between empirical and expected BER(s). Motivated by the\nabove discussion, we ask the following fundamental question: Given a NBP decoder, what is the\nexpected performance on unseen noisy codewords\nundamental question: Given a NBP decoder, what is the\nexpected performance on unseen noisy codewords? And how is the generalization gap related to code\nparameters, neural decoder architecture and training dataset size?\nThere are several approaches to obtaining generalization gap bounds in the theoretical machine\nlearning literature, which can be classified into two primary categories. The first category comprises\ndata-independent approaches, such as VC-dimension, Rademacher complexity of the function class,\nand PAC-Bayes [32–41]. The second category focuses on data-dependent approaches, which analyze\nthe mutual information between the input dataset and the algorithm output [42,43]. VC-dimension\nis a measure of the number of samples required to find a probably approximately correct (PAC)\nhypothesis from the entire hypothesis class [44–46]. Rademacher complexity measures the correla-\ntion between the function class and the random labels [32]; it is known that generalization bounds\n2obtained via Rademacher complexity (and it’s variants) are tighter than the bounds obtained using\nthe VC-dimension approach [37]. Another method is the PAC-Bayes analysis, where generalization\ngap is bounded by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the posterior on the\nlearned weights. The prior is chosen to be a multi-variate normal distribution centred around the\ninitial weights [35, 47–49]. In [50], the authors propose the measuring the change in the training\nerror with respect to perturbations in the model weights as a measure of its generalizability. Recent\nliterature has increasingly focused on analyzing machine learning-based communication systems,\nparticularly in terms of the generalization gap. For instance, [51] investigates generalization bounds\nin the context of codebook design and decoder selection in both uncoded and coded communication\nsystems. This paper specifically examines a setting where the encoder and decoder are learned in a\ndata-driven manner. In unco\nically examines a setting where the encoder and decoder are learned in a\ndata-driven manner. In uncoded systems, the authors consider minimum distance decoders, while\nin coded systems, they focus on learning decoders by maximizing the mutual information between\nthe input and the channel output. The study highlights how the generalization gap scales with\ncodebook size, the number of noise samples, and input dimensionality. Additionally, [52] addresses\nthe learning of decoders for predetermined codebooks. Drawing inspiration from the support vec-\ntor machine paradigm, the authors propose a nearest neighbor decoder, the parameters of which\nare learned in a data-driven manner. The paper also derives bounds for the generalization gap\nof this learned decoder. For the scope of this paper, we adopt the PAC learning framework and\nuse Rademacher Complexity to understand the generalization gap of NBP decoders. The nota-\ntions introduced throughout the paper are summarized in Table 1. We next summarize our main\ncontributions.\nMain Contributions:\n1.Generalization gap as a function of the covering number of the NBP decoder : In this paper,\nwe first upper bound the generalization gap of a generic deep learning decoder as a function of\nthe Rademacher complexity of the individual bits of the decoder output (which we denote as\nthe bit-wise Rademacher complexity). We next consider NBP decoders which belong to the\nclass of belief propagation decoders whose architecture is a function of the code parameters.\nWe upper bound the bit-wise Rademacher complexity as a function of the covering number\nof the NBP decoder, which is the cardinality of the set of all decoders that can closely\napproximate the NBP decoder. The covering number analysis provides an upper bound with\na linear dependence of the generalization gap on spectral norm of the weight matrices and\npolynomial dependence on the decoding iterations. The bound we obtain is tighter than\nthe other approaches such as VC-dimension and PAC\nng iterations. The bound we obtain is tighter than\nthe other approaches such as VC-dimension and PAC-Bayes approaches in which the upper\nbound exponentially depends on the decoding iterations.\n2.Upper bounds on bit-wise Rademacher complexity for regular and irregular parity check matri-\nces: We upper bound the covering number of NBP decoder in terms of the code-parameters\n(blocklength, variable node degree, check node degree), and the training dataset size for both\nregular and irregular parity check matrices. From our results, we show that the generalization\ngap scales with the inverse of the square root of the dataset size, linearly with the variable\nnode degree and the decoding iterations, and the square-root of the blocklength.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\nempirically studies the generalization gap of NBP decoders. In the experimental results, we\nconsider binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation and additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) channel. We use Tanner code to illustrate the dependence of the generalization\ngap on the decoding iterations, and training dataset size. To study the dependence of the\ngeneralization gap on the blocklength, we consider two QC-LDPC parent codes, and generate\ndescendent codes with smaller blocklengths by puncturing the parent code. We assume that\nall-zero codewords are transmitted, and the NBP decoder is trained on the noisy realizations\ngenerated for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

1: (a) End-to-End block diagram for communication using neural belief propagation (NBP)\ndecoders for linear block codes; (b) Architecture of the NBP decoder for Tdecoding iterations\nwhere each decoding iteration corresponds to 2 hidden layers: (1) variable node layer, (2) parity\ncheck node layer.\n2 Preliminaries and Problem Statement\nIn Fig. 1, we consider a linear block code denoted by Cof blocklength nand message length\nk. Let the code Cbe characterized by a regular parity check matrix H∈ {0,1}(n−k)×n, and we\ndenote the Tanner graph as G= (V,P,E); where V={v1,···, vn}is the set of variable nodes,\nP={p1,···, pn−k}is the set of parity check nodes, and E={e1,···, endv}is the set of edges.\nHere, dvrepresents the variable node degree, i.e., the number of parity checks a variable node\nparticipates in. Let {vi, pj}denote the edge in the Tanner graph Gconnecting variable node vito\nparity check node pj.V(vj) ={pi|H[i, j] = 1}denote the set of parity check nodes adjacent to\nthe variable node vjin the Tanner graph G. Similarly, P(pi) ={vj|H[i, j] = 1}denote the set of\nva\nto\nthe variable node vjin the Tanner graph G. Similarly, P(pi) ={vj|H[i, j] = 1}denote the set of\nvariable nodes adjacent to the parity check node piinG.\nLetY ⊆Rnbe the space of ndimensional channel outputs, X ⊆ { 0,1}nbe the space of n\ndimensional codewords, U ⊆ { 0,1}kbe the space of kdimensional messages, and Z ⊆Rnbe the\nspace of ndimensional channel noise. The message u= [u[1],···,u[k]]⊤∈ U is encoded to the\ncodeword x= [x[1],···,x[n]]⊤∈ X. The channel is assumed to be memoryless, described by\nPr(y|x) =Qn\ni=1Pr(y[i]|x[i]). The receiver receives the channel output y= [y[1],···,y[n]]⊤∈ Y;\nwhich is the codeword xmodulated, and corrupted with independently and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) additive noise z= [z[1],···,z[n]]⊤∈ Z.\nThe goal of the decoder is to recover the message ufrom the channel output y. The input to\nthe decoder is the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the posterior probabilities denoted by λ∈Rn×1\nand is given as λ[i] = logPr(x[i]=0|y[i])\nPr(x[i]=1|y[i]), for 1 ≤i≤n. Denote the output of the NBP decoder with\nTdecoding iterations as ˆ x=f(λ), where f(·) denotes the decoding function.\nThe architecture of the NBP decoder is derived from the trellis representation of Gand illus-\ntrated in Fig. 1(b). Each decoding iteration t(where, 1 ≤t≤T) corresponds to two hidden layers\neach of width |E|=ndv, namely: (1) variable layer vt, (2) parity check layer pt. The hidden nodes\nin layers vtandptcorrespond to the messages passed along the edges of the Tanner graph G. For\ninstance, the output of the node vt[{l, m}] in the NBP decoder corresponds to the message passed\nfrom variable node vlto parity check node pmin the t-th iteration, and is given as,\n5vt[{l, m}] =W(t)\n1[{l, m}, l]λ[l] +X\nm′∈V(l)\\mW(t)\n2[{l, m},{l, m′}]pt−1[{l, m′}], (1)\nwhere, pt−1[{l, m′}] corresponds to the message passed from the parity check node pm′to the\nvariable node vlin the ( t−1)-th iteration. For t= 1, we have p0= [0,···,0]⊤.W(t)\n1∈Rndv×n, and\nW(t)\n2∈Rndv×ndvare sparse weight matrices trai\n. For t= 1, we have p0= [0,···,0]⊤.W(t)\n1∈Rndv×n, and\nW(t)\n2∈Rndv×ndvare sparse weight matrices trained using backpropagation in the t-th decoding\niteration. W(t)\n1is strictly a lower triangular matrix with exactly dvnon-zero entries in every\ncolumn, and one non-zero entry in every row. W(t)\n2has exactly dv−1 non-zero entries in every\nrow, and dv−1 non-zero entries in every column. We consider that the t-th decoding iteration is\ncharacterized by weight matrices W(t)\n1, and W(t)\n2, where tcan take integer values t∈ {1,···, T}.\nThe output of the parity check node layer in the t-th decoding iteration for the NBP decoder is,\npt[{l, m}] = 2 tanh−1\nY\nl′∈P(m)\\ltanh\u0012vt[{l′, m}]\n2\u0013\n (2)\nImplementing (2) is computationally expensive in hardware due to the multiplicative operations\nand hyperbolic functions. For practical implementation, (2) can be made computationally feasible\nby using the min-sum operation, which is described as follows:\npt[{l, m}] =Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}]) min\nl′∈P(m)\\l|vt[{l′, m}]|. (3)\nWe note that learnable parameters can be incorporated into the min-sum operations. Specifically,\nthe output of the parity check node layer can be scaled with weights as follows:\npt[{l, m}] =βt[{l, m}]Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}])˜ pt[{l, m}]. (4)\nThe parameter vector βtis learned in a data-driven manner. Alternatively, the output of the parity\ncheck node layer can be offset using the parameter βtas follows:\npt[{l, m}] =Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}])ReLu (˜ pt[{l, m}]−βt[{l, m}]). (5)\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the scenario where the learnable parameters are used solely\nfor computing the output of the variable node layer. The estimated codeword after Tdecoding\niterations in the NBP decoder is given as,\nˆ x[l] =s(W(T)\n4[l, l]λ[l] +X\nm′∈V(l)W(T)\n3[l,{l, m′}]pT[{l, m′}]) (6)\nwhere, W3∈Rn×ndv,W4∈Rn×n, and s(·) is the sigmoid activation. W3is strictly an upper\n6triangular matrix with exactly dvnon-zero entries in every row, while W4is a diagonal matrix.\nThe NBP decoder \n matrix with exactly dvnon-zero entries in every row, while W4is a diagonal matrix.\nThe NBP decoder (denoted by f(·)) is characterized by the following four sparse weight matrices:\n(a)W(t)\n1, where t= 1,···, T, (b) W(t)\n2, where t= 1,···, T, (c)W3, and (d) W4. The weight\nmatrices are learnt by training the NBP decoder to minimize the bit error rate (BER) loss that is\ndefined as,\nlBER(f(λ),x) =dH(f(λ),x)\nn=Pn\nj=1 1(f(λ)[j]̸=x[j])\nn. (7)\nHere, dH(·,·) denotes the Hamming distance, and 1(·) denotes the indicator function. In prac-\ntice, we train the NBP decoder to minimize the BER loss over the dataset S={(λj,xj)}m\nj=1\ncomprising of pairs of log-likelihood ratio and its corresponding codeword. Then, we define the\nempirical risk of fasˆRBER(f) =1\nmmP\nj=1lBER(f(λj),xj). The true risk of fis defined as RBER(f) =\nEλ,x[lBER(f(λ),x)].\nProblem Statement. The generalization gap is defined as the difference RBER(f)−ˆRBER(f).\nThe main goal of this paper is to understand the behavior of the generalization gap (specifically\nupper bounds) as a function of a) training dataset size, m, b) the complexity of the NBP decoder,\nin terms of the number of decoding iterations Tand c) code parameters, such as message length k,\nblocklength n, variable node degree dv, parity check node degree dc.\n3 Main Results\nIn this section, we present our main results on the generalization gap for NBP decoders. Let\nS={(λj,xj)}m\nj=1be the training dataset, and we assume that the dataset is i.i.d from a fixed\ndistribution. Let FTbe a class of NBP decoders with Tdecoding iterations. For the scope of\nthis paper, we focus on the family of NBP decoders whose non-zero weight entries are bounded\nby a constant w. Specifically, we assume that for every ( i, j) and 1 ≤t≤T,|W(t)\n1[i, j]| ≤w,\n|W(t)\n2[i, j]| ≤w,|W3[i, j]| ≤wand|W4[i, j]| ≤w, i.e., the maximum absolute value of the ( i, j)\ncoordinates for all the weight matrices are bounded by a non-negative constant w. In addition, we\nalso assume that input log-likelihoo\nrices are bounded by a non-negative constant w. In addition, we\nalso assume that input log-likelihood ratio |λ[i]| ≤bλfor all i= 1, . . . , n .\nWe define the hypothesis class FL,T, derived from the class FTof NBP decoders as follows:\nFL,T={(λ,x)7→lBER(f(λ),x) :f∈ FT}. (8)\nIntuitively, for each f∈ F T, the output of the corresponding function in FL,Tis the BER loss of\nthe decoder f. We next define the empirical Rademacher complexity of FL,T.\nDefinition 1. (Rademacher complexity of FL,T) The empirical Rademacher complexity of FL,Tis\ndefined as\nRm(FL,T)≜E\nσ\"\nsup\nf∈FT1\nmmX\ni=1σilBER(f(λi),xi)#\n, (9)\n7where σi’s are i.i.d. Rademacher random variables, i.e., Pr(σi= 1) = Pr( σi=−1) =1\n2.\nWe note that the loss function lBERtakes the values between [0 ,1]; and consequently using a\nstandard result from PAC learning literature (Theorem 3.3 in [32]), one can bound the generalization\ngap in terms of Rm(FL,T). Specifically, for any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1 −δ, the\ngeneralization gap for any f∈FTis bounded as follows:\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤2Rm(FL,T) +r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m. (10)\nTo proceed further, we introduce bit-wise Rademacher complexity of FT; which is a new notion\nand captures the correlation between j-th channel output of the NBP decoder and a random decision\n(Rademacher random variable).\nDefinition 2. (Bit-wise Rademacher complexity of FT) For a NBP decoder class FT, the empirical\nbit-wise Rademacher complexity corresponding to its j-th output bit is defined as:\nRm(FT[j])≜E\nσ\"\nsup\nf∈FT1\nmmX\ni=1σi·f(λi)[j]#\n. (11)\nWe next present Proposition 1 in which we upper bound the generalization gap as a function of\nthe empirical bit-wise Rademacher complexity Rm(FT[j]).\nProposition 1. For any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1−δ, the generalization gap for any\nNBP decoder f∈ FTcan be upper bounded as follows,\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤1\nnnX\nj=1Rm(FT[j]) +r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m, (12)\nwhere Rm(FT[j])denotes the bit-wise Rademacher complexity for the jth output bit.\nThe proof of Proposition 1 is present\ntes the bit-wise Rademacher complexity for the jth output bit.\nThe proof of Proposition 1 is presented in Appendix A. We now present Theorem 1 which is\nthe main result of this paper. The main technical challenge is to bound the bit-wise Rademacher\ncomplexity Rm(FT[j]) as a function of the number of decoding iterations T, training dataset size\nmand code parameters (blocklength nand variable node degree dv).\nTheorem 1. For any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1−δ, the generalization gap for any NBP\ndecoder f∈ FTcan be upper bounded as follows,\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤4\nm+r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m+ 12r\n(nd2vT+ 1)( T+ 1)\nmlog\u0000\n8√mnwd vbλ\u0001\n, (13)\nwhere ndenotes the blocklength, dvis the variable node degree, Tis the number of decoding iterations\n(number of layers in NBP), mis the training dataset size; wandbλare upper bounds on the weights\nin the NBP decoder and input log-likelihood ratio, respectively.\n8Proof-sketch of Theorem 1: The detailed proof of Theorem 1 is presented in Appendix B and\nhere we briefly describe the main ideas. We first upper bound the bit-wise Rademacher complexity\nin terms of Dudley entropy integral (specifically, leveraging Massart’s Lemma in [39] and adapting\nit to our problem). The resulting bound is expressed in terms of the covering number of the NBP\ndecoder class, i.e., the smallest cardinality of the set of functions in FTthat can closely approximate\nthe NBP decoding function f. To further bound the covering number, we first show that the NBP\ndecoder is Lipschitz in its weight matrices which is proved in Lemma 1 (see Appendix B). In other\nwords, for a given input, the output of the NBP decoder remains invariant to small perturbations\nin its weight matrices. Using this fact, we obtain a bound on the covering number of the NBP\ndecoder class in terms of a product of covering numbers (each corresponding to a weight matrix).\nWe then observe that the weight matrices for the NBP decoder are sparse, where the structure and\nnumber of non-zero entries is determined b\ns for the NBP decoder are sparse, where the structure and\nnumber of non-zero entries is determined by the parity check matrix and the code parameters (such\nas blocklength n, variable node degree dvetc.). We then use the fact that the covering number of\na sparse weight matrix is always smaller than that of a non-sparse vector (of the same size as the\ntotal non-zero entries in the original sparse matrix). Using our result in Lemma 3, we can finally\nupper bound the bit-wise Rademacher complexity as a function of the code parameters to deduce\nthe result in Theorem 1.\nRemark 1 (Representation in Terms of Code-rate and Parity Check Node Degree ).\nThe result in Theorem 1 can also be expressed as follows:\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤4\nm+r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m+12r\n(nd2c(1−κ)2T+ 1)( T+ 1)\nmlog\u0000\n8√mnwd vbλ\u0001\n.(14)\nWe use the fact that the blocklength, message length, variable node degree, and parity check node\ndegree are related as ndv= (n−k)dc. Using this relation in Theorem 1 we obtain (14). From the\nresult in (14) we note that the generalization gap reduces for codes with a high code-rate κ.\nRemark 2 (Impact of the Code-parameters ).We plot the generalization gap bound obtained\nin Theorem 1 in Fig. 2 for blocklength n= 100 , variable node degree dv= 10, decoding iterations\nT= 10 , and dataset size m= 106. To understand the dependence of the generalization gap on\na parameter, we vary that parameter while keeping the values of the remaining parameters fixed.\nSmaller training dataset size results in overfitting, and therefore corresponds to a larger generaliza-\ntion gap. We observe this in Fig. 2(a), wherein the generalization gap decays as O(1√m). While\nmore decoding iterations (i.e., more hidden layers) are expected to improve decoding performance,\nit can also overfit the training data. Therefore, we expect the generalization gap to increase with the\nnumber of decoding iterations. As seen from Fig. 2(b), we note that the generalization gap of the\nNBP decoder scales linearly as O(T). Our theoreti\n. 2(b), we note that the generalization gap of the\nNBP decoder scales linearly as O(T). Our theoretical result in Theorem 1 tells us that the general-\nization gap scales with the blocklength as O(√n)as shown in Fig. 2(c). However, the generalization\ngap scales linearly with the variable node degree as O(dv)as shown in Fig. 2(d).\nRemark 3 (Comparison with Other Approaches for Bounding the Generalization Gap ).\nVapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension bounds [33, 34], PAC-Bayes analysis [35, 36, 49] are other\n9\u003Clatexit

While VC-dimension approach yields a bound\nindependent of the data distribution, it is found that these bounds are vacuous [35, 53] and scales\nexponentially with the number of parameters of the neural network. To obtain tighter and non\nvacuous generalization bounds, prior works [35,54,55] have proposed the use of PAC-Bayes analysis.\nFor any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1−δ, the generalization gap using PAC-Bayes analysis\nis upper bounded as, RBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤q\nKL(ζ||Γ)+log√m+log(2 /δ)\n2m.The PAC-Bayes prior on\nthe space of neural network\ns, RBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤q\nKL(ζ||Γ)+log√m+log(2 /δ)\n2m.The PAC-Bayes prior on\nthe space of neural network decoders ζis chosen independent of the training data [54,56]. The KL\ndivergence term between the PAC-Bayes prior ζand posterior Γis typically the dominant term in the\nbound for the generalization gap. While the posterior Γachieves minimal empirical risk, and is data-\ndependent; the KL divergence term can be large as the data-independent priors are chosen arbitrarily\ncausing the bound to be vacuous [56]. In [49], the PAC-Bayes framework is utilized to establish an\nupper bound on the generalization gap as a function of the network’s sharpness, where sharpness\nis defined as the change in network output relative to the perturbation of the weight matrices. The\nresulting bound is a function of the spectral and Frobenius norms of the weight matrices, assuming\nthat both the perturbation and the prior are from a Gaussian distribution. Exploring PAC-Bayes\nanalysis for the NBP (Neural Belief Propagation) decoder paradigm, and understanding how the\nbound scales with different priors, is an interesting future direction. PAC-Learning approach used\nin this paper leads to a cleaner analysis (inspired by recent results on generalization bounds for\ngraph neural networks and recurrent neural networks [57,58]), and the bound obtained has a closed-\nform expression with explicit dependence on code parameters, decoding iterations, and the training\ndataset size.\nWe next show that Theorem 1 can be readily generalized to irregular parity check matrices. Specif-\n10ically, consider an irregular parity check matrix H∈ {0,1}(n−k)×nwhere dviis the variable node\ndegree of the i-th bit in the codeword, and dcjis the parity check node degree of the j-th parity\ncheck equation. The NBP decoder corresponding to such this irregular parity check matrix is char-\nacterized by the weight matrices {W(t)\n1|1≤t≤T},{W(t)\n2|1≤t≤T},W3,W4. Here, for every\n1≤t≤T, and θ=nP\ni=1dvi, we have that W(t)\n1∈Rθ×n,W(t)\n2∈Rθ×θ\n},{W(t)\n2|1≤t≤T},W3,W4. Here, for every\n1≤t≤T, and θ=nP\ni=1dvi, we have that W(t)\n1∈Rθ×n,W(t)\n2∈Rθ×θ,W3∈Rn×θ, and W4∈Rn×n.\nFor any value of t, the weight matrix W(t)\n1has one non-zero entry in every row, and dvinon-zero\nentries in the i-th column. In the weight matrix W(t)\n2, the i-th bit in the codeword with variable\nnode degree dvicorresponds to dvirows and dvicolumns, and these rows and columns each have\nexactly dvi−1 non-zero entries.\nTheorem 2. For any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1−δ, the generalization gap for any NBP\ndecoder f∈ FTcorresponding to irregular parity check matrix can be upper bounded as follows,\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤4\nm+r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m+ 12vuuutnP\nj=1d2vj(T+ 1)2\nmlog\u0012\n8√mnw max\nidvibλ\u0013\n.(15)\nThe proof of Theorem 2 follows similar steps used to prove Theorem 1, and is presented in Appendix\nE.\nIn Theorem 1, we assumed that the log-likelihood ratios are bounded and this result does not take\nthe channel SNR into account. We study the impact of the bound on input log-likelihood ratios\nand the channel SNR in Theorem 3 which is presented next.\nTheorem 3. For any δ∈(0,1), with probability at least 1−δ, the generalization gap for any NBP\ndecoder f∈ FTwith unbounded log-likelihood ratios is upper bounded as follows,\nRBER(f)−ˆRBER(f)≤min\nbλϕ(n, dv, T, m, w, b λ) +4\nm+r\nlog(1/δ)\n2m. (16)\nwhere, ϕ(n, dv, T, m, w, b λ) = 12q\n(nd2vT+1)(T+1)\nmlog (8√mnwd vbλ)+Pr ( ∃i∈[n],s.t.|λ[i]|\u003E bλ). Sup-\npose the symbols are modulated using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation, and the channel\nis AWGN with variance β2, then Pr (∃i∈[n]s.t.|λ[i]|\u003E bλ) =\u0010\n1−Q\u0010\nβ2bλ+2\n2β\u0011\n−Q\u0010\nβ2bλ−2\n2β\u0011\u0011n\n.\nThe proof of Theorem 3 is presented in Appendix F. To take the unbounded input log-likelihood\nratio into account for analysis, we use the law of total expectations, and condition the true risk\nwith the event that the input log-likelihood ratio is not bounded, i.e., |λ[i]|\u003E bλfor any i∈[n].\nWe bound the probability that log-likelihood ratio is unbounded assuming BPSK modulation, and\nAW\nn].\nWe bound the probability that log-likelihood ratio is unbounded assuming BPSK modulation, and\nAWGN channel. In addition, we have the true risk conditioned on the event that the input log-\nlikelihood ratio is bounded which directly follows from Theorem 1 in this paper. In (16), the term\n12q\n(nd2vT+1)(T+1)\nmlog (8√mnwd vbλ) is an increasing function of bλ, and Pr ( ∃i∈[n],s.t.|λ[i]|\u003E bλ)\n11is a decreasing function of bλ. Therefore, minimizing the two terms over bλprovides the upper\nbound on the generalization gap.\nRemark 4 (Minimizing the generalization gap by selecting the bound on LLR ( bλ)\nbased on Channel SNR ).The generalization gap in Theorem 3 comprises of two terms: (a)\n12q\n(nd2vT+1)(T+1)\nmlog (8√mnwd vbλ), which increases with bλ; (b) Pr (∃i∈[n],s.t.|λ[i]|\u003E bλ), which\nis a decreasing function of bλ,β. The choice of bλto minimize the total generalization gap is a\nfunction of β. To illustrate this, we plot the generalization gap bound obtained in Theorem 3, the\ngeneralization gap bound obtained in Theorem 1 for bounded input LLR, and the probability that the\ninput LLR is unbounded in Fig. 3(a). We set blocklength n= 100 , variable node degree dv= 10 ,\ndecoding iterations T= 10, and dataset size m= 106. As seen in Fig. 3(a), the generalization gap\nterms obtained in Theorem 1 are minimized in region R1 that corresponds to smaller values of β(or\nlarge channel SNR). This behavior is attributed to lower values of bλ(i.e., bλ= 10) as observed in\nFig. 3(b). As the βis increased (or reducing the channel SNR) in region R2 in Fig. 3(a), the min-\nimum generalization gap is obtained for larger values of bλ. The term Pr (∃i∈[n],s.t.|λ[i]|\u003E bλ)\nalso decreases with increase in β(or lower channel SNR values). In other words, there is a trade-off\nbetween the terms 12q\n(nd2vT+1)(T+1)\nmlog (8√mnwd vbλ), and Pr (∃i∈[n],s.t.|λ[i]|\u003E bλ)based on the\nchannel SNR. We adopt this approach to establish a dependency on the channel SNR, considering\nthat our method for bounding the gener\nach to establish a dependency on the channel SNR, considering\nthat our method for bounding the generalization gap was previously data-independent. In contrast,\ndata-dependent bounds create a direct link between the generalization gap and the mutual infor-\nmation involving the input dataset and the algorithm output [42, 43]. This methodology implicitly\naccounts for various factors, including the dataset, hypothesis set, learning algorithm, and the loss\nfunction employed. Consequently, the integration of mutual information-based approaches could be\ncrucial in demonstrating a direct correlation between the generalization gap and the channel SNR.\n4 Experimental Results\nIn this section, we present some numerical results to complement our theoretical bounds. We\nconsider binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation and AWGN channel, and the received\nchannel output for 1 ≤i≤nis given as y[i] = (−1)x[i]+z[i]. We focus on Tanner codes with:\n(i)n= 155, k= 64, dv= 3, dc= 5; (ii) n= 310, k= 128, dv= 3, dc= 5 and study the\nempirical generalization performance of NBP decoders whose architecture was proposed in [5], and\nalso described in Section 2 of this paper. We adopt the software provided with the papers [6, 7]\nfor our experiments. We train the weights of the NBP decoder until convergence by minimizing\nthe cross-entropy loss between the true and the predicted codeword. We use ADAM optimizer for\ntraining with a learning rate of 0 .01. We evaluate the NBP decoder by measuring the generalization\ngap (difference between average BER attained on the test and training datasets). We perform each\nexperiment for 10 trials, and the distribution of the generalization gap over these 10 randomized\nruns are plotted on a boxplot. We next discuss the impact of the dataset size ( m), and the decoding\niterations ( T) on the generalization gap.\n120.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91-0.200.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.8\u003Clatexit

From the results in Fig. 4(a), (b), we observe that\nthe generalization gap is the largest for m= 1000, and generally decays with m. For a smaller\ndataset size, the overfitting on the training samples is severe. Therefore, the NBP decoder fails to\ngeneralize on unseen sa\ntting on the training samples is severe. Therefore, the NBP decoder fails to\ngeneralize on unseen samples in the test data. We also repeated the above experiment for various\nvalues of Tas well as by changing SNR. We found the inverse monotonic dependence on mto be\nconsistent across different values of Tand SNR (plots are omitted due to lack of space).\nb.

Here, we fixed channel SNR of 2 dB, training dataset size m= 104and varied\nTfrom{2,3, . . . , 10}. As seen in Fig. 5 the generalization gap grows linearly with T, which is\nconsistent with Theorem 1 (which behaves as O(T)). Increasing the number of parameters will\ncause overfitting of the NBP decoder resulting in a larger generalization gap. We note that this\nobservation (i.e., linear dependence on T) was consistent for different dataset sizes, and channel\nSNR values.\nc. Impact of standard deviation of the Gaussian noise ( β):In this experiment, we examine\nthe effects of varying the standard deviation of Gaussian noise, represented by β, on the general-\nization gap of NBP decoders. We consider NBP decoders with T= 3 iterations and trained on a\ndataset of size m= 104. According to the results depicted in Fig. 6(a) and (b), we observe that\nthe generalization gap exhibits non-monotonic behavior in relation to β. Specifically, for β≤1,\nthere is an increase in the generalization gap. Conversely, for β≥1, the generalization gap begins\nto decrease. When βis substantially large, the channel output becomes statistically independent\nof the input due to the increased channel noise. Consequently, this results in higher training and\ntest BER, which in turn leads to a reduced generalization gap.\nd.

7: Generalization gap as a function of the blocklength nat channel SNR = 2 dB for parent\nQC-LDPC codes with (a) n= 1000, and k= 500, (b) n= 680, and k= 340. The descendent codes\nwith shorter blocklengths are derived by masking columns of parity check matrix in pare\nendent codes\nwith shorter blocklengths are derived by masking columns of parity check matrix in parent code.\ndegree fixed, we use Progressive Edge-Growth (PEG) algorithm [59, 60] to construct two quasi-\ncyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) parity check matrices with: (i) n= 680, k= 340, dv= 3, dc= 6; (ii)\nn= 1000, k= 500, dv= 3, dc= 7. We use the two codes as the parent code, and derive the\nparity check matrices for varying blocklengths keeping the variable node degree fixed by masking\nthe columns of the parity-check matrix of the parent codes. Specifically, in Fig. 7 (a) we consider\ncodes with blocklengths n= 425, 510, 595 derived from QC-LDPC parity check matrix with\nn= 680, k= 340; and in Fig. 7 (b) we consider codes with blocklengths n= 600, 700, 800, 900\nderived from QC-LDPC parity check matrix with n= 1000, k= 500. We note that in addition to\nthe blocklength, the descendent codes have different code-rates than the parent QC-LDPC code.\nHowever, this method allows us to generate descendent codes that have the same structure (or same\nnature) as that of the parent code, thereby, eliminating the impact of varying code structures on\nthe generalization gap. To account for the different training bit-errors for codes with varying code\nrates, we normalize the generalization gap with the training bit-error-rate (or the empirical risk).\nWe also plot the theoretical bound derived in Theorem 1 normalized with the training bit-error-\nrate (i.e., 12q\n(nd2vT+1)(T+1)\nmlog (8√mnwd vbλ)/ˆRBER(f)). We consider NBP decoder with T= 3\ndecoding iterations trained for channel SNR of 2 dB using dataset whose size m= 104. As seen in\nFig. 7 the generalization gap grows with n, which is consistent with Theorem 1. The implication\nof this result is that for a fixed set of parity check equations, the decoding complexity increases\nwith the blocklength; and the generalization gap is expected to increase with the blocklength for\nthe codes with same structure.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this work, we presented results on\ne blocklength for\nthe codes with same structure.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this work, we presented results on the generalization gap of NBP decoders as a function of train-\ning dataset size, decoding iterations and code parameters (such as blocklength, message length,\nvariable node degree, and parity check node degree). We utilize the PAC-learning theory to express\nthe generalization gap as a function of the Rademacher complexity of class of NBP decoders. The\n15sparse connections in the NBP decoder architecture plays a critical role in further upper bound-\ning the Rademacher complexity term as a function of the code parameters. Our bounds exhibit\nmild polynomial dependence on the blocklength nand the decoding iterations (layers) T. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide theoretical guarantees for NBP decoders\ncorresponding to both regular and irregular parity check matrices. We also present generalizations\nof our theoretical result to account for different channel characteristics. We also presented com-\nprehensive set of experiments using Tanner codes and Quasi-cyclic LDPC codes to evaluate our\ntheoretical bounds in this paper. In our empirical results, we observe that the generalization gap\nincreases linearly with the decoding iterations, and grows with the blocklength. In addition, we\nobserve that the generalization gap decays with the training dataset size, thereby supporting the\ntheoretical results in this paper. There are several interesting directions for future work, including\na) obtaining generalization gap bounds for NBP decoders when the decoder is trained and tested\nover a range of SNR values; b) obtaining generalization bounds for ML based decoders with prac-\ntical constraints (such as quantized weights); c) extending the ideas for other type of ML based\ncodes/decoders (i.e., beyond BP type decoder architectures); d) a framework to select the code\nparameters (i.e., blocklength and variable node degree pairs) that minimize the generalizatio\ne code\nparameters (i.e., blocklength and variable node degree pairs) that minimize the generalization gap\nfor a given channel SNR is also an important research direction.\nReferences\n[1] S.

(17)\nwhere, in step (a), we consider the mapping such that xi[j]∈ {− 1,1}, and f(λi[j])∈ {− 1,1}; and\nin step (b), we express the Hamming distance dH(f(λi),xi) =1\nnPn\nj=1(1−f(λi)[j]×xi[j]). In\nwhat follows, we take the supremum over FTinside the summation. We note that the distribution\nof−σixi[j] and σiis the same, and we obtain:\nRm(FL,T)≤1\n2E\nσ\nnX\nj=1sup\nf∈FT1\nmnmX\ni=1(−f(λi)[j]·(σi·xi[j]))\n\n=1\n2nnX\nj=1E\nσ\"\nsup\nf∈FT1\nmmX\ni=1σi·f(λi)[j]#\n=1\n2nnX\nj=1Rm(FT[j]). (18)\nIn (18), the last step follows from the Definition 2.\nAppendix B Proof of Theorem 1\nIn this appendix, we present the proof of Theorem 1. We first define the covering number and\npacking number of FTwhich is the set of all NBP decoders with Tdecoding iterations.\nDefinition 3. (Covering Number) The covering number N(FT, ϵ,∥ · ∥ k)of the set FTwith\n21respect to the k-th norm for ϵ \u003E0is defined as\nN(FT, ϵ,∥ · ∥ k) = min\nn|{g1,···, gn}|, (19)\ns.t.min\n1≤i≤n∥f(λ)−gi(λ)∥k≤ϵ. (20)\n(20)must be satisfied for any f∈ FTand input log likelihood ratio λ; then the set {g1,···, gn} ⊆ F T\nis the ϵ-cover of FT.\nDefinition 4. (Packing number) For a set of NBP decoders FT, its packing number M(FT, ϵ,∥·\n∥k)with respect to the k-th norm for ϵ \u003E0is defined as\nM(FT, ϵ,∥ · ∥ k) = max\nn|{g1,···, gn}|, (21)\ns.t.∥gi(λ)−gj(λ)∥k\u003E ϵ. (22)\n(22) must be satisfied for any gi, gj∈ {g1,···, gn}; and the set P(FT, ϵ,∥·∥k) ={g1,···, gn} ⊂ F T\nthat satisfies (21),(22) is called the ϵ-packing of FT.\nFrom Proposition 1, we have that, RBER(f)≤ˆRBER(f) +1\n2nPn\nj=1Rm(FT[j\nis called the ϵ-packing of FT.\nFrom Proposition 1, we have that, RBER(f)≤ˆRBER(f) +1\n2nPn\nj=1Rm(FT[j]) +q\nlog(1/δ)\n2m. Next,\nwe use a PAC-Learning approach to bound the bit-wise Rademacher complexity term Rm(FT[j])\nas a function of m, and spectral norm of the weight matrices of the NBP decoder. We use similar\nreasoning to that used in generalization bound results for graph neural networks and recurrent\nneural networks in [57,58]; and we can adopt Lemma A.5. in [39] to bound the bit-wise Rademacher\ncomplexity as:\nRm(FT[j])≤inf\nα\u003E0\n4α√m+12\nm√mZ\nαp\nlogN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)dϵ\n. (23)\nTo further upper bound the bit-wise Rademacher complexity, we make use of the upper bounds\non the spectral norm of the weight matrices. Recall our assumption made in Section 3 that the\nmaximum absolute value of the non-zero entries in the weight matrices are bounded by a non-\nnegative constant w. In addition, we also use the result in [61] that the spectral norm of any\nmatrix Acan be upper bounded as a function of its maximum absolute column sum norm ∥A∥1,\nand maximum absolute row sum norm ∥A∥∞as∥A∥2≤p\n∥A∥∞∥A∥1. Using the assumption and\nthe result in [61], the spectral norm of the weight matrices W(t)\n1,W(t)\n2for any 1 ≤t≤Tcan be\nupper bounded as:\nBW1=∥W(t)\n1∥2≤wp\ndv,\nBW2=∥W(t)\n2∥2≤w(dv−1). (24)\n22Similarly, we obtain the L2norm bounds on for any j−th row vector in matrices W3andW4as:\nBw3=∥W3[j,:]∥2≤wp\ndv,\nBw4=∥W4[j,:]∥2≤w. (25)\nWe use these spectral norm bounds in Lemma 1 in which we show that the NBP decoder is Lipschitz\ncontinuous with respect to its weight matrices. That is, for the j-th bit we have,\n\r\rf(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]\r\r\n2≤TX\ni=1ρ\nW(i)\n1\r\r\rW(i)\n1−W′(i)\n1\r\r\r\n2+TX\ni=2ρ\nW(i)\n2\r\r\rW(i)\n2−W′(i)\n2\r\r\r\n2\n+ρw3\r\rW3[j,:]−W′\n3[j,:]\r\r\n2+ρw4\r\rW4[j,:]−W′\n4[j,:]\r\r\n2. (26)\nIn (26), ρW1,ρW2,ρw3,ρw4are Lipschitz parameters that is a function of the spectral norm bounds\nof the weight matrices, the L2norm bound of input λ, and are given as,\nρ\nW(i)\n1=nbλBw3\u0000√nBW2\u0001T−i,\nρ\nW(i)\n2=nTb λBW1Bw3(√nBW2)T−1−1√nBW2−\nound of input λ, and are given as,\nρ\nW(i)\n1=nbλBw3\u0000√nBW2\u0001T−i,\nρ\nW(i)\n2=nTb λBW1Bw3(√nBW2)T−1−1√nBW2−1+nbλBW1Bw3(BW2)T−2(√n)T−1−1√n−1,\nρw3=√nBW1bλ \n(BW2)T−1−1\nBW2−1+ (BW2)T−1!\n,\nρw4=bλ. (27)\nAs a result of (26), the covering number N(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥2) in (23) can be upper bounded using the\ncovering number of all distinct weight matrices as follows,\nN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤TY\ni=1N(W(i)\n1,ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρ\nW(i)\n1,∥ · ∥ F)×TY\ni=2N(W(i)\n2,ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρ\nW(i)\n2,∥ · ∥ F)\n× N(W3[j,:],ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρw3,∥ · ∥ F)× N(W4[j,:],ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρw4,∥ · ∥ F) (28)\nWe now upper bound the covering number of the set of decoders FTin (28) using Lemma 3, in\nwhich we derive an upper bound on the covering number of sparse matrices as a function of the\nnumber of rows, columns, number of non-zero entries in the sparse matrix, and the spectral norm\nbound.\nBounding N(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2):We know that the matrices W1,W2,W3, and W4have 1, dv−1,\ndv, and 1 non-zero entries in each row, respectively. Using Lemma 3, the covering number of the\n23weight matrices of the NBP decoder ffor 1≤i≤Tcan be bounded as follows:\nN(W(i)\n1,ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρ\nW(i)\n1,∥ · ∥ F)≤\n1 +(4T+ 2)√nBW1ρ\nW(i)\n1\nϵ\nndv\nN(W(i)\n2,ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρ\nW(i)\n2,∥ · ∥ F)≤\n1 +(4T+ 2)√ndvBW2ρ\nW(i)\n2\nϵ\n(dv−1)ndv\nN(W3[j,:],ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρw3,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +(4T+ 2)Bw3ρw3\nϵ\u0013dv\nN(W4[j,:],ϵ\n(2T+ 1)ρw4,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +(4T+ 2)Bw4ρw4\nϵ\u0013\n(29)\nSubstituting (29) in (28), we obtain,\nN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤TY\ni=1\n1+(4T+ 2)√nBW1ρ\nW(i)\n1\nϵ\nndv\n×TY\ni=2\n1 +(4T+ 2)√ndvBW2ρ\nW(i)\n2\nϵ\n(dv−1)ndv\n×\u0012\n1 +(4T+ 2)Bw3ρw3\nϵ\u0013dv\n×\u0012\n1 +(4T+ 2)Bw4ρw4\nϵ\u0013\n.

(35)\nProof. For outputs f(λ) and f′(λ), respectively we consider the following parameter sets: (a)\nW(1)\n1,···,W(T)\n1,W(1)\n2,···,W(T)\n2,W3,W4, and (b) W′(1)\n1,···,W′(T)\n1,W′(1)\n2,···,W′(T)\n2,W′\n3,W′\n4.\nFor the j-th output in the NBP decoder, we have that,\n∥f(λ)[j]−f′(λ)[j]\r\r\n2=\r\rs(W4[j,:]λ[j] +W3[j,:]pT)−s\u0000\nW′\n4[j,:]λ[j] +W′\n3[j,:]p′\nT\u0001\r\r\n2\n≤\r\r\u0000\nW4[j,:]−W′\n4[j,:]\u0001\nλ[j] +W3[j,:]pT−W′\n3[j,:]pT+W′\n3[j,:]pT−W′\n3[j,:]p′\nT\r\r\n2\n≤\r\r\u0000\nW4[j,:]−W′\n4[j,:]\u0001\nλ[j]\r\r\n2+\r\r\u0000\nW3[j,:]−W′\n3[j,:]\u0001\npT\r\r\n2+\r\rW′\n3[j,:]\u0000\npT−p′\nT\u0001\r\r\n2\n≤\r\rW4[j,:]−W′\n4[j,:]\r\r\n2bλ+∥pT∥2\r\rW3[j,:]−W′\n3[j,:]\r\r\n2+Bw3\r\rpT−p′\nT\r\r\n2.

To further upper bound ∥pT∥2, we know from Lemma 2 that\n25∥pT∥2≤ ∥vT∥2, and therefore we have\n∥pT∥2≤ ∥vT∥2=\r\r\rW(T)\n1λ+W(T)\n2pT−1\r\r\r\n2\n≤\r\r\rW(T)\n1λ\r\r\r\n2+\r\r\rW(T)\n2pT−1\r\r\r\n2\n≤√nBW1bλ+BW2∥pT−1∥2.

(48)\nThis completes the proof of Lemma 1.\nNext, we state and prove Lemma 2 in which we show that for any layer t, the value of ∥pt∥2is less\nthan∥vt∥2. This inequality was used to obtain the result in Lemma 1.\nLemma 2. Given the output of the parity check layer ptdefined by the min-sum operation as:\npt[{l, m}] =Y\nl′∈P(m)\\lsign(vt[{l′, m}]) min\nl′∈P(m)\\l|vt[{l′, m}]| (49)\nThen, the norm ∥pt∥2is always bounded by the norm ∥vt∥2, i.e., ∥pt∥2≤ ∥vt∥2.\nProof. It is straightforward to verify that for any decoding iteration the norm of output of parity\ncheck layer is always lower than the variable node layer. For nlength code and klength message,\nlet us consider parity check matrix H∈ {0,1}n×(n−k)with variable node degree dv, and parity\ncheck node degree dc.\nWe denote the corresponding Tanner graph as G ∈ {V ,P,E}, where V={v1, . . . , v n},P=\n{p1, . . . , p n−k}, and E={e1, . . . , e ndv}. Without loss of generality, let us consider parity check\nnode p1inGsuch that P(p1) ={v1, v2, . . . , v dc}, where {v1, v2, . . . , v dc} ⊆ V . Therefore, in the\nTanner graph, dcis the number of incoming messages to p1; which translates to dchidden nodes in\nthe variable check layer vtfor any 1 ≤t≤Tin the NBP decoder (whose architecture was described\nin Section 3). Similarly, dcis the number of outgoing messages from p1; this translates to dchidden\nnodes\nction 3). Similarly, dcis the number of outgoing messages from p1; this translates to dchidden\nnodes in the parity check layer ptin the NBP decoder.\nThe message passed pt[{1,1}] from p1tov1in the NBP decoder is given as,\npt[{1,1}] =Y\nl′∈P(p1)\\v1sign(vt[{l′,1}]) min\nl′∈P(p1)\\v1|vt[{l′,1}]|\n=sign(vt[{2,1}])·sign(vt[{3,1}])···sign(vt[{dc,1}])\n×min (|vt[{2,1}]|,|vt[{3,1}]|,···,|vt[{dc,1}]|)\n(a)=sign(vt[{2,1}])·sign(vt[{3,1}])···sign(vt[{dc,1}])× |vt[{2,1}]|. (50)\nwhere, step (a) follows from our assumption that |vt[{1,1}]|\u003C|vt[{2,1}]|···\u003C|vt[{dc,1}]|, without\n28loss of generality. Following similar steps as in (50), for the set {vi|2≤i≤dc}, we have that,\npt[{i,1}] =Y\nl′∈P(p1)\\visign(vt[{l′,1}])× |vt[{1,1}]| (51)\nThis implies that outputs of dc−1 nodes in ptcorrespond to the minimum absolute value of the\ndcincoming messages to p1. Therefore, for the parity check equation p1, we have,\n dcX\ni=1|pt[{i,1}]|2!1\n2\n≤\u0000\n(dc−1)|vt[{1,1}]|2+|vt[{2,1}]|2\u00011\n2. (52)\nFollowing similar steps for parity checks p2,···pn−k, we can conclude that,\n∥pt∥2≤ ∥vt∥2, (53)\nwhere, equality in (53) is satisfied when the output of the hidden nodes in vthave same absolute\nvalues. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.\nAppendix D Bound on covering number of sparse matrices\nIn this section, we derive an upper bound on the covering number of sparse matrices as a function\nof its rows, columns, and spectral norm bound.\nLemma 3. LetW={W∈Rr×c:∥W∥2≤BWand∥W[i,:]∥0=q,1≤i≤r}be the space of\nmatrices with its spectral norm bounded by a constant BW, and exactly qnon-zero entries in each\nrow. Then, its covering number N(W, ϵ,∥ · ∥ F)with respect to the Frobenius norm can be upper\nbounded as follows:\nN(W, ϵ,∥ · ∥ F)≤\u0012\n1 +2 min (√r,√c)BW\nϵ\u0013qr\n. (54)\nwhere, ϵ \u003E0is a constant.\nProof. We consider Ψ : Rr×c→Rqr×1, a bijective mapping such that Ψ( W)∈Rqr×1is a vector of\nall non-zero entries in W∈ W. The vector space induced by the mapping Ψ is defined as ψsuch\nthatψ(W) ={Ψ(W) :W∈ W} . Therefore, we also have ∥W∥F=∥Ψ(W)∥2.\nWe c\nhe mapping Ψ is defined as ψsuch\nthatψ(W) ={Ψ(W) :W∈ W} . Therefore, we also have ∥W∥F=∥Ψ(W)∥2.\nWe construct C(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2), aϵ-covering of ψ(W) under the L2norm, and denote the corre-\nsponding covering number by N(ψ(W), ϵ,∥·∥2). Similarly, we construct C(W, ϵ,∥·∥F), aϵ-covering\nofWunder ∥·∥F, and its covering number is denoted as N(W, ϵ,∥·∥F). In what follows, we have,\nN(W, ϵ,∥ · ∥ F)(a)\n≤ N(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)(b)\n≤ M (ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2). (55)\nThe inequality (a) in (55) follows from the fact that Ψ is a bijective map, and that Ψ−1C(ψ(W), ϵ,∥·\n∥2) is also a ϵ-cover of the matrices in W. The inequality (b) in (55) follows from the definition\n29of packing P(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2) and the packing number M(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2). In other words, let\nP(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2) be the maximal packing. Suppose for some Wi∈ W there exists Ψ( U)∈\nW\\P (ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2) such that,\n∥Ψ(Wi)−Ψ(U)∥2≥ϵ. (56)\nThen, P(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2) being a maximal packing is a contradiction. Therefore, P(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)\nis also an ϵ-cover of ψ(W) and it follows that its cardinality (i.e., packing number) denoted by\nM(ψ(W), ϵ,∥·∥2) is greater than N(ψ(W), ϵ,∥·∥2). In the next step, we upper bound M(ψ(W), ϵ,∥·\n∥2). To this end, we make use of the definitions 3, 4 to determine this upper bound; and it follows\nfrom these definitions that the balls need not be disjoint for an ϵ-cover C(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2), and it\nmust be disjoint for ϵ-packing P(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2). Therefore, ∀wi∈ P(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2) we have that,\nP(ψ(W),ϵ,∥·∥2)[\ni=1B(wi,ϵ\n2)⊂ B(0, R+ϵ\n2). (57)\nwhere, the radius R= max\nW∈W∥Ψ(W)∥2. Taking volume on both sides in (57), we have that,\nvol\nP(ψ(W),ϵ,∥·∥2)[\ni=1B(wi,ϵ\n2)\n≤vol\u0010\nB(0, R+ϵ\n2)\u0011\n=⇒P(ψ(W),ϵ,∥·∥2)X\ni=1vol\u0010\nB(wi,ϵ\n2)\u0011\n≤vol\u0010\nB(0, R+ϵ\n2)\u0011\n. (58)\nTo find the value of the radius R, we bound the L2norm of Ψ( W) in terms of the spectral norm\nof the sparse matrix W, and we have that,\n∥Ψ(W)∥2=∥W∥F≤min (√r,√c)∥W∥2≤min (√r,√c)BW. (59)\nBy considering the L2ballB(0, R), where radius R= min (√r,√c)BW, and from (58) we ob\n(√r,√c)BW. (59)\nBy considering the L2ballB(0, R), where radius R= min (√r,√c)BW, and from (58) we obtain\nan upper bound on M(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2) as follows,\nM(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0000\nR+ϵ\n2\u0001qr\n\u0000ϵ\n2\u0001qr≤\u0012\n1 +2 min (√r,√c)BW\nϵ\u0013qr\n. (60)\nTherefore, we have,\nN(W, ϵ,∥ · ∥ F)≤M(ψ(W), ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤\u0012\n1 +2 min (√r,√c)BW\nϵ\u0013qr\n. (61)\nThis completes the proof of Lemma 3.\n30Appendix E Proof of Theorem 2\nWe consider an irregular parity check matrix H∈R(n−k)×nwhere dviis the variable node degree of\nthei-th bit in the codeword, and dcjis the parity check node degree of the j-th parity check equation.\nThe NBP decoder corresponding to such this irregular parity check matrix is characterized by the\nweight matrices W(1)\n1,W(2)\n1,···,W(T)\n1,W(2)\n2,W(2)\n2,···,W(T)\n2,W3,W4.\nHere, for t∈ {1,···, T}, and θ=nP\ni=1dvi, we have that W(t)\n1∈Rθ×n,W(t)\n2∈Rθ×θ,W3∈Rn×θ,\nandW4∈Rn×n. For any value of t, the weight matrix W(t)\n1has one non-zero entry in every row,\nanddvinon-zero entries in the i-th column for integer values i∈[n]. In the weight matrix W(t)\n2,\nthei-th bit in the codeword with variable node degree dvicorresponds to dvirows and dvicolumns,\nand these rows and columns each have exactly dvi−1 non-zero entries.\nThei-th row in the weight matrix W3corresponds to the i-th bit in the codeword, and has exactly\ndvinon-zero entries. Lastly, the weight matrix W4∈Rn×nis a a diagonal matrix. If the weights\nin the NBP decoder are bounded in [ −w, w], then for any t∈ {1,2,···, T}, the spectral norm of\nthe weight matrices W(t)\n1, and W(t)\n2can be bounded as follows:\nBW1=∥W(t)\n1∥2≤wq\nmax\nidvi, B W2=∥W(t)\n2∥2≤w\u0012\nmax\nidvi−1\u0013\n(62)\nTheL2norm bounds on the row vector in matrices W3andW4are as follows:\nBw3=∥W3[j,:]∥2≤wq\ndvj≤wq\nmax\nidvi, B w4=∥W4[j,:]∥2≤w (63)\nFor irregular parity check matrices, the upper bound (30) becomes,\nN(FT[j], ϵ,∥ · ∥ 2)≤TY\ni=1\n1 +(4T+ 2)√nBW1ρ\nW(i)\n1\nϵ\nnP\nh=1dvh\n×TY\ni=2\n1 +(4T+ 2)√ndvBW2ρ\nW(i)\n2\nϵ\nnP\nh=1(dvh−1)dvh\n×\u0012\n1 +(4T+ 2)Bw3ρw3\nϵ\u0013max\nhdvh\n×\u0012\n1 +(4T+ 2)Bw4ρw4\nϵ\u0013\n.

Analogous to classical computer networks, quantum networks allow for the\ndistribution of quantum operations among quantum processors. In this work, we describe a Quantum\nWalk Control Protocol (QWCP) to perform distributed quantum operations in a quantum network.\nWe consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the\ninteraction between quantum walks in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network\nnodes. QWCP allows for the implementation of networked quantum services, such as distributed quantum\ncomputing and entanglement distribution, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of\nquantum information through channels. Multiple interacting quantum walks can be used to propagate\nentangled control signals across the network in parallel. We demonstrate how to use QWCP to perform\ndistributed multi-qubit controlled gates, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed\nquantum computing. Furthermore, we apply the QWCP to the task of entanglement distribution in a\nquantum network.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nQuantum networking is an innovative, multidisciplinary field of research that promises revo-\nlutionary improvements in communications, enabling tasks and applications that are impossible\n1A preliminary version of this work was presented at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering\n2021 (QCE21) [1].arXiv:2307.06492v1  [quant-ph]  12 Jul 20232\nto achieve with the exclusive exchange of classical information [2], [3].\n  [quant-ph]  12 Jul 20232\nto achieve with the exclusive exchange of classical information [2], [3]. Similar to a classical\ncomputer network, a quantum network is a distributed system composed of quantum computers\nand quantum repeaters that exchange quantum information across physical channels. Among\napplications supported by quantum networks, Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) is of\nparticular interest as it leverages the power of interconnected quantum computers to create a\nvirtual quantum machine with processing capabilities that surpass its physical constituents alone\n[4]–[6]. DQC is general as it encompasses any distributed architecture for quantum computing,\nfrom the short-range interconnection of multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) inside the\nsame cooling device, to arbitrary-scale quantum data centers [7]. Furthermore, DQC offers a\npractical way to scale quantum computers in the Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum machines\n(NISQ) era [6]. Modular, distributed architectures facilitate the construction of large quantum\nmachines by replacing the complexity of building a monolithic QPU with a large number of\nqubits with that of a machine consisting of an interconnection of simpler QPUs with fewer\nqubits [7]–[9].\nWhen the quantum network scenario is considered, the complexity of distributed quantum\ncomputing extends in at least two dimensions. First, physical quantum channels have a well\nknown depletion effect in the exchange of quantum data, e.g., an exponential decrease in channel\nentanglement rate with distance [10]. Second, there is a demand for a quantum network protocol\ncapable of performing desired distributed quantum operations while accounting for network\nconnectivity. Generic quantum computation with qubits in distinct quantum processors demands\neither the application of remote controlled gates [11] or the continuous exchange of quantum\ninformation. For both cases, a network protocol is necessary to orchestrate the communication\nbetween nodes that ar\nr both cases, a network protocol is necessary to orchestrate the communication\nbetween nodes that are not directly connected with one another.\nOne challenge in the design of a control protocol is the need for it to be agnostic to hardware\nimplementations. There is a plethora of physical systems suited for quantum computation under\ninvestigation, superconducting qubits [12], trapped ions [13], [14] and Silicon-vacancy color\ncenters in diamond [15], [16] to name a few. In addition, there is a diverse investigation in\nthe architectural description of quantum interconnecting devices capable of exchanging quantum\ninformation encoded in distinct quantum physical quantities [17]. This diverse ecosystem of\nquantum network technologies indicates that distributed quantum computing network protocols\nneed to abstract physical implementations of quantum switches and network connectivity while\nmaintaining universality requirements.3\nThe goal of this article is to propose a control protocol for distributed quantum computing\nbased on discrete-time coined quantum walks [18]. Quantum walks are universal for quantum\ncomputing [19]–[21] and have been successfully employed in the quantum network scenario\nto perform perfect state transfer (PST) between network nodes [22], [23], teleportation [24],\n[25] and quantum key distribution (QKD) [26]. Previous works describe ways of distributing\nentanglement between nodes on a quantum network using the coin space of the walker to propel\nentanglement generation between qubits [23], [24]. In addition, the formalism of quantum walks\nwith multiple coins enabled the description of an entanglement routing protocol, which interprets\nqubits within a network node as vertices of an abstract graph used by a quantum walker to\ngenerate entanglement [27]. In spite of their relevance, the quantum walk approaches present in\nthe literature are suited to particular network structures and quantum operations. In particular,\nthey consider the case of regular lattices\nnetwork structures and quantum operations. In particular,\nthey consider the case of regular lattices, describing walker dynamics on regular structures and\ndo not address how the quantum walk can be used to perform generic distributed quantum\noperations. In this context, our work adds to the literature of both quantum walks and quantum\nnetworks with a description of a quantum network control protocol that can be applied to arbitrary\ngraphs and perform universal quantum computing in a quantum network.\nA. Contributions\nThe contributions of this article are three-fold.\n•We propose a Quantum Walk Control Protocol (QWCP) for distributed quantum computing\nin a quantum network. The protocol uses quantum walks to propagate control signals to\nperform quantum operations among physically separated quantum processors. We assume\nthat each processor dedicates part of its internal quantum register to represent walker control\nsignals and describe how the control subsystem interacts with the data subsystem. Data-\ncontrol interaction is specified by unitary operations that nodes need to implement in order\nto realize the quantum walk control plane. We specify operations for the interaction of\nmultiple quantum walks that generates entanglement among quantum control signals and\nallows for distributed execution of complex multi-qubit gates.\n•We apply the QWCP to distribute controlled quantum gates. We show the universality of\nthe protocol by describing how an arbitrary 2-qubit operation between qubits in distinct\nnodes of the network is performed with the quantum walk control plane. The protocol is\nuniversal in the sense that it implements a universal gate set on the Hilbert space formed by4\nall qubits in the data subsystem of the nodes. Furthermore, it is generic in the sense that it\nabstracts hardware implementation and channel transmissions, while being well-defined for\nany network topology. Moreover, we apply the protocol to parallel propagation of quantum\ncontrol signals through mult\nogy. Moreover, we apply the protocol to parallel propagation of quantum\ncontrol signals through multiple network paths and trees.\n•We apply the QWCP to perform entanglement distribution in the data subsystem of the\nnodes.\nWe assume that quantum error correction is provided by the network, such that nodes contain\nsufficient number of qubits to implement the required operations fault tolerantly, and describe\nthe control plane in the setting of noiseless, logical qubits. Throughout the remainder of this\nwork, we refer to noiseless qubits and logical qubits interchangeably.\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section II, we present the system model\nconsidered in this work, together with the mathematical background needed for the description\nof the QWCP. We describe the operations in which the QWCP is built upon in Section III.\nThe quantum operators for the implementation of distributed gates with a quantum walk in the\nnetwork are described in Section IV, where the universality of the protocol is demonstrated. The\nprotocol is applied to perform parallel control propagation with multiple walkers in Section V.\nIn Section VI, we apply the QWCP to realize entanglement distribution. Finally, the manuscript\nis concluded in Section VII.\nII. S YSTEM MODEL\nConsider a symmetric directed graph G= (V, E), with VandErepresenting the nodes and\nthe edges of the graph, respectively. Gbeing symmetric implies that (v, u)∈Eif, and only\nif,(u, v)∈E. Let δ(v)denote the set of neighbors of vertex v∈Vandd(v) =|δ(v)|denote\nthe degree of v. Let ∆p(u, v)denote the hop-distance between uandvthrough a path p∈G,\nand∆(u, v) = min p∆p(u, v)denote the minimum hop-distance between the nodes. Throughout\nthis work we refer to the inverse of a binary string x∈ {0,1}∗asx, e.g., if x= 101 , then\nx= 010 . A quantum network is a set of quantum hosts (quantum processors) interconnected by\na set of quantum channels that allow the exchange of quantum information [3]. A host is either\na quan\n set of quantum channels that allow the exchange of quantum information [3]. A host is either\na quantum repeater, a quantum router, or a quantum computer with a fixed number of qubits,\nwhich performs generic quantum operations. We represent a quantum network as a symmetric\ndirected graph N= (V, E). Each node v∈Vrepresents a quantum host that has a set Nv\nof qubits that are used to exchange quantum information with nodes in its neighborhood δ(v)5\nthrough a set of quantum channels and a set Mvof qubits that can be processed together at\nany time. More precisely, each edge (u, v)∈Erepresents a quantum channel connecting the\nqubits in NuandNvwhich can interact through operations mediated via the channel. We will\nrefer to NvandMvas the networking and data registers of node v, respectively. The sets\nN=S\nvNvandM=S\nvMvare respectively referred to as the network control plane and the\nnetwork data plane . The Hilbert spaces formed by NandMareHNandHM, respectively.\nLetHG=HN⊗ HMdenote the joint Hilbert space spanned by the control and data planes.\nThis network model divides the qubit registers in the nodes into control and data registers.\nSuch separation is not required for distributed quantum computing, although modeling network\ncontrol and data planes separately is useful for the design of a quantum network control plane\nprotocol, as has been shown for the classical case with software defined networks (SDNs) [28].\nThis modular architecture decouples network control and computing operations, and enables the\nprotocol to operate in hardware heterogeneous networks where nodes may use distinct physical\nplatforms for qubits, such as trapped ions or color centers, as long as the control operations are\nimplemented.\nA. Quantum network protocols\nConsider the system formed by two quantum processors uandvconnected by a channel and\ntheir respective qubits. A local operation is a quantum transformation represented as a separable\noperator of the form Ou⊗Ov, where OuandOvacts on the state spa\nsformation represented as a separable\noperator of the form Ou⊗Ov, where OuandOvacts on the state space of the qubits at processors\nuandv, respectively. A Local Operation assisted by two-way Classical Communication (LOCC)\nis a local operation that depends on classical information exchanged between nodes [10], e.g\nthe unitaries of quantum teleportation. The exchange of classical information is used to apply\nadaptive operations to qubits in different nodes. For instance, in teleportation, the classical output\nof the Bell State Measurement (BSM) performed by the sender is transmitted to the receiver,\nwhere Pauli operators that depend on the measurements results are applied.\nA quantum network protocol for Nis an algorithm that operates on the qubits at the nodes,\ntransforming their joint state. Network protocols can be modelled by LOCCs under the assump-\ntion that a sufficient number of maximally entangled states are shared among nodes before\nhand and LOCCs are used to transform the state of qubits in both control and data planes. Let\nDG=HG×HGdenote the space of density matrices spanned by all of the qubits in the network.\nSuperoperators are linear operators that transform density matrices. A protocol that requires t6\ntime steps to complete can be modeled through a superoperator Λt:DG→ D Gthat represents\nan LOCC as\nρ(t) = Λ t[ρ(0)], (1)\nwhere ρ:Z→ D Gis a time-dependent density operator determining the state of all qubits in\nthe network, and ρ(0)is a density matrix that contains all the pre-shared entanglement. Each\nstep of the protocol is itself an LOCC represented by a superoperator Ξj:DG→ D Gsuch that\nΛt= Ξ t−1◦. . .◦Ξ0[ρ(0)] [29], where ◦denotes the composition operation for superoperators.\nIn fact, it is also possible to model a protocol as a sequence of external (mediated by channels)\nand internal (local to vertices) time-dependent superoperators Γt:DG→ D GandΦt:DG→ D G,\nrespectively, such that the state of the network is described as\nρ(t+ 1) = Φ t[Γt[ρ(t)]], (2)\nw\nD G,\nrespectively, such that the state of the network is described as\nρ(t+ 1) = Φ t[Γt[ρ(t)]], (2)\nwhere Γtdoes not represent an LOCC, although Φtdoes, and pre-shared entanglement is not\nassumed. As an example, it is usually the case for entanglement distribution protocols that Γt\nrepresents link-level entanglement generation protocols performed at all channels of the network\nandΦtrepresents either entanglement swap operations or GHZ projections performed at multiple\nnodes. The pre-shared entanglement model summarized by (1) has proven useful since it allows\nfor the derivation of fundamental bounds for entanglement distribution rate [29]. In this article,\nhowever, our focus is on the design of network protocols for the transmission of quantum\ninformation under the assumption that quantum error correction is provided by the network, i.e.,\nthe network is noiseless. In particular, we exploit the representation in (2) considering Γtand\nΦtas fault tolerant operators provided by the network instead of generic superoperators and\nperform the analysis in the state vector formalism.\nB. Quantum walks on graphs\nThere are many ways to define a quantum walk on a graph and this article focuses on the\ndiscrete-time coined quantum walk model. Given a symmetric directed graph G= (V, E), a\ncoined quantum walk on Gis a process of unitary evolution on the Hilbert space HG=HV⊗HC\nformed by the edges of the graph, where HVcodifies vertices and HCis the coin space of the\nwalker codifying the degrees of freedom the walker can move on. In particular, each vertex v\ndefines a set of degrees of freedom, or coin values, Cv={0,1, . . . , d (v)−1}such that, every7\n(v, u)∈Eis uniquely assigned to a coin value cvu∈ C v. In turn, every (v, u)∈Edefines a\nbasis vector |v, cvu⟩forHG. The tensor product structure of HGimposes that the coin space\nhasmax vδ(v)dimensions and the number of basis vectors in HGexceeds the number of edges\ninGfor non-regular graphs, i.e., graphs with nodes of different degrees. L\nceeds the number of edges\ninGfor non-regular graphs, i.e., graphs with nodes of different degrees. Later, cvwill be used\nto represent the self-loop (v, v). The generic state of the walker |Ψ(t)⟩=Pψ(v, c, t )|v, c⟩is a\nsuperposition of the edges of Gand the walker evolution is defined as\n|Ψ(t+ 1)⟩=S(t)C(t)|Ψ(t)⟩, (3)\nwhere CandSare respectively referred to as the coin and shift operators. The coin is a unitary\noperator of the form\nC(t) =X\nv|v⟩⟨v| ⊗Cv(t), (4)\nwhere Cv:HCv→ H Cv. The shift can be defined as any permutation operator on the edges\nof the graph that maps an edge (v1, u)to an edge (u, v 2). This mapping of edges represents a\npermutation between states |v1, cv1u⟩and|u, cuv2⟩. Two shift operators are used throughout this\nwork: the identity operator, which is a trivial permutation of the edges, and the flip-flop shift\noperator given by\nSf=X\nv∈VX\nu∈δ(v)|v, cvu⟩⟨u, cuv|, (5)\nwhich applies, for every (v, u)∈E, the permutation (v, u)→(u, v).Sfreverses edges in the\nwalker wavefunction and is well defined for every symmetric directed graph. In the general case\nof non-regular graphs, we define coin and shift operators without specifying the transformation of\nbasis vectors that do not correspond to proper edges of the graph and define such transformation\nas the identity mapping. The labels of nodes and degrees of freedom are expressed as binary\nstrings, and we denote the bit-wise negation of label casc. Note that cvuis not necessarily cuv.\nIt is of interest to consider systems formed by multiple quantum walks that are allowed to\ninteract with each other. For simplicity, we consider systems where the coin and shift operators do\nnot introduce entanglement among the states of the different walks, and define a walk-interaction\noperator to account for such entanglement. In this case, the coin and shift operators for a single\nwalker system extend to multiple quantum walks by considering direct tensor product extensions.\nIn particular, consider a system formed by kquantum wa\nconsidering direct tensor product extensions.\nIn particular, consider a system formed by kquantum walks. Let Cj(t)andSj(t)denote the8\ncoin and shift operators for the j-th walker at instant t, for j∈ {0,1, . . . , k −1}, respectively.\nThe coin operator assumes the form\nC(t) =k−1O\nj=0Cj(t), (6)\nwhere Cj(t)follows (4), and the shift operator is given by\nS(t) =k−1O\nj=0Sj(t), (7)\nwhere Sjfollows (5). Moreover, let I(t) :Hk\nG→ Hk\nGdenote the operator defining the interaction\nfor a system of kquantum walks at instant t. We consider operators of the form\nI(t) = (X\nv|v⟩⟨v|⊗k⊗Uv(t)) + ( 1Hkv−X\nv|v⟩⟨v|⊗k)⊗1Hk\nC(8)\nwhere Uv(t) :Hk\nC→ Hk\nCis an arbitrary unitary operator acting on the coin space of all kwalks.\nOperators following (8) allow for the interaction of quantum walker systems based on vertex\nposition. More precisely, two quantum walks on Gare allowed to interact non-trivially at time\ntif, and only if, edges of the form (v, u)∈Efor at least one vertex v∈Vhave non-zero\ncomponents in the state of both walks at t. Once the interaction operator is considered, the\nevolution of the system of multiple quantum walks assumes the form\n|Ψ(t+ 1)⟩=S(t)C(t)I(t)|Ψ(t)⟩. (9)\nThe interaction operator in (8) does not allow quantum walks to propagate among neighboring\nnodes of the graph, a behavior that is captured exclusively by the shift operator in the evolution\nof both single and multiple quantum walks. Later on, we will describe walk evolution processes\nwhere multiple interaction and coin operators are applied to the system in any order, at the same\ntime step t, before the shift operator is applied to the system.\nIII. Q UANTUM WALK CONTROL PLANE PROTOCOL\nA direct way of controlling operations in a quantum network with a quantum walk is to\ncouple the walker and the qubits in the nodes, using supersposition in the walker system to\nimplement distributed quantum operations. We describe this joint system in the noiseless setting,\nunder the assumption that quantum error correction is provid\n joint system in the noiseless setting,\nunder the assumption that quantum error correction is provided by the network. Let N′=\n(V, E∪{(v, v),∀v∈V})be the graph obtained by adding self-loops to a network N. From now\non,Edenotes the set of network edges that include self-loops. HW=HV⊗ HCdenotes the9\nspace of a walker system on N′.Hg=HW⊗ HM⊆ HGdenotes the Hilbert space spanned by\nthe walker and the data plane. The walker system is assumed to be implemented in the network\ncontrol plane in a distributed way, such that HW⊆ H N. In essence, each node vcontributes\nsome or all of the qubits in Nvto describe the space HW. Since the Hilbert space of the walker\nsystem represents an edge of N′as a basis vector, the dimension of the Hilbert space HNmust\nbe at least |E|forHWto be a subspace. When kquantum walks are considered, Hk\nWis the space\nformed by all walkers, the dimension of HNmust be at least |E|k, andHg=Hk\nW⊗HM⊆ HG.\nIn this context, the size of the logical space required for the network control plane to implement\nkquantum walkers is on the order of O(klog(|E|))qubits. We specify that each network node\ncontains O(klog|E|)control qubits in order to support kconcurrent walks, leading to a total\nofO(k|E|log|E|)logical qubits in the control plane. This conservative approach ensures that\nthe number of control plane qubits is vastly greater than the minimum number required, while\ndefining resources that are polynomial with respect to the network size. Note that implementing\na logical space of this dimension with quantum error correction requires a larger number of\nphysical qubits [30], although addressing this requirements is out of the scope of this work.\nThroughout the analysis presented, let |Ψ(t)⟩ ∈ H gdenote the joint state between the quantum\nwalkers and the data plane.\nQuantum walks are useful for implementing distributed quantum control since they naturally\ncapture the notion of locality through connectivity. The actions of coin and shift operators impose\nneighbor local\ntion of locality through connectivity. The actions of coin and shift operators impose\nneighbor locality on the state of a quantum walk: an edge (u1, v)can have a non-zero component\nin the walk state at instant tif, and only if, an edge (v, u 2)has a non-zero component in the\nstate at time t−1. This property ensures that control signals, i.e. quantum walks, must propagate\namong neighboring nodes in the network and rules out non-local operations.\nIn the remainder of this section, we define the primitive operations for the Quantum Walk\nControl Protocol (QWCP). In practice, implementing QWCP means implementing the primitive\noperations described therein.\nA. Quantum walk initialization\nThe ability to initialize quantum walks in the control plane while respecting locality is a\nfundamental operation needed by the QWCP. We require that vinitialize a quantum walk in\nstates of the form |v, c⟩for arbitrary c∈ C vwith LOCCs alone. Since the quantum walk is\nassumed to have a distributed implementation in the network, the qubits spanning the quantum10\nwalk space are spread across network nodes. LOCCs ensure that any state of such form does\nnot require entanglement across the nodes in order to initialize the walk. Moreover, it allows for\nthe exchange of classical information among nodes to coordinate the necessary local quantum\noperations to be performed.\nB. Quantum walk operators\nA quantum walk relies on two fundamental operators: the coin and shift operators. We extend\nthe definition of both operators to the joint Hilbert space Hgof the network control and data\nplanes. The coin in (4) assumes the form\nC(t) =X\nv|v⟩⟨v| ⊗Cv(t)O\nu̸=v⊗1M, (10)\nwhere 1Mdenotes the identity operator on the data plane of the network. Similarly, the extended\nshift operator has the form\nS=Sf⊗1M, (11)\nwhere Sfis given by (5). The time-dependent shift operator S(t)either follows (11), or is the\nidentity operator on the space of all qubits in the network. Equipping the QWCP with the trivial\nidentity shift is \nor on the space of all qubits in the network. Equipping the QWCP with the trivial\nidentity shift is useful as it allows for control signals to be kept within a node as time progresses,\ni.e., a wait instruction for the control signal.\nEnabling QWCP to allow for parallel propagation of multiple control signals is key to effi-\nciently distribute network services. To this purpose, we allow multiple concurrent quantum walks\nin the control space HWwhen required. The coin and shift operators for multiple walkers follow\n(6) and (7), respectively, and do not introduce entanglement among the states of the different\nwalks. Similar to the single-walker case, both operators are defined for Hgthrough an extension\nwith1M.\nC. Control-data interactions\nInteractions between control and data qubits must respect neighbor locality in order for QWCP\nto be compatible with the quantum walk formalism. Thus, we define such interactions based on\nthe following principle. The quantum walk control plane can interact with data qubits in a node\nvat instant tif and only if there exists at least one edge of form (v, u)∈Ewith non-zero11\ncomponent in |Ψ(t)⟩. Following this principle, the interaction between a walk and the data qubits\nin the network has the form\nIWM(t) =X\nv∈V|v⟩⟨v| ⊗Uv(t)O\nu̸=v1Mu, (12)\nwhere Uv(t) : (HC⊗HMv)→(HC⊗HMv)is a time-dependent, unitary operator defined on the\njoint space of the coin and data qubits in node v, and 1Muis the identity operator on the space\nof the data qubits in node u. The operator in (12) is very general in that, if nodes implement\narbitrary operators of this form along with shift operators, they implement the quantum walk\ncontrol protocol in its full generality. It is possible to verify that coins satisfying (10) have the\nform in (12). In addition, (12) directly extends to the case of multiple walks under the assumption\nthat each walk interacts with a unique set of qubits in M, or that walk interactions commute.\nWe now prescribe two operators following (12) th\n of qubits in M, or that walk interactions commute.\nWe now prescribe two operators following (12) that are sufficient for universal distributed\nquantum computing and other network services, such as entanglement distribution, mediated by\nquantum walks. The first generalizes the coin operator in (10) to\nC(t) =X\nv|v⟩⟨v| ⊗Cv(t)⊗Uv(t), (13)\nwhere Uv(t) :HM→ H Mis a unitary operator on the data space of the network written as\nUv(t) =Kv(t)O\nu̸=v1Mu, (14)\nwhere Kv(t) :Mv→ M vis a unitary operator on the space spanned by the data qubits in node\nv. Essentially, C(t)applies the operator Kv(t)on qubits in vif and only if the walker has a\nnon-zero wavefunction component in v. The operator C(t)in (13) extends the definition in (10)\nto perform unitary operations on the data qubit space controlled by vertex position. It allows for\noperations on the coin space of the walk through operators Cv(t)and data-control interactions\nthrough operators Uv(t), for every v∈V. Consider the case where a set of qubits Qv⊆ M vin\nnode vis used to control unitary operations in the coin space of the walker. Let\nUQv(t) =X\ns∈{0,1}|Qv|Uvs(t)⊗ |s⟩⟨s|O\nq′/∈Qv1q′, (15)\nbe a unitary operator acting on the coin space of vertex vcontrolled by the qubits in Qv, defined\non the joint space HC⊗ HM. The second operator has the form\nO(t) =X\nv|v⟩⟨v| ⊗UQv(t). (16)12\nD. Control-Control Interactions\nThe QWCP allows for interactions between multiple quantum walks. This is useful for ex-\npanding the control plane beyond distributed quantum computing, and brings flexibility to the\nimplementation of distributed controlled quantum gates. Interactions between quantum walks\ntake the form of (8), extended to Hgwith1M, and do not change the state of data qubits in the\nnetwork. We focus on interaction operators for two quantum walks of the form\nIvc(t) = [( 1H2\nV− |v, v⟩⟨v, v|)⊗1H2\nC] +{|v, v⟩⟨v, v| ⊗[|c⟩⟨c| ⊗Uvc+ (1HC− |c⟩⟨c|)⊗1HC]},\n(17)\nwhere v∈Vis an arbitrary node. Note that we changed the order of the Hilbert space\nrepresenta\n,\n(17)\nwhere v∈Vis an arbitrary node. Note that we changed the order of the Hilbert space\nrepresentation for two quantum walks from HV⊗ HC⊗ H V⊗ HCtoH2\nV⊗ H2\nCin order to\nsimplify the description of Ivc(t).Ivc(t)performs the unitary operation Uvcin the coin space of\nthe second walk controlled by the state |c⟩of the coin space of the first. Operators of the form\nin (17) allow for the preparation of walk states that have Bell-state-like entanglement structures.\nFor instance, assume that the state of two walks at instant tis\n|Ψ(t)⟩W=|v, c 0⟩+|v, c 1⟩√\n2⊗ |v, c 0⟩. (18)\nBy letting Uvcas a permutation operator, the state\n|Ψ(t)⟩W=|v, c 0, v, c 0⟩+|v, c 1, v, c 1⟩√\n2(19)\nis obtained with one application of (17). GHZ-like entanglement for multiple quantum walks is\nsimilarly obtained by repeating the application of the control-control operation targeting different\npairs of quantum walks at every application.\nIV. D ISTRIBUTED QUANTUM GATES WITH ONE QUANTUM WALK\nThe operators described in Section III constitute the fundamental operations of the QWCP and\ncan be used to execute remote gates in a quantum network. In this section, we apply the QWCP\nto implement distributed multi-qubit quantum gates with one quantum walk. In particular, we\ndefine operations that allow a quantum walk to propagate control signals across paths of the\nnetwork. The results presented therein show that the QWCP is universal for distributed quantum\ncomputing.13\nA. Path propagation and universality\nConsider performing an arbitrary two-qubit controlled gate CU:H4→ H4of the form\nCU=|0⟩⟨0| ⊗1H2+|1⟩⟨1| ⊗U, (20)\nwhere U:H2→ H2is a single-qubit gate, using qubit a∈ M Ain node A∈Vas control\nand qubit b∈ M Bin node B∈Vas target. We now show how the protocol can be used to\nimplement CUand, thus, that it is universal for distributed quantum computing. This last claim\nstems from the fact that a remote Controlled- X(CNOT) gate can be executed between any\ntwo nodes of the network using the techniques presented therein. \n) gate can be executed between any\ntwo nodes of the network using the techniques presented therein. To simplify notation, we only\ndefine terms for the operators C(t)in (13) and O(t)in (16) for the subspaces spanned by the\nqubits in nodes AandB, considering undefined operators to be identities, and omit the qubits\ninM \\ { a, b}. We use subscripts to refer to qubits, e.g|A, c Au,0a,1b⟩ ∈ H W⊗ H4represents\nthe walker in edge (A, u), and qubits ain the |0⟩state and bin the |1⟩state, where H4is the\nHilbert space spanned by 2 qubits. Moreover, coin-space permutations are instrumental for the\nmethods presented in this section. Given two degrees of freedom cvu, cvw∈ Cvfor vertex v∈V,\nthe operator of the form\nCcvucvw\nv =|cvu⟩⟨cvw|+|cvu⟩⟨cvw|+X\nc∈Cv\nc̸=cvu,cvw|c⟩⟨c| (21)\npermutes cvuwithcvwwhile leaving all other degrees of freedom of vunchanged.\nWe consider the initial state of the walker to be |A, c A⟩, which corresponds to a self-loop in\nnode A∈V. Thus, the global system is described by the state vector |Ψ(0)⟩=|A, c A⟩⊗(α|0a⟩+\nβ|1a⟩)⊗ |Ψb⟩, where |Ψb⟩is the state of b. The interaction operator O(t) =P\nv|v⟩⟨v|⊗UQv(t)\ndescribed in (16) is applied with UQv=U{a}given by the controlled coin space permutation\noperation in (21) as\nU{a}=ICA⊗ |0⟩⟨0|+CcAc\nA⊗ |1⟩⟨1|, (22)\nwhere c̸=CAis any degree of freedom of Aand which generates the entangled state\nO(0)|Ψ(0)⟩= (α|A, c A,0⟩+β|A, c,1⟩)⊗ |Ψb⟩. (23)\nOur goal is to determine quantum walk operators that evolve this entangled state between control\nand data to a state of the form |Ψ(t)⟩= (α|A, c A,0⟩+β|B, c B,1⟩)⊗ |Ψb⟩. When such a state\nis obtained, CU is implemented with the application of the extended coin operator defined in14\n(13) and (14), with Kb=Uand all other operators defined as identities. The final state obtained\nis\nC(t)|Ψ(t)⟩=α|A, c A,0,Ψb⟩+β(1⊗U)|B, c B,1,Ψb⟩, (24)\nwhich shows the application of CUcontrolled by awithbas a target. Note that the state obtained\nin (24) is entangled with the walker subsystem; we will later demons\nt. Note that the state obtained\nin (24) is entangled with the walker subsystem; we will later demonstrate how to separate the\ndata qubits from the walker.\nQuantum walk evolution is restricted to neighbor locality, such that, to have the state given\nin (24) at time t, all of the wavefunction at time t−1must exclusively be a superposition of\nedges incident to nodes AandB, and its neighbors. There are many ways to define coin and\nshift operators with this behavior and we focus on the case where the quantum walk traverses\na single path connecting AandB. Some auxiliary definitions and assumptions are required to\ndescribe the operators in this context. Let pbe a path of the network connecting AandBwith\nhop distance ∆p(A, B). We assume every node knows the network topology and that classical\ninformation can be transmitted between the nodes. Recall that the edges of N′are mapped to\nwalker states following the relation (v, u)→ |v, cvu⟩, and that the self-loop (v, v)is mapped to\nthe degree of freedom cv, for all v. We refer to the edge that connects Ato its neighbor in p\nas|A, cp\nA⟩and the reverse edge that connects Bto its preceding vertex in pas|B, cp\nB⟩. This\nnotation is depicted in Figure 1 for a 2D-grid network. For simplicity, assume that propagation\nstarts at time t= 0. Neighbor locality implies that ∆p(A, B)steps are required to complete\nwalker propagation through p.\nPath propagation starts with the state in (23) with c=Cp\nA, as depicted in Fig.2a. We use\nthe extended flip-flop shift operator, (11), to route information during all time steps, a behavior\nportrayed in Fig.2b. The coin operator is also time-independent, although it depends on the path\npchosen. All operators Cvin (13) follow (21) and have the form Cp\nv=Cc1c2v, where c1andc2\nrefer to the degrees of freedom that represent the edges incident to vinp. Thus, we define Cp\nv\nspecifying c1andc2for the vertices of interest, and assume that Cu(t) =1Cufor all nodes u /∈p\nand for node A. Let wandvbe the neighbors of \nnterest, and assume that Cu(t) =1Cufor all nodes u /∈p\nand for node A. Let wandvbe the neighbors of u∈p\\{A, B}on the path p.Cuhasc1=cuw\nandc2=cuv, representing a permutation between edges (u, w)and(u, v)inpthat is shown\nin Fig.2c for w=A. The operator Cp\nBhasc1=cp\nBandc2=cB, providing the permutation\nbehavior depicted in Fig.2d. It suffices to set Kv(t) = IMvin (14) to perform the desired\ncontrolled operation between aandb, although it is possible to perform operations controlled by15\n(a) Path pconnecting AandB.\n (b) Map between edges and vectors.\nFig. 1: Notation for edges exemplified in a grid graph. Consider that AandBare two nodes\nconnected in a 2D grid network. (a) pis a minimum path connecting AandBwith hop-distance 3\ntraversed by the walker. (b) Each edge on the path corresponds to a vector in HW, which appear\nin the walker wavefunction throughout movement. The degrees of freedom are defined such\nthat|x, cxy⟩represents edge (x, y). As an example, the flip-flop operator specified in (5) maps\n|v, cvu⟩ → | u, cuv⟩, while the operator Cudefined in terms of (21) maps |u, cuA⟩ → | u, cuv⟩.\naon the qubits in the intermediate nodes as the walker moves by choosing Kv(t)accordingly.\nIn particular, assume that gate Uvcontrolled by qubit ainAmust be performed on the data\nqubits in v, for all v∈p\\ {A, B}. The gates are implemented by taking Kv(∆p(A, v)) = Uv\nfor all v∈p.\nQuantum control through path propagation is directly extended to gates controlled by multiple\nqubits in A, such as a Toffoli gate, and for gates with multiple targets. Toffoli-like behavior is\nachieved by using initial interaction operators of the form\nUQA=ICA⊗(1− |s⟩⟨s|) +CcAc\nA⊗ |s⟩⟨s|, (25)\nwhere sis a|QA|-bit string that determines the state of the data qubits QAin node Aused for\ncontrol. For gates with multiple targets, it suffices to modify the operator Kv(t)accordingly.\nThe overall behavior of the walker is illustrated in Figure 2. The initial state in (23) is\na superposition between the states |A,\nlker is illustrated in Figure 2. The initial state in (23) is\na superposition between the states |A, c A⟩and|A, cp\nA⟩that are entangled with qubit ain\nnode A. The flip-flop shift propagates the state component |A, cp\nA⟩along pand ensures that\n|A, c A⟩remains in superposition throughout protocol execution. Coin operators act as forwarding\noperations in the nodes ensuring propagation. The net effect of ∆p(A, B)successive applications\nofS(t)C(t)is the superposition specified in (24).16\n(a) Coin in A.\n (b) Flip-flop shift\n (c) Coins in path.\n (d) Final state.\nFig. 2: Protocol execution in a 3-by-3grid with a quantum walk through a path p.

(a) The initial state\nof execution is generated by the application of the controlled operation demonstrated in (23)\nwith the coin permutation operator in (21). (b) The flip-flop shift exchanges edge (A, u)with\nedge (u, A), moving the walker while mapping the self-loop edge to itself. (c) After the first\ncoin flip, all subsequent coin operators work as shift operators inside a node, mapping degrees\nof freedom in order to propel the walker towards B. (d) After ∆p(A, B) = 3 steps, the final\nwavefunction is a uniform superposition between edges (A, A)and(B, w), which can be used\nto perform an operation controlled by qubit alocated in Awith target qubit blocated in B.\nB. Separating data and control\nThe entangled state prescribed in (24) includes both control and data qubits. Hence a partial\ntrace operation on the walker system will not leave the state of aandbas it would be if the\noperation where performed without the walker. We propose two solutions in order to overcome\nthis problem both of which can be generalized to the case of more complex quantum gates\ndistributed by multiple quantum walks.\nThe first technique consists of control operations directed at concentrating the walker’s wave-\nfunction into a single network node, such as by propagating the wal\nconcentrating the walker’s wave-\nfunction into a single network node, such as by propagating the walker wavefunction from\nboth AandBto an intermediate node. This operations can be performed in parallel with any\nfurther quantum operations that nodes AandBmay perform on their data qubits and does\nnot impact computation time. For simplicity, we report a strategy where the walker evolu-\ntion is reversed once the coin operation that performs CU takes place by applying inverses\nof the unitary path propagation operators. Since the propagation operators are permutation17\noperators, they are Hermitian unitaries and, thus, are their own inverses. It takes ∆p(A, B)\ntime steps to reverse the walker back to Aand transform the joint state of the system to the\nform α|A, c A,0a,Ψb⟩+β(1⊗U)|A, c,1a,Ψb⟩. To finish separation, the data controlled CNOT\noperation specified in (22) provides the state |A, c A⟩ ⊗(α|0a,Ψb⟩+β(1⊗U)|1a,Ψb⟩), which\nis a separable state between control and data. The separability between the walker system and\nqubits aandbensures that the state of the qubits after a partial trace operation on the walker\nsystem is the state that one obtains if aandbwere in the same node and a CUgate was applied\nlocally.\nThe second method relies on local measurements of control registers in nodes AandBthat\ndo not destroy the state of qubits aandb. For ease of explanation, assume CA=CB= 0, which\ncan always be performed with a coin permutation operator. Moreover, let BABbe a basis for the\nvertex space HVthat contains the orthogonal vectors\n|AB +⟩=|A⟩+|B⟩√\n2and|AB−⟩=|A⟩ − |B⟩√\n2. (26)\nLet|Ψ±\nab⟩=α|0,Ψb⟩ ±β(1⊗U)|1,Ψb⟩. In the basis BABfor the vertex space, the entangled\nstate in (24) becomes\n|AB +⟩ |Ψ+\nab⟩+|AB−⟩ |Ψ−\nab⟩√\n2. (27)\nThe structure of this last state shows that a projective measurement of the vertex space in the basis\nBABwill decouple control and data, leaving the data qubits in the desired state up to a Zgate\ncorrection in qubit athat depends on the classical values of the me\n the desired state up to a Zgate\ncorrection in qubit athat depends on the classical values of the measurement outcome. We now\ndemonstrate that measurements in BABare indeed local operations and represent local Xbasis\nmeasurements of the qubits spanning the vertex space. A=A1. . . A kandB=B1. . . B kare\ntwok-bit binary strings, where kdepends on a particular implementation of the quantum walk.\nNaturally, j≥1bits must differ in AandB, otherwise A=B. Without loss of generality,\nassume that the distinct bits are the last jbits in AandB, i.e., A=A1. . . A kandB=\nA1. . . A k−jAk−j+1. . .Akand the basis states can be written as\n|AB±⟩=|A1. . . A k−j⟩ ⊗|Ak−j+1. . . A k⟩ ± |Ak−j+1. . .Ak⟩√\n2, (28)\nwhere the state after the tensor product sign is a generalized j-qubit GHZ state. It is known\nfrom the structure of GHZ states that local measurements in the Xbasis yield the desired result.\nIn particular, a projective measurement in a basis following BABcan be performed by locally\nmeasuring the first k−jvertex space qubits in the Zbasis and the remaining jqubits in the X18\nbasis. The distributed implementation of the quantum walk implies that, in general, the vertex\nqubits are spread across multiple nodes in the network. Nonetheless, the measurements considered\nare local and can be implemented without the need for distributed entanglement across the nodes.\nFinally, the measurement outcomes must be transmitted to node Bvia classical communication\nto control a correction operation.\nSeparating control and data with the methods described imposes different requirements on\nutilization of computing and networking resources. Reversing the quantum walk evolution does\nnot increase computation time as operations on the data qubits can be executed concurrently,\nalthough it demands the use of quantum channels for separability after a control operation\nis performed. On the other hand, local measurements only require the exchange of classical\ncommunication among nodes, albeit they increase comput\nements only require the exchange of classical\ncommunication among nodes, albeit they increase computation time when quantum circuits\nperformed in node Bdo not commute with Zgates. Therefore, the methods can be used to\noptimize resource utilization based on different goals in order to improve the efficiency of the\nQWCP under distinct scenarios.\nC. Controlling operations with qubits in different nodes\nThe path propagation procedure is easily modified to allow for execution of remote gates\ncontrolled by multiple qubits at different nodes. For instance, consider the case of a Toffoli gate\ntargeting qubit bin node Bcontrolled by qubits a0anda1in nodes A0andA1, respectively. Path\npropagation can be used to implement the gate by sending the walker from A0toBthrough a\npath passing through node A1. Following the results presented for path propagation, it suffices to\ndemonstrate how the quantum walk state is capable of acquiring the proper dependence with the\nstate of qubits a0anda1. We now show how a Toffoli gate is performed, focusing on the joint\nstate of the quantum walk system with qubits a0anda1. The techniques are directly applicable\nto gates with arbitrary numbers of control qubits at different nodes.\nAssume that the quantum walk is initialized at node A0. The initial procedure used for path\npropagation, which applies the interaction operator in (16) using the coin permutation operator\nin (21) generates a state of the form\n|Ψ(0)⟩= (α0|A0, cA0,0a0⟩+β0|A0, c0,1a0⟩)⊗(α1|0a1⟩+β1|1a1⟩), (29)\nwhere αj, βjare the amplitudes defining the state of control qubit aj, forj∈ {0,1}, and c0∈ CA0\nis a given degree of freedom of A0. The state in (29) is similar to that in (23), although it shows19\nthe states of the control qubits explicitly. Once this initial state is prepared the walk from A0\nacross path ptoA1yields a state of the form\n|Ψ(∆ p(A0, A1))⟩= (α0|A0, cA0,0a0⟩+β0|A1, cA1,1a0⟩)⊗(α1|0a1⟩+β1|1a1⟩). (30)\nAn interaction operator between data and control using the controlled coin\n)⊗(α1|0a1⟩+β1|1a1⟩). (30)\nAn interaction operator between data and control using the controlled coin permutation operator\nCcA1c1\nA1following (21), where c1∈ CA1, yields\nα0α1|A0, cA0,0a0,0a1⟩+α0β1|A0, cA0,0a0,1a1⟩+β0α1|A1, cA1,1a0,0a1⟩+β0β1|A1, c1,1a0,1a1⟩.\n(31)\nThe component |A1, c1⟩of the state carries the necessary control for a the Toffoli gate controlled\nbya0anda1, and can be transmitted to node B. In this case, the Toffoli gate can be implemented\nat time ∆p(A0, A1) + ∆ p(A1, B)using a coin operator following (13) and (14), with KB\nperforming an Xgate on qubit b. Generic n-qubit gates, which are controlled operations of\nthe form\nCU=|s⟩⟨s| ⊗U+ (1− |s⟩⟨s|)⊗1 (32)\nfor some n′-bit string s, with n′\u003C n andU:H2(n−n′)→ H2(n−n′)can be implemented using\nthis procedure.\nThe single-path propagation procedure described in Section IV-A suffices for universal quan-\ntum computing. This implies that the aforementioned multi-qubit controlled gates can be imple-\nmented by first decomposing the gate into two-qubit gates and then performing each of these gates\nwith the control protocol. The results shown in this section add to the initial path-propagation\nscheme by providing a way to implement these gates using network resource differently.\nV. P ARALLEL CONTROL PROPAGATION WITH MULTIPLE QUANTUM WALKS\nWe applied the QWCP in the previous section to implement distributed quantum gates. This\nextends to parallel control signal propagation with multiple quantum walks, as we show next.\nLetAdenote the node in the network containing control qubits. Let Bk={B0, . . . , B k−1}\ndenote a set of target nodes. For simplicity, assume the goal of performing gate CUj:H4→ H4\nfollowing (20) controlled by qubit ain node Awith target qubit bjin node Bj, forj= 0, . . . , k −\n1. There are two extensions to propagate control signals in order to perform these gates in parallel.\nThe first allows multiple entangled quantum walks through distinct paths. The second propagates\nentangled control signals through a\ngled quantum walks through distinct paths. The second propagates\nentangled control signals through a directed rooted tree in the network.20\nA. Control fan-out signals\nWe introduce a branching operator for quantum walks in order to present parallel propagation\nwith entangled walkers. This operation consists of successive applications of the control-control\ninteraction operator, (17), to generate entangled quantum walks as follows. Suppose a quantum\nwalker is received at time tat node v∈Vandkwalkers entangled with the received walker\nmust each be propagated to a neighbor vj∈δ(v)ofv, for j∈ {0, . . . , k −1}. LetVv=\n{v0, . . . , v k−1} ⊆δ(v)denote the set of neighbors of vto which these kcontrol signals must\nbe propagated. Without loss of generality, assume the state of the walker received at node vis\n|ΨW⟩=α|A, c A⟩+β|v, c⟩, where α, β∈Candc∈ Cvis any degree of freedom of the walker.\nk−1walkers are initialized at node v, and the joint state of all kquantum walks is\n|ΨW(t)⟩= (α|A, c A⟩+β|v, cv⟩)⊗ |v, cv⟩⊗k−1. (33)\nApplying operator Ivcvgiven by (17) with Uvc=Cccvvj\nv following (21), using the first walk as\ncontrol and the j-th walk as target, for each vj∈ V v, yields the GHZ-like entangled state of\nform\nIVv|Ψ(t)⟩=α(|A, c A⟩ ⊗ |v, cv⟩⊗k−1) +β|v, c, v, c vv1, . . . , v, c vvk−1⟩, (34)\nwhere IVvdenotes the product of all control-control operators Ivcvused. The 1-to- kcontrol\nfan-out operator FcVv:Hk\nW→ Hk\nWhas the form\nFcVv= (CcVv⊗1Hk−1\nW)IVv, (35)\nwhere CcVv:HW→ H Wis the coin operator for the first quantum walk given by\nCcVv= (|v⟩⟨v| ⊗Cccvu0v) + (1HV− |v⟩⟨v|)⊗1Hc, (36)\nwith Cccvu0v following (21). FcVvyields an entangled state of the kwalkers with a component\n|v, cvu0, . . . v, c vuk−1⟩where the j-th walker points to the edge (v, uj)forj= 0, . . . , k −1. The\nshift operator moves each walker in superposition to the corresponding neighbor of v. Note that\nthe first quantum walker received at vis sent to node u0and 1-to- kcontrol fan-out initializes\nk−1walkers in v.\nB. Para\nalker received at vis sent to node u0and 1-to- kcontrol fan-out initializes\nk−1walkers in v.\nB. Parallel control through multiple paths\nLetP={p0, . . . , p k−1}denote a set of paths where pjstarts at Aand ends at Bj∈Bkfor\nj= 0, . . . , k −1. The analysis of a single walker system extends to multiple walker systems21\nby using one quantum walk to propagate control signals through each path in P. The process\nstarts with the initialization of one walker in Aand the application of interaction operator in\n(16) to generate the entangled state between walker and data shown in (23), where cp\nA=cp0\nA\nin this case. Let VP\nAdenote the set of neighbors of Ain each path in P. The control fan-out\noperator Fcp0\nAVP\nA, (35), is applied to prepare one walker for each path in P. Assign walker j\nto path pj. Shift operators for all quantum walkers are time-independent and follow (11). The\ncoin operator Cpj(t) :Hk\nW→ Hk\nWfor walker jis defined to obtain the propagation behavior\ndepicted in Fig.2. The separability of the individual coins for each walker yields the k-walker\ncoin operator CP(t) :Hk\nW→ Hk\nWfor the set of paths Pof the form\nCP(t) =k−1O\nj=0Cpj(t). (37)\nWalker jreaches node Bjafter ∆(A, B j)steps of evolution and gate CUjis implemented by\napplying the extended coin operator in (13) and (14) with KBj=Uj.\nC. Parallel control through trees\nSuppose we are given a directed tree T= (VT, ET)⊆Nrooted in node Acontaining\nthe target nodes in Bk. Let p(v)∈δ(v)denote the predecessor of v∈VT\\ {A}inT. Let\nS(v)⊂δ(v)denote the set of successors of node v∈VTinT. We now define operations for\nthe parallel propagation of control signals through Tsuch that each node in VT\\ {A}receives\nexactly one walker throughout the process. For simplicity, we define coin operators as specified\nin (13) by determining Cv(t)for the nodes in VT, including the coins required for the fan-\nout operation in (35), and define Cu(t) =1Muforu /∈ T . Coins for nodes Bj∈Bkhave\nUv(t) =UjN\nu̸=v1Muin order to realize gates CUj, \nne Cu(t) =1Muforu /∈ T . Coins for nodes Bj∈Bkhave\nUv(t) =UjN\nu̸=v1Muin order to realize gates CUj, while coins for nodes v∈VT\\Bkhave\nUv(t) =1Mand reduce to the form in (10). Similar to the case for multiple paths, the process\nstarts at Awith the preparation of an entangled state between data and control as shown in (23),\nand all shift operators follow (11). There are three possible control operations performed at each\nnode v∈VT. If|S(v)|= 1,Cv(t) =Cc1c2vfollowing (21) with c1=cvp(v)andc2=cvu, where\nu∈ S(v)denotes the unique successor of vinT. When |S(v)|\u003E1, the control fan-out operator\nFcVvgiven by (35) is applied with c=cvp(v)andVv=S(v). If|S(v)|= 0, i.e., vis a leaf of\nT,Cv(t) =1Cv. In the case of node A,cvp(v)is replaced with the degree of freedom cused\nin (23). A walker system reaches node v∈ T at time t= ∆T(A, v), where ∆T(A, v)is the hop\ndistance between AandvinT.22\nVI. A PPLICATION TO ENTANGLEMENT DISTRIBUTION\nIn this section, we apply the QWCP to implement entanglement distribution in the network.\nWe also discuss how entanglement distribution protocols defined in the literature [31]–[36] can\nbe deployed using QWCP operators.\nA. Entanglement distribution through quantum gate distribution\nA straightforward way to perform entanglement distribution with the QWCP is to use the\nprotocol to distribute local quantum circuits that generate desired entangled states. The operations\nspecified for distributing quantum gates in Sections IV and V are directly applicable in this case.\nEach multi-qubit gate required in an entangled state preparation circuit can be distributed through\nquantum walks using one or multiple paths, or network trees. For instance, an n-qubit GHZ state\ncan be locally generated with one Hadamard and n−1CNOT gates, and each CNOT can be\ndistributed using the QWCP.\nB. Generating GHZ states through paths and trees\nWe now shift gears to detail how the parallel control propagation operations can be modified\nto implement GHZ-state distribution on paths and\nllel control propagation operations can be modified\nto implement GHZ-state distribution on paths and trees. We describe the main idea for paths,\nand the extension for trees is obtained by replacing multi-path control propagation with tree\ncontrol propagation. Suppose that a set of kpathsP={p0, . . . , p k−1}in the network is given.\nThe goal is to generate kindependent GHZ states across data qubits at each node of each path\ninP. LetQjvdenote the set of data qubits at node vin path pjwhich must be part of the\nsame GHZ state, for j∈ {0, . . . , k −1}, andQj=S\nv∈pjQjv. For simplicity, let XQjvdenote\nthe application of the single-qubit Pauli Xgate on all qubits in Qjvextended to the entire data\nplane using the identity operator. Since GHZ states related to different paths are independent,\nQi∩ Q j={}fori, j∈ {0, . . . , k −1}andi̸=j. Let AjandBjdenote the first and last nodes\nin path pj, respectively. The process starts in parallel at all nodes Aj,j∈ {0, . . . , k −1}, at time\nt= 0by locally preparing the data qubits in QjAin a GHZ state. The data controlled interaction\noperator in (16) is applied to generate the following entangled state\n|Ψ(0)⟩=kO\nj=01√\n2(|Aj, cAj⟩ |00. . .0⟩QjAj+|Aj, cApj\nj⟩ |11. . .1⟩QjAj). (38)\nThe desired GHZ states are obtained by applying the coin and shift operations specified in\nSection IV for each path in P, with a slight modification in the coin operators. In this case, the23\nbehavior of the coin operation, (13), for the j-th walker at node v∈pj\\ {Aj}is of the form\nCv(t)⊗XQjv. Thus, at time step ∆pj(A, v), the coin operation expands the GHZ states of data\nqubits with qubits in Qjv. The process for path pjterminates at time t= ∆ pj(A, B j), and the\noverall distributions ends at time t= max j∆pj(A, B j).\nC. Link-level entanglement generation with QWCP\nParallel link-level entanglement generation is a building block for entanglement distribution\nprotocols [31], [32], [35], [36]. In the process, neighboring network nodes use the channels that\ninterc\nocols [31], [32], [35], [36]. In the process, neighboring network nodes use the channels that\ninterconnect them to generate maximally entangled states. Link-level entanglement generation is\nperformed with quantum walks as follows, where we omit the state of data qubits for simplicity.\nLet(u, v)∈Eand assume, without loss of generality, that u \u003C v . For every pair u, v, a quantum\nwalk in state |Ψ⟩=|u, cu⟩is initialized at node u, leading to k=|E|/2quantum walks initialized\ninHN. A coin operator Cufollowing (10) that maps |u, cu⟩ →(|u, cu⟩+|u, cuv⟩)/√\n2for each\nwalk prepares all quantum walks in the network in the state\nCk(0)|Ψ(0)⟩=O\nu∈VO\nv∈δ(u),\nv\u003Eu|u, cu⟩+|u, cuv⟩√\n2., (39)\nwhere Ck(0) =N\nu∈VCudenotes the coin operator for all kquantum walks. Applying a flip-flop\nshift operator following (7) evolves the state in (39) to the form\nSCk(0)|Ψ(0)⟩=O\nu∈VO\nv∈δ(u),\nv\u003Eu|u, cu⟩+|v, cvu⟩√\n2. (40)\nEach quantum walk can generate entanglement across data qubits at neighboring nodes with the\ncoin operator in (13). Note that all quantum walks are in a separable state.\nD. Expressing entanglement distribution protocols with QWCP\nEntanglement distribution approaches that rely on path selection for the distribution of Bell\nstates, e.g., [31], [32], can be expressed using multi-path propagation. Multipartite entanglement\ndistribution protocols, e.g., [33], [34], that use network trees to prepare distributed states can\nbe expressed using tree propagation. Entanglement distribution protocols that rely on local state\nknowledge can also be expressed in terms of QWCP [35], [36]. In this case, the quantum walk\noperations must be dynamically defined based on local state of the network. For instance, the\ncoin permutation operation required at an arbitrary node vat instant tmay depend on the24\nresult of operations performed in the neighbors of vat time t−1. This dynamic behavior can\nbe obtained based on the exchange of classical information among neighboring nodes in the\nnetwork, although addressi\nd on the exchange of classical information among neighboring nodes in the\nnetwork, although addressing this in detail is out the scope of this work.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nThe quantum walk control protocol proposed in this article provides a logical description\nfor a network control plane capable of performing universal distributed quantum computing.\nThe description abstracts the implementation of the quantum walker system and of quantum\noperations in the network nodes. It considers that quantum error correction yields the application\nof fault tolerant operators. The key idea that the protocol builds upon is the use of quantum\nwalker systems as quantum control signals that propagate through the network one hop a time.\nIn spite of abstracting physical implementations, the propagation of the walker stipulates latency\nconstraints for the protocol. A generic controlled operation between a qubit in node Awith a\nqubit in node Bdemands O(∆(A, B))steps of walker evolution. In the context of a possible\nphysical realization of such control system, this latency constraint translates directly to the\nphysical distance between nodes AandB. The description of the protocol in the logical setting\nalso masks the effects of walker propagation in the fidelity of distributed operations. When\nconsidering imperfect operators, the fidelity of the final outcome is bounded by the fidelity of\nthe coin and shift operators in the quantum walk system. The protocol described was applied to\nthe task of entanglement distribution and the results highlight connections between the proposed\nprotocol and entanglement distribution protocols.\nThere are three clear directions for future work considering our results. The first relates to the\ninvestigation of physical distributed implementations for quantum walk systems in a network.\nImplementations of this sort would allow for a realistic characterization of quantities such as\nfidelity and latency. The second point is the description of control exclusively with q\nties such as\nfidelity and latency. The second point is the description of control exclusively with quantum\ninformation. In this setting, the quantum walk control plane would implement search algorithms\nin the network graph [37], substituting the path propagation defined in this work. Finally, the\nmultiple ways that the quantum walk protocol can be used to implement the same quantum gate\nin the network allows for the investigation of algorithms for optimizing circuit distribution in\nquantum networks.\nAcknowledgments —This research was supported in part by the NSF grant CNS-1955744, NSF-\nERC Center for Quantum Networks grant EEC-1941583, and MURI ARO Grant W911NF2110325.25\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

Sources of entangled optical\nphotons were essential to test the foundations of\nquantum physics through violations of Bell’s in-\nequalities. More recently, entangled many-body\nstates have been realized via strong non-linear in-\nteractions in microwave circuits with supercon-\nducting qubits. Here we demonstrate a chip-\nscale source of entangled optical and microwave\nphotonic qubits. Our device platform integrates\na piezo-optomechanical transducer with a super-\nconducting resonator which is robust under op-\ntical illumination. We drive a photon-pair gen-\neration process and employ a dual-rail encod-\ning intrinsic to our system to prepare entangled\nstates of microwave and optical photons. We\nplace a lower bound on the fidelity of the entan-\ngled state by measuring microwave and optical\nphotons in two orthogonal bases. This entangle-\nment source can directly interface telecom wave-\nlength time-bin qubits and GHz frequency su-\nperconducting qubits, two well-established plat-\nforms for quantum communication and computa-\ntion, respectively.\nOur work arises from the need for scalable techniques\nto connect\non and computa-\ntion, respectively.\nOur work arises from the need for scalable techniques\nto connect superconducting quantum processors of in-\ncreasing size and complexity [1]. In analogy with classical\ninformation processing networks, quantum networks have\nrecently been envisioned with optical channels as low loss,\nroom temperature links between superconducting proces-\nsors cooled in separate dilution refrigerator nodes. Over\nthe past two decades, optical distribution of remote en-\ntanglement has been achieved with atoms, ions, color cen-\nters, quantum dots and mechanical oscillators [2–6]. The\nmajority of such demonstrations towards optical quan-\ntum networks rely on the DLCZ protocol [7] and its vari-\nants, which are based on a quantum light-matter inter-\nface in each node of the network. In these experiments,\nentanglement is heralded between distant matter qubits\n∗These authors contributed equally\n†opainter@caltech.edu; http://copilot.caltech.eduthrough interference of emitted optical photons followed\nby single photon detection measurements. Remarkably,\nthe fidelity of the entangled pair is insensitive to opti-\ncal losses since the heralding operation naturally selects\nevents within the computational subspace. Popular vari-\nants of this scheme also provide insensitivity to differ-\nences in optical path length, and rely on preparation of\nentangled states between the matter qubit and an optical\nphotonic qubit as a key ingredient [8–11]. Recently, there\nhave been proposals to develop this fundamental capabil-\nity for superconducting qubits by using quantum trans-\nducers to prepare microwave-optical Bell states [12, 13].\nIn this work, we bring this first enabling step of a well-\nestablished optical entanglement distribution toolkit into\nthe realm of superconducting microwave circuits.\nMicrowave-optical entanglement generation with\ntransducers has been elusive due to relatively weak\nnonlinearities, noise from parasitic optical absorption\nand losses from device integr\nelatively weak\nnonlinearities, noise from parasitic optical absorption\nand losses from device integration challenges. In recent\nprogress, a bulk electro-optic transducer was used to in-\nfer continuous variable entanglement between microwave\nand optical fields at the output ports of the device [14].\nIn contrast, the entanglement fidelity in our approach\nis insensitive to losses in collection and detection of\noptical and microwave photons which are inevitable in\na realistic experimental setting. Moreover, our discrete\nvariable approach offers the advantage that a microwave\nphotonic qubit can be directly mapped onto a matter\nqubit such as a transmon with high fidelity [15]. Our\ndemonstration builds on recent technical advances with\npiezo-optomechanical transducers, where integration\nwith light-robust superconducting circuits has allowed\nthe generation of microwave-optical photon pairs via\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) [16].\nWe drive emission from such a transducer into dual-rail\noptical and microwave photonic qubits, each containing\nexactly one photon in the microwave and optical output\nports, respectively. To define the optical photonic\nqubit, we use a time-bin encoding, the preferred choice\nin long-distance optical quantum communication [17].\nTo define the microwave photonic qubit, we use two\northogonal modes which naturally arise from strongly\nhybridized acoustic and electrical resonances in our de-arXiv:2312.13559v2  [quant-ph]  22 Dec 20232\nvice. We verify entanglement by correlating microwave\nquantum state tomography results with detection of a\nsingle optical photon in a chosen time-bin, or coherent\nsuperposition of time-bins achieved with a time-delay\ninterferometer.\nsuperconducting \nkinetic inductance resonatortransducerpump\noptical photon MW photon \nωpωoωm+\n−lensedoptical/f_iber\n...\nsilicon-on-insulatorsubstrate\n-11Ey (a.u.)\nDisp.

The optical cavity in the trans-\nducer is coupled to an optical waveguide, which terminates on\nthe left edge of the chip, where a lensed optical fiber is used\nto launch pump pulses into the device, and to collect emitted\noptical photons in the reverse direction. Microwave (MW)\nphotons emitted by the device are capacitively coupled from\nthe superconducting resonator to an on-chip transmission line\nand eventually collected in a 50ohm coax cable. b.Illustra-\ntion of the SPDC process in the transducer where a pump\nphoton at frequency, ωpdecays into optical and microwave\nexcitations at frequencies, ωoandωm, respectively due to the\nparametric optomechanical interaction at a rate, Gom.

Two consecutive Gaussian\npump pulses induce emission of single optical and MW pho-\ntons into early and late modes centered at their respective\nfrequencies. Theoretically calculated intensity envelopes of\nthese modes are shown when the device is excited w\n. Theoretically calculated intensity envelopes of\nthese modes are shown when the device is excited with two\nGaussian pump pulses separated by a time delay, Td= 279ns,\nwhich ensures orthogonality of early and late modes used for\nthe dual-rail encoding.\nFig. 1a shows a simplified schematic of our microwave-\noptical entanglement source, which we operate in a dilu-\ntion refrigerator setup at a temperature of ∼20mK. De-\ntails of the device geometry and fabrication process havebeen provided in previous work [16]. Pump laser pulses\nare used to excite a piezo-optomechanical transducer con-\ntaining a silicon optomechanical crystal resonator which\nsupports optical and acoustic resonances at frequencies,\nωo≈2π×200THz and ωm≈2π×5GHz, respectively.\nCo-localized telecom photons and microwave phonons in\nthis wavelength-scale resonator can interact via radia-\ntion pressure and the photoelastic effect [18]. By tuning\nthe pump laser frequency to ωp=ωo+ωmwe induce\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion into a photon-\nphonon pair at frequencies ωoandωm, as illustrated\nin Fig. 1b. The optomechanical interaction occurs with\na parametrically enhanced strength, Gom=√npgom,\nwhere npis the number of intra-cavity pump photons\nandgom/2π= 270kHz is the optomechanical coupling\nrate at the single photon and phonon level in the device\nunder study. Single phonons from the SPDC process are\nconverted into single microwave photons in a niobium ni-\ntride superconducting kinetic inductance resonator tuned\ninto resonance with the transducer acoustic mode. This\nconversion process is mediated by a compact aluminum\nnitride piezoelectric component in the transducer, and\noccurs at a rate, gpe/2π= 1.2MHz, which exceeds damp-\ning rates of the acoustic and electrical modes in the device\nunder study [19]. Finally, as shown in Fig. 1a, both opti-\ncal and microwave photons emitted from the device de-\ncay into on-chip waveguides and are routed into a lensed\noptical fiber and a 50ohm microwave coaxial cable, re-\nspec\n waveguides and are routed into a lensed\noptical fiber and a 50ohm microwave coaxial cable, re-\nspectively.\nTo prepare entangled microwave-optical states, we ex-\ncite the device with two consecutive pump pulses. Each\npump pulse can produce a microwave-optical photon-pair\nin well-defined temporal modes, separated in time and\ncentered at frequencies, ωmandωoin the microwave and\noptical outputs, respectively. Fig. 1c shows theoretically\nexpected intensity envelopes of these ‘early’ and ‘late’\nmodes in the optical and microwave output ports of the\ndevice. The optical early and late mode envelopes adia-\nbatically follow the pump pulses since the optomechani-\ncal interaction strength, Gomis much smaller than the de-\ncay rate of the optical cavity. In our experiments, we use\nGaussian pump pulses with two sigma width, Tp= 96ns,\nand define time-bin modes for dual-rail encoding of the\noptical photonic qubit. The corresponding microwave\nearly and late modes exhibit damped oscillatory behavior\ndue to strongly coupled electrical and acoustic resonators\nin the device. By matching the duration between the\npump pulses, Td= 279ns to the electro-acoustic oscilla-\ntion period expected from microwave spectroscopy [19],\nwe can achieve orthogonal early and late modes for dual-\nrail encoding of the microwave photonic qubit. Phys-\nically, a single phonon scattered by the SPDC process\ninto the electro-acoustic coupled mode system oscillates\nbetween the acoustic and electrical resonators as it pref-\nerentially decays into the microwave output waveguide.\nWith our specific choice of the pump pulse delay, Td,\nwe excite the transducer with the late pump pulse pre-\ncisely at the moment when the phonon from the early3\npump pulse has been maximally swapped into the elec-\ntrical mode. In this setting, the joint wavefunction of\nearly and late modes in the optical and microwave out-\nput ports of the device can be written as\n|Ψ⟩ ≈ |00⟩o|00⟩m\n+√p/parenleftbig\n|10⟩o|10⟩m+eiϕp|01⟩o|01⟩m/parenrightbig\n+O(p\nice can be written as\n|Ψ⟩ ≈ |00⟩o|00⟩m\n+√p/parenleftbig\n|10⟩o|10⟩m+eiϕp|01⟩o|01⟩m/parenrightbig\n+O(p),(1)\nwhere |kl⟩o(|kl⟩m) denotes the direct product of a k-\nphoton state in the early mode and an l-photon state in\nthe late mode on the optical (microwave) output port.\nThe phase ϕp, is set by the relative phase between early\nand late pump pulses. When the scattering probability,\np≪1, the O(p) terms may be neglected and detection\nof a single optical photon can be used to post-select an\nentangled state between an optical photonic qubit in the\n{|10⟩o,|01⟩o}manifold and a microwave photonic qubit\nin the {|10⟩m,|01⟩m}manifold. The state vectors within\ncurly brackets define the native measurement basis of\nthe photonic qubits, which we call the Z-basis in refer-\nence to the north and south poles of the Bloch sphere.\nWe refer to a rotated measurement basis on the equator\nof this Bloch sphere as the X-basis. To verify entan-\nglement, we characterize correlations between the pho-\ntonic qubits in these two orthogonal bases. In our exper-\niments, we operate with optical pulses with a peak power\nof 83nW corresponding to an intra-cavity optical photon\nnumber, np= 0.8, which leads to p= 1.0×10−4. The\npower level is chosen to limit noise added due to pump-\ninduced heating of the transducer, and thereby, preserve\nmicrowave-optical entanglement. With external optical\ncollection efficiency, ηopt= 5.5×10−2and a pulse repe-\ntition rate, R= 50kHz, we detect heralding events at a\nrate, Rclick= 0.26s−1. Microwave phonon to photon con-\nversion is expected to occur with efficiency, ηmw= 0.59\nbased on the piezoelectric coupling rate and microwave\ndamping rates in our device.\nWe first measure the time-resolved microwave output\nintensity from the device conditioned on the detection\ntime of single optical photons. This allows us to char-\nacterize microwave-optical intensity correlations in the\nZ-basis. In this measurement, depicted schematically\nin Fig. 2a, optical emission from the device is de\nasis. In this measurement, depicted schematically\nin Fig. 2a, optical emission from the device is detected\non a superconducting nanowire single photon detector\n(SNSPD) after transmission through a filter setup to re-\nject pump photons. Fig.2b shows a histogram of sin-\ngle optical photon detection times revealing two nearly\nGaussian envelopes associated with the SPDC signal.\nWe use gating windows of width, 2 Tp= 192ns cen-\ntered around each pulse to define the early and late op-\ntical modes, ˆAeand ˆAl, respectively. Simultaneously, as\nshown in Fig. 2a, microwave emission from the device is\ndirected to an amplification chain with a near-quantum-\nlimited Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier\n(TWPA) as the first stage.

Data in this panel corresponds to ≈3×105\nheralding events. Error bars indicate + /−one standard de-\nviation.\ntrace for each experimental trial. We capture emission\nat the microwave resonance frequency, ωmusing a digital\nfilter matched to the theoretically expected microwave\nemission envelope, f(t−τ), where τis a variable read-\nout delay [19]. We then subtract independently cali-\nbrated amplifier-added thermal noise of approximately\n2.6 quanta via a moment inversion procedure [20]. Upon\npost-selecting measurement records from trials which\nproduced optical clicks, we observe that the microwave\nintensity conditioned on a late click is delayed with re-\nspect to that conditioned on an early click as shown\nby the solid traces in Fig. 2c. These conditional signals\ncontain a finite amount of pump-induced thermal noise\nfrom the transducer. Since p≪1, such noise is simply\ngiven by the unconditional microwave output intensity,\nshown with the dashed time trace \ne is simply\ngiven by the unconditional microwave output intensity,\nshown with the dashed time trace in Fig. 2c. The ratio of\nthe conditional and unconditional microwave intensities4\nyields the normalized microwave-optical cross-correlation\nfunction, g(2)\nACwhich reaches a maximum value of 6.8 for\nearly optical clicks, and 5.0 for late optical clicks. Both\nvalues exceed the Cauchy-Schwarz bound of 2 for thermal\nstates, and signify non-classical microwave-optical corre-\nlations [16]. By performing the matched filter operation\nat optimal microwave readout delays, TeandTl=Te+Td,\nshown by the dotted vertical lines in Fig. 2c, which maxi-\nmize the cross-correlation, we define microwave early and\nlate modes, ˆCeand ˆCl. Fig. 2d shows conditional occu-\npations of these modes with the symbol nijfor the oc-\ncupation of microwave mode jconditioned on an optical\nclick detected in mode i. Using these four conditional\nmicrowave mode occupations, we define the Z-basis visi-\nbility, Vz= (nee−nel−nle+nll)/(nee+nel+nle+nll).\nFor a Bell state without additional noise or microwave\nloss, we expect nee=nll= 1 and nel=nle= 0, resulting\ninVz= 1. On the contrary, when the microwave and op-\ntical intensities are fully uncorrelated, we expect Vz= 0.\nFrom the data in Fig. 2d, we find Vz= 0.633±0.014, in-\ndicating significant intensity correlations between early\nand late modes in the microwave and optical outputs.\nThis observation of Z-basis correlations is also com-\npatible with a statistical mixture of early and late\nmicrowave-optical photon pairs. To rule out this sce-\nnario, we characterize intensity correlations in the X-\nbasis, which are indicative of the phase coherence of the\nentangled microwave-optical state. On the optics side,\nthe measurement basis rotation is performed with a time-\ndelay interferometer inserted into the detection path as\nshown in Fig.3 a. The interferometer is built with a fiber\ndelay line in one arm to achieve the time delay, Td=\n279ns required to interfere early a\nith a fiber\ndelay line in one arm to achieve the time delay, Td=\n279ns required to interfere early and late optical time-\nbins. Additionally, the setup imprints a relative phase\nbetween the time-bins, ϕo, which is actively stabilized\nthrough feedback on a piezoelectric fiber stretcher in one\nof the arms. The relative phase between the pump pulses\nused to excite the transducer, ϕp, is controlled using an\nelectro-optic phase modulator [21]. With one output\nport of the interferometer connected to the single pho-\nton detection path, clicks registered on the SNSPD cor-\nrespond to measurement of a single photon in the mode,\n(ˆAe+ei(ϕp+ϕo)ˆAl)/√\n2. The measurement phase, ϕp+ϕo\ncan be independently calibrated by transmitting coher-\nent optical pulses through the interferometer [19]. To\nperform a basis rotation on the microwave side, we add\nthe early and late complex voltage quadratures with a\nrelative phase, ϕmin post-processing as shown in Fig.3 a.\nAfter subtracting amplifier-added noise in a manner simi-\nlar to the Z-basis measurement, we measure the moments\nof the microwave mode, ( ˆCe+eiϕmˆCl)/√\n2, averaged over\nexperimental trials. In Fig.3 b, we show conditional mi-\ncrowave output quanta measured in the X-basis by fixing\nϕm= 0, π. As the optical phase is swept by tuning ϕp\nbetween the pump pulses, we observe correlation fringes\nin the conditional microwave intensity, a clear signature\nof coherence of the entangled microwave-optical state.\nDue to the need for data at multiple optical phase set-\n/gid00065\n0.00.20.40.6Microwave quanta\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\nφp/π/gid00066\nφm= π φm= 0\n/gid00077++/gid00077+-/gid00077-+/gid00077--eiφo\nTd+\ndigita l \ndelaydigital \nphase shiftTd/gid00064\n/f_iber \ndelay line/f_iber \nstretcherC=T-1S\nbeamsplitterpumpoptical  photon\nMW photon ADC\neiφm\neiφoeiφm\n0.00.20.40.6Microwave quantaFIG. 3.

All error bars\nindicate + /−one standard deviation.\ntings for this measurement, we used three times higher\npump power ( np= 2.4) compared to the main dataset\nto speed up acquisition. We then lower the pump power\nback to np= 0.8, the setting used in the Z-basis mea-\nsurements, and repeat the X-basis measurement for two\noptical phase settings, ϕp+ϕo= 0.56π,1.56πat which\nwe define the optical mo\nasis measurement for two\noptical phase settings, ϕp+ϕo= 0.56π,1.56πat which\nwe define the optical modes, ˆA±, respectively. We mea-\nsure conditional microwave output quanta in the modes,\nˆC±forϕm= 0.56π,1.56π, respectively and obtain the\nresults shown in Fig. 3c for the four combinations of the\nX-basis modes. In a manner similar to the Z-basis cor-5\nrelation measurement, we define the X-basis visibility,\nVx, expected to equal 1 for Bell states, and 0 for an\nequal statistical mixture of early and late microwave-\noptical photon pairs. With the data in Fig. 3c, we ob-\nserve Vx= 0.611±0.034. As an additional consistency\ncheck, we swept the microwave readout phase, ϕmin\npost-processing, and found that the maximum in Vxoc-\ncurs for the phase settings, ϕm= 0.62π,1.62π, offset by\n0.06πfrom the theoretically expected modes, ˆC±.

The\nmatrices are obtained from a maximum likelihood reconstruc-\ntion procedure performed over a joint Fock space of up to six\nphotons in each mode, but are plotted in a truncated space of\nup to two photons in each mode for better visualization. En-\ntries which are expected to be non-zero for a pure microwave-\noptical Bell state are highlighted in color. b.Conditional\nprobabil\ne non-zero for a pure microwave-\noptical Bell state are highlighted in color. b.Conditional\nprobability, pijof a single photon in microwave mode jcon-\nditioned on receipt of an optical click in mode i, calculated\nfrom the density matrices in panel a after post-selecting the\nsingle photon subspace. Error bars denote uncertainties of\n+/- one standard deviation.\nThe microwave and optical emission from the device\nexhibit intensity correlations in both Z- and X-bases\nwhich are characteristic of a Bell pair prepared from\nthe pure state in Eq. 1 via optical detection. How-\never, since the experimentally prepared states have finitetransducer-added noise and microwave loss, the condi-\ntional microwave intensities have contributions from out-\nside the computational subspace where the dual-rail pho-\ntonic qubits are defined. In order to characterize entan-\nglement more precisely, we must measure both optical\nand microwave outputs in the single-photon subspace.\nSince we operate in an experimental regime where the\nscattering probability, p≪1, we fulfill the condition that\nnearly all optical detection events arise from within the\nsingle optical photon subspace [19]. On the microwave\nside, we use statistical moments of conditional hetero-\ndyne voltages to perform maximum likelihood state to-\nmography in the joint Fock basis of the early and late\nmodes [20, 22], and project onto the single photon sub-\nspace. This post-selection operation is strictly local and\ncannot generate microwave-optical entanglement. It can\nbe implemented in practice by performing a parity check\n[12], a well-established capability in circuit quantum elec-\ntrodynamics. Fig. 4a shows conditional density matrices,\nρ(e), ρ(l), ρ(+), ρ(−)of the microwave output state corre-\nsponding to an optical click in the early, late, + and −\nmodes, respectively. For a pure Bell state, the entries\nhighlighted with colored bars in ρ(e), ρ(l)are expected to\nhave the values ρ(e)\n10,10=ρ(l)\n01,01= 1, ρ(e)\n01,01=ρ(l)\n10,10= 0;\nlike\nn ρ(e), ρ(l)are expected to\nhave the values ρ(e)\n10,10=ρ(l)\n01,01= 1, ρ(e)\n01,01=ρ(l)\n10,10= 0;\nlikewise, the the entries highlighted with colored bars in\nρ(+), ρ(-)are expected to have a magnitude of 0.5. The\nmain deviation in the measured conditional microwave\nstates is due to the non-zero vacuum component, pri-\nmarily from finite conversion efficiency, ηmw= 0.59 of a\nsingle phonon into the microwave waveguide. Using the\nentries highlighted with colored bars in Fig. 4a, which\ndenote the computational subspace of the dual-rail pho-\ntonic qubit, we obtain the conditional probability, pijof\na single microwave photon in mode jconditioned on re-\nceipt of an optical click in mode i[19]. Here i, jrun\nover early and late (+ and −) modes for Z- (X-) basis\nmeasurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. Er-\nror bars on the probabilities account for statistical error\nobtained by bootstrapping with replacement over the mi-\ncrowave dataset. These conditional probabilities allow us\nto establish a lower bound on the Bell state fidelity given\nby [9, 12]\nFlb=1\n2(pee+pll−pel−ple\n+p+++p−−−2√p+−p−+). (2)\nWe find that Flb= 0.794+0.048\n−0.071, which exceeds the clas-\nsical limit of 0.5 by over four standard deviations, in-\ndicating the preparation of entangled microwave-optical\nstates. A simple model accounting for pump-induced\nthermal noise in the transducer [19] predicts Bell state\nfidelity exceeding 0.83, which agrees with the measured\nlower bound. In addition to the primary reduction in the\nfidelity due to pump-induced noise, we expect smaller\ncontributions due to dark counts and imperfections in\noptical time-bin interference and microwave mode match-\ning.6\nWe envision that the microwave photonic qubit emit-\nted by our entanglement source can be absorbed in a\ndual-rail superconducting qubit [12] or a superconducting\nqutrit [15], both of which can be realized with standard\ntransmons and can enable detection of microwave photon\nloss errors. Such a transmon module can be connected\nns and can enable detection of microwave photon\nloss errors. Such a transmon module can be connected\nto the transducer with minimal impact of optical pump\nlight on qubit coherence [23–26]. In the near term, piezo-\noptomechanical transducers with greater acoustic partic-ipation in silicon [27, 28] and improved thermalization\nwith the substrate [29] can improve transducer noise per-\nformance, enabling microwave-optical entanglement gen-\neration rates in the kHz range. Transducer operation in\nthis performance regime can facilitate the integration of\nsuperconducting qubit nodes into optical quantum net-\nworks for applications in secure communication [30–32]\nand distributed sensing [33–35].\n[1] M.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe experimental setup used in this work is a modi-\nfied version of the one used in our recent demonstration of\nnon-classical microwave-optical photon pairs [1]. Fig. S1a\nshows relevant upgrades to the optical setup that en-\nabled us to generate and characterize microwave-optical\nBell states. The microwave measurement chain shown\nin Fig. S1b and the heralding setup are identical to the\none used in Ref. [1]. Pump pulses used to excite the\ntransducer are generated via amplitude and phase mod-\nulation of a continuous-wave external cavity diode laser.\nOur pulse generation setup uses two acousto-optic mod-\nulators (AOMs) in series for amplitude modulation and\nan electro-optic modulator (EOM) for phase modulation.\nBy applying a rectangular voltage pulse of amplitude,\nVeomto the phase modulator over the duration of the\nlate pump pulse, we control the relative phase between\nthe pump pulses, ϕpintroduced in the main text. Po-\nlarization of pump light sent to the device is controlled\nusing an electronic fiber polarization controller (FPC).\nDuring long data acquisition runs, we mitigate the im-\npact of long term polarization drifts along the excitation\npath through active polarization control.\nPump pulses are sent to the transducer in the dilutionarXiv:2312.13559v2  [quant-ph]  22 Dec 2023S2\nDUT\nFabry-Perot cavity\nSNSPDe-iφo\n/f_iber beamsplitter /f_iber delay line\n/f_iber stretcher e-iφopulse generation\nAOM EOMinterferometer lock\npump /f_ilter lockpump laser\n/f_iber polarization\ncontrollercirculatorAOMelectro-optic\nphase modulatoracousto-optic\nmodulator/f_iber polarizer\nlock detector 2x2 /f_iber switchinterferometer\npump /f_ilter bankAOM\noptical signal\nEOMDF setupoptics in/out\nMW out\nDUT\nTWPAHEMT\nMXC plateCold plat\npump /f_ilter bankAOM\noptical signal\nEOMDF setupoptics in/out\nMW out\nDUT\nTWPAHEMT\nMXC plateCold plateStill plate4K plate50K plateoptics in/out\n300K plate/gid00049/gid00048\nADCMW \nout\nADCampli/f_ierTWPA pumprejection /f_ilterIQ mixer\nbandpass/f_ilteranalog to digitalconverter\nFIG. S1. Schematic of experimental setup. a. Schematic of optical setup highlighting essential components for the\nmicrowave-optical Bell state experiment. A more detailed schematic is provided in previous work [1]. Dotted rectangular\nblocks encompass the pump pulse generation module, the dilution fridge (DF) setup, interferometer used for X-basis optical\nmeasurements, and the pump filter bank. Individual components are labeled in the key below the schematic. b.Schematic of\nDF setup and the microwave amplification chain with Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier (TWPA) mounted on the\nmixing chamber (MXC) plate and high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier mounted on the 4K plate.\nfridge (DF) setup through a circulator, which allows us to\ndirect optical emission along with reflected pump pulses\nto the detection setup. At the beginning of the detection\npath, a 2x2 switch allows us to route the signal to a home-\nbuilt time-delay interferometer for X-basis measurements\nor to bypass it for Z-basis measurements. Prior to optical\ndetection on a superconducting nanowire single photon\ndetector (SNSPD), the signal is passed through a pump\nfilter bank comprising two tunable Fabry-Perot cavities.\nThese cavities are locked on resonance with the trans-\nducer optical resonance frequency, ωousing a reference\ntone derived from the pump laser (‘pump filter lock’ path\ncolored in purple in Fig. S1a). Details of the locking pro-\ncedure, which is performed once every four minutes dur-\ning data acquisition, have been described previously [1].\nFor the current experiment, we upgraded to higher band-\nwidth filters (individual cavity bandwidth of 6MHz com-\npared with 3.6MHz in the old setup), which allowed\nfilters (individual cavity bandwidth of 6MHz com-\npared with 3.6MHz in the old setup), which allowed us\nto work with pump pulses of shorter duration. Including\na circulator and two 2x2 fiber-optic switches, this up-\ngraded filter bank has a total on-resonance insertion lossof 2.6dB at the signal frequency while providing 105dB\nextinction at the pump frequency.\nOptical time-bin interference for X-basis measure-\nments is realized in an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder inter-\nferometer placed inside a thermally insulated enclosure.\nA relative path difference of 53m is achieved via a fiber\nspool of fixed length in one of the arms of the inter-\nferometer. This path difference is pre-calculated and,\nupon insertion of the fiber spool into the setup, is ex-\nperimentally verified to achieve the desired time delay,\nTd= 279ns between the optical time-bins. Optical emis-\nsion from the transducer is directed into one of the two\ninput ports of the interferometer while the single pho-\nton detection path is connected to one of the two output\nports. The other input and output of the interferometer\nare used to transmit a lock tone (‘interferometer lock’\npath colored in blue in Fig. S1a), and actively stabilize\nthe relative phase between the arms. Phase stabilization\nis achieved by measuring the power of the lock tone at\nthe interferometer output on a photodetector, and con-\ntrolling a piezoelectric fiber stretcher (Optiphase PZ1,S3\n20kHz bandwidth) in the longer arm. PID feedback on\nthe fiber stretcher is implemented using a Toptica Dig-\nilock 110 module. The interferometer lock tone is picked\noff from the pump laser via a beamsplitter upstream of\nthe pulse generation module in the excitation path. Since\nthe lock tone has the same center frequency as the pump\npulses, it is largely extinguished by the pump filter bank\non the single photon detection path. However, for the\nlock tone power of 400nW used in our experiment, we find\nsignificant bleedthrough of 500 counts/s on the SNSPD.\nTo prevent f\n used in our experiment, we find\nsignificant bleedthrough of 500 counts/s on the SNSPD.\nTo prevent false heralding events from this bleedthrough,\nan AOM is used to shut off the lock tone in a 2 µs window\ncentered in time around the pump pulses used to excite\ntransducer. This off-duration is much shorter than the\ndrift timescale of the setup. A sample-and-hold setup\non the electrical output of the lock photodetector is trig-\ngered in sync with the pulses applied to the lock tone.\nThis ensures that the input to the PID controller does\nnot drop to zero during the brief period for which the\nlock tone is turned off.\nBefore commencing X-basis measurements, polariza-\ntion alignment for light incident on the output beamsplit-\nter of the interferometer is performed by adjusting paddle\nFPCs shown in Fig. S1a through the following procedure.\nFirst, a fiber polarizer inserted into the lock input arm\nallows us to define a fixed reference input polarization\ninto the interferometer. The variable beamsplitters in the\ninterferometer, which have a weak (few %) polarization\ndependence, are balanced for this reference polarization\nin the lock input arm. Following this step, the FPC in-\nside the interferometer enclosure is adjusted to maximize\ninterference visibility for the lock tone. Finally, polar-\nization of light from the transducer arriving in the signal\ninput arm is aligned to our fixed reference polarization in\nthe lock arm. This is achieved by adjusting the FPC in\nthe signal input arm to maximize the intensity of the RF\nbeat note between signal and lock frequencies as observed\non the lock photodetector.\nDuring X-basis data acquisition, the interference visi-\nbility for optical pulses emitted by the transducer is peri-\nodically monitored via a calibration procedure described\nin Section 3. We found that the passive stability of the in-\nterferometer setup was sufficient to maintain an average\nvisibility of 94% for signal pulses over the measurement\nduration of the X-basis dataset.\nan average\nvisibility of 94% for signal pulses over the measurement\nduration of the X-basis dataset. Approximately 4% re-\nduction in visibility is due to finite overlap of the optical\ntime-bins. The remaining 2% reduction in visibility can\nbe attributed to slow fluctuations of polarization along\nthe signal collection path and of temperature inside the\ninterferometer enclosure.\n3. PHASE CALIBRATION FOR OPTICAL\nX-BASIS MEASUREMENT\nDuring X-basis measurements, the fiber stretcher in\nFig. S1a is actively stabilized to lock the interferometer\nat the halfway point on interference fringes generated bythe lock tone on the output detector. This corresponds to\na relative phase, ϕlock= 3π/2 between the interferometer\narms at the lock tone frequency. Since the optical sig-\nnal from the transducer has a different center frequency\nthan the lock tone, a different but fixed relative phase,\nϕois imprinted between the two time-bins in the signal.\nTo calibrate ϕo, the transducer is optically pumped with\nthe double Gaussian pulse sequence used in the entan-\nglement experiment. At the same time, the microwave\nport of the transducer is excited with a CW electrical\ntone at the microwave resonance frequency, ωm. Under\nsimultaneous optical and microwave excitation in this\nmanner, the transducer generates two large-amplitude\ncoherent states in the optical early and late modes ex-\npected in the SPDC signal. After passing these coherent\noptical pulses through the phase-stabilized interferome-\nter and the pump filter bank, we measure a time trace\nof the resulting optical intensity on the SNSPD by his-\ntogramming photon arrival times as shown in Fig. S2a.\nFig. S2b shows a typical phase calibration curve where\ngated counts in the interference window are measured as\nthe phase between the pump pulses, ϕpis swept by con-\ntrolling Veom, the amplitude of the voltage pulse applied\nto the EOM in the pulse generation module in Fig. S1a.\nA cosine fit to such an interference curve with the expres-\nsion, Ac\n generation module in Fig. S1a.\nA cosine fit to such an interference curve with the expres-\nsion, Acos(kVeom+ϕo) +Ballows us to calibrate both\nϕp=kVeomandϕo. Sweeping ϕpviaVeomproduces an\neffect equivalent to sweeping ϕovia the interferometer\nlock setpoint, ϕlock. This is shown by the two interference\ncurves in Fig. S2b which are taken for two lock settings of\nthe interferometer where ϕlock, and hence, ϕois changed\nbyπ. From an experimental standpoint, controlling ϕp\nand fixing ϕoensures identical locking stability for the in-\nterferometer for the optical measurement phases of inter-\nest in our X-basis measurements. During a long X-basis\ndata acquisition run, we periodically verify our calibra-\ntion for the optical phase by performing this routine every\ntwo hours. Fig. S2c shows a histogram of the total opti-\ncal phase, ϕp+ϕofrom calibration runs performed over\nthe month-long duration of the measurement, indicating\nnearly normal distributions with standard deviation of\n0.04π.\n4. MICROWAVE MODE ENVELOPE\nIn our experiments, the superconducting electrical res-\nonator is tuned into resonance with the transducer acous-\ntic mode such that the electro-acoustic coupled mode sys-\ntem is at its maximal hybridization point.

When two optical pump pulses ex-\ncite the device at t= 0, Td, the corresponding microwave\nemission envelopes, f(t), f(t−Td) are exactly orthogo-\nnal when Td=π/|λ+−λ−|= 279ns. In Fig. 1c of the\nmain text, we plot |f(t)|2and|f(t−Td)|2as the intensity\nenvelopes of the theoretically expected early and late mi-\ncrowave modes. For Z-basis intensity measurements, we\nconvolve the digitized, down-converted microwave volt-\nage signal, V(t) with fand estimate the microwave\nquanta, |/integraltext\nf∗(t−τ)V(t)dt|2/(2ZoGℏωm), where τis a\nvariab\nith fand estimate the microwave\nquanta, |/integraltext\nf∗(t−τ)V(t)dt|2/(2ZoGℏωm), where τis a\nvariable readout delay, Zo= 50Ω, and G= 107 .4dB,\nthe gain of the amplification chain referred to the out-\nput of the transducer chip, is calibrated via optomechan-\nical sideband asymmetry and microwave spectroscopy\n[1].

MICROWAVE DATA PROCESSING\nOur microwave data processing approach follows tech-\nniques originally developed in Ref. [3, 4] for quantum\nstate tomography of itinerant microwave photons. These\ntechniques have been used in recent demonstrations of\nentangled microwave photons [5–7]. With the goal of\nsubtracting amplifier-added noise, modes at the output\nof the heterodyne setup are related to the modes exiting\nthe transducer via the input-output relation of a phase\ninsensitive bosonic amplifier[3, 8],\nˆSe=√\nGˆCe+√\nG−1ˆH†\ne, (4a)\nˆSl=√\nGˆCl+√\nG−1ˆH†\nl.

The mean of the distribution\nis indicated by the red dashed line, and the result from max-\nimum likelihood estimation over the datasets is shown by the\nblack dashed line.\nTo determine the statistical uncertainty on the ML\ndensity matrices, we employ a parametric bootstrapping\nprocedure [11] with 103re-sampling iterations over the\ndatasets with conditional hete\n bootstrapping\nprocedure [11] with 103re-sampling iterations over the\ndatasets with conditional heterodyne voltage samples.\nIn each bootstrapping iteration, a sample of ρ(i)is gen-\nerated by executing the optimization routine in Eq. 12\nwith moments randomly sampled from a multivariate\nnormal distribution with the experimentally measured\nmean ¯Cβand variance σ2\nβ. From the ensemble of con-\nditional density matrices generated with this procedure,S6\nwe estimate marginal distributions associated with the\nconditional probabilities, pijof a single microwave pho-\nton in mode jgiven a single optical photon detection\nevent in mode ias defined in Section 6. Here i, j∈ {e,l}\nfor Z-basis measurements and {+,−}for X-basis mea-\nsurements. These marginal distributions are shown in\nFig. S3. It is well-established that there can be slight\nbias between the mean of the distribution generated from\nbootstrapping and the ML estimate of the density ma-\ntrix due to a combination of nonlinearities in the es-\ntimator and physical constraints on the density matrix\n[12]. In our case, we calculate a mean value for the Bell\nstate fidelity lower bound, Flb= 0.83 using the mean\nvalues of the conditional probabilities from the boot-\nstrapping procedure (red vertical lines in Fig. S3), which\nis slightly higher than value of 0.79 from the ML esti-\nmates for the same probabilities (black vertical lines in\nFig. S3). To take such systematic bias into account, we\ngenerate conservative confidence intervals for each pijas\n[min{µij, pML\nij}−σij,max{µij, pML\nij}+σij], where µij, σij\nare the mean and standard deviation of the distribu-\ntions, respectively and pML\nijis the ML estimate from the\ndataset. Using these conservative confidence intervals,\nshown with the error bars on Fig. 4b of the main text,\nwe estimate Flb= 0.794+0.048\n−0.071which is above 0.5 by over\nfour standard deviations.\n6.

The normalization term in\nthe denominator corresponds to post-selection of the sin-\ngle microwave photon subspace. These conditional single\nphoton probabilities enable us to bound the Bell state\nfidelity using Eq. (2) of the main text [13, 14].7. CONTRIBUTION OF TWO PHOTON\nEVENTS TO THE HERALDING SIGNAL\nOur analysis for the Bell state fidelity uses the condi-\ntion that the optical heralding events used for conditional\nmicrowave readout are due to detection of single pho-\ntons. In our experiments, the fraction of optical heralding\nevents due to terms with more than one optical photon\nis expected to be of the order of p= 1×10−4, a negli-\ngible fraction of the dataset. These events do not have\na statistically significant impact on the lower bound for\nthe Bell state fidelity.\n8.

Parameters for the conditional microwave state\nmodel. Thermal noise parameters are independently deter-\nmined from the unconditional microwave signal shown by the\ndashed time trace in Fig. 2c of the main text. Microwave ex-\ntraction efficiency, ηextis determined from an independent\nmeasurement of the conditional microwave intensity when\nthe transducer is excited with a single pump \neasurement of the conditional microwave intensity when\nthe transducer is excited with a single pump pulse. ηext\nis less than the theoretical microwave conversion efficiency,\nηmw=0.59 due to imperfections in mode-matching with the\nmatched filter.\nHere we present a numerical model for the microwave-\noptical entangled state by incorporating the level of\npump-induced noise in the transducer. This is an exten-\nsion of a simple model presented in our previous work\non microwave-optical photon-pair generation [1].

Detection of a single optical photon in mode ˆAi\nsignifies successful pair generation and condition-\nally adds a single excitation to the microwave mode\nˆCi. The microwave state undergoes a quantum\njump into a photon-added thermal state: ρth→\nˆC†\niρthˆCi/Tr{ˆC†\niρthˆCi}.\n2. This photon-added thermal state is extracted with\nfinite efficiency, ηextand additional thermal noise\nquanta, ¯ nd,e(¯nd,l) added to the early (late) mi-\ncrowave mode due to delayed heating of the trans-\nducer after the pump pulse. These effects are to-\ngether modeled as an imperfect beamsplitter trans-\nformation on both early and late modes.
